chapter i 
emma woodhouse handsome clever and rich with a comfortable home 
and happy disposition seemed to unite some of the best blessings 
of existence and had lived nearly twenty one years in the world 
with very little to distress or vex her 
she was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate 
indulgent father and had in consequence of her sister s marriage 
been mistress of his house from a very early period her mother 
had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct 
remembrance of her caresses and her place had been supplied 
by an excellent woman as governess who had fallen little short 
of a mother in affection 
sixteen years had miss taylor been in mr woodhouse s family 
less as a governess than a friend very fond of both daughters 
but particularly of emma between them it was more the intimacy 
of sisters even before miss taylor had ceased to hold the nominal 
office of governess the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed 
her to impose any restraint and the shadow of authority being 
now long passed away they had been living together as friend and 
friend very mutually attached and emma doing just what she liked 
highly esteeming miss taylor s judgment but directed chiefly by 
her own 
the real evils indeed of emma s situation were the power of having 
rather too much her own way and a disposition to think a little 
too well of herself these were the disadvantages which threatened 
alloy to her many enjoyments the danger however was at present 
so unperceived that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes 
with her 
sorrow came a gentle sorrow but not at all in the shape of any 
disagreeable consciousness miss taylor married it was miss 
taylor s loss which first brought grief it was on the wedding day 
of this beloved friend that emma first sat in mournful thought 
of any continuance the wedding over and the bride people gone 
her father and herself were left to dine together with no prospect 
of a third to cheer a long evening her father composed himself 
to sleep after dinner as usual and she had then only to sit 
and think of what she had lost 
the event had every promise of happiness for her friend mr weston 
was a man of unexceptionable character easy fortune suitable age 
and pleasant manners and there was some satisfaction in considering 
with what self denying generous friendship she had always wished 
and promoted the match but it was a black morning s work for her 
the want of miss taylor would be felt every hour of every day 
she recalled her past kindness the kindness the affection of sixteen 
years how she had taught and how she had played with her from five 
years old how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse 
her in health and how nursed her through the various illnesses 
of childhood a large debt of gratitude was owing here but the 
intercourse of the last seven years the equal footing and perfect 
unreserve which had soon followed isabella s marriage on their 
being left to each other was yet a dearer tenderer recollection 
she had been a friend and companion such as few possessed intelligent 
well informed useful gentle knowing all the ways of the family 
interested in all its concerns and peculiarly interested in herself 
in every pleasure every scheme of hers one to whom she could speak 
every thought as it arose and who had such an affection for her 
as could never find fault 
how was she to bear the change it was true that her friend was 
going only half a mile from them but emma was aware that great must 
be the difference between a mrs weston only half a mile from them 
and a miss taylor in the house and with all her advantages 
natural and domestic she was now in great danger of suffering 
from intellectual solitude she dearly loved her father but he 
was no companion for her he could not meet her in conversation 
rational or playful 
the evil of the actual disparity in their ages and mr woodhouse had 
not married early was much increased by his constitution and habits 
for having been a valetudinarian all his life without activity 
of mind or body he was a much older man in ways than in years 
and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart 
and his amiable temper his talents could not have recommended him 
at any time 
her sister though comparatively but little removed by matrimony 
being settled in london only sixteen miles off was much beyond 
her daily reach and many a long october and november evening must 
be struggled through at hartfield before christmas brought the next 
visit from isabella and her husband and their little children 
to fill the house and give her pleasant society again 
highbury the large and populous village almost amounting to a town 
to which hartfield in spite of its separate lawn and shrubberies 
and name did really belong afforded her no equals the woodhouses 
were first in consequence there all looked up to them she had 
many acquaintance in the place for her father was universally civil 
but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of miss 
taylor for even half a day it was a melancholy change and emma 
could not but sigh over it and wish for impossible things 
till her father awoke and made it necessary to be cheerful 
his spirits required support he was a nervous man easily depressed 
fond of every body that he was used to and hating to part with them 
hating change of every kind matrimony as the origin of change 
was always disagreeable and he was by no means yet reconciled 
to his own daughter s marrying nor could ever speak of her but 
with compassion though it had been entirely a match of affection 
when he was now obliged to part with miss taylor too and from 
his habits of gentle selfishness and of being never able to 
suppose that other people could feel differently from himself 
he was very much disposed to think miss taylor had done as sad 
a thing for herself as for them and would have been a great deal 
happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at hartfield 
emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could to keep him 
from such thoughts but when tea came it was impossible for him 
not to say exactly as he had said at dinner 
poor miss taylor i wish she were here again what a pity it 
is that mr weston ever thought of her 
i cannot agree with you papa you know i cannot mr weston is such 
a good humoured pleasant excellent man that he thoroughly deserves 
a good wife and you would not have had miss taylor live with us 
for ever and bear all my odd humours when she might have a house of her own 
a house of her own but where is the advantage of a house of her own 
this is three times as large and you have never any odd humours 
my dear 
how often we shall be going to see them and they coming to see 
us we shall be always meeting we must begin we must go and pay 
wedding visit very soon 
my dear how am i to get so far randalls is such a distance 
i could not walk half so far 
no papa nobody thought of your walking we must go in the carriage 
to be sure 
the carriage but james will not like to put the horses to for 
such a little way and where are the poor horses to be while we 
are paying our visit 
they are to be put into mr weston s stable papa you know we 
have settled all that already we talked it all over with mr weston 
last night and as for james you may be very sure he will always like 
going to randalls because of his daughter s being housemaid there 
i only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else that was 
your doing papa you got hannah that good place nobody thought 
of hannah till you mentioned her james is so obliged to you 
i am very glad i did think of her it was very lucky for i would 
not have had poor james think himself slighted upon any account 
and i am sure she will make a very good servant she is a civil 
pretty spoken girl i have a great opinion of her whenever i see her 
she always curtseys and asks me how i do in a very pretty manner 
and when you have had her here to do needlework i observe she 
always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it 
i am sure she will be an excellent servant and it will be a great 
comfort to poor miss taylor to have somebody about her that she is 
used to see whenever james goes over to see his daughter you know 
she will be hearing of us he will be able to tell her how we 
all are 
emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas 
and hoped by the help of backgammon to get her father tolerably 
through the evening and be attacked by no regrets but her own 
the backgammon table was placed but a visitor immediately afterwards 
walked in and made it unnecessary 
mr knightley a sensible man about seven or eight and thirty was not 
only a very old and intimate friend of the family but particularly 
connected with it as the elder brother of isabella s husband 
he lived about a mile from highbury was a frequent visitor 
and always welcome and at this time more welcome than usual 
as coming directly from their mutual connexions in london he had 
returned to a late dinner after some days absence and now walked 
up to hartfield to say that all were well in brunswick square 
it was a happy circumstance and animated mr woodhouse for some time 
mr knightley had a cheerful manner which always did him good 
and his many inquiries after poor isabella and her children were 
answered most satisfactorily when this was over mr woodhouse 
gratefully observed it is very kind of you mr knightley to come 
out at this late hour to call upon us i am afraid you must have 
had a shocking walk 
not at all sir it is a beautiful moonlight night and so mild 
that i must draw back from your great fire 
but you must have found it very damp and dirty i wish you may 
not catch cold 
dirty sir look at my shoes not a speck on them 
well that is quite surprising for we have had a vast deal 
of rain here it rained dreadfully hard for half an hour 
while we were at breakfast i wanted them to put off the wedding 
by the bye i have not wished you joy being pretty well aware 
of what sort of joy you must both be feeling i have been in no hurry 
with my congratulations but i hope it all went off tolerably well 
how did you all behave who cried most 
ah poor miss taylor it is a sad business 
poor mr and miss woodhouse if you please but i cannot possibly 
say poor miss taylor i have a great regard for you and emma 
but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence at 
any rate it must be better to have only one to please than two 
especially when one of those two is such a fanciful troublesome creature 
said emma playfully that is what you have in your head 
i know and what you would certainly say if my father were not by 
i believe it is very true my dear indeed said mr woodhouse 
with a sigh i am afraid i am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome 
my dearest papa you do not think i could mean you or suppose 
mr knightley to mean you what a horrible idea oh no i meant 
only myself mr knightley loves to find fault with me you know 
in a joke it is all a joke we always say what we like to one another 
mr knightley in fact was one of the few people who could see 
faults in emma woodhouse and the only one who ever told her of them 
and though this was not particularly agreeable to emma herself 
she knew it would be so much less so to her father that she would 
not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being 
thought perfect by every body 
emma knows i never flatter her said mr knightley but i 
meant no reflection on any body miss taylor has been used 
to have two persons to please she will now have but one 
the chances are that she must be a gainer 
well said emma willing to let it pass you want to hear 
about the wedding and i shall be happy to tell you for we all 
behaved charmingly every body was punctual every body in their 
best looks not a tear and hardly a long face to be seen oh no 
we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart 
and were sure of meeting every day 
dear emma bears every thing so well said her father 
but mr knightley she is really very sorry to lose poor miss taylor 
and i am sure she will miss her more than she thinks for 
emma turned away her head divided between tears and smiles 
it is impossible that emma should not miss such a companion 
said mr knightley we should not like her so well as we do sir 
if we could suppose it but she knows how much the marriage is to 
miss taylor s advantage she knows how very acceptable it must be 
at miss taylor s time of life to be settled in a home of her own 
and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision 
and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure 
every friend of miss taylor must be glad to have her so happily 
married 
and you have forgotten one matter of joy to me said emma 
and a very considerable one that i made the match myself 
i made the match you know four years ago and to have it take place 
and be proved in the right when so many people said mr weston would 
never marry again may comfort me for any thing 
mr knightley shook his head at her her father fondly replied 
ah my dear i wish you would not make matches and foretell things 
for whatever you say always comes to pass pray do not make any 
more matches 
i promise you to make none for myself papa but i must indeed 
for other people it is the greatest amusement in the world and 
after such success you know every body said that mr weston would 
never marry again oh dear no mr weston who had been a widower 
so long and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife 
so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his 
friends here always acceptable wherever he went always cheerful 
mr weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did 
not like it oh no mr weston certainly would never marry again 
some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed 
and others of the son and the uncle not letting him all manner 
of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject but i believed none 
of it 
ever since the day about four years ago that miss taylor and i 
met with him in broadway lane when because it began to drizzle 
he darted away with so much gallantry and borrowed two umbrellas 
for us from farmer mitchell s i made up my mind on the subject 
i planned the match from that hour and when such success has blessed 
me in this instance dear papa you cannot think that i shall leave 
off match making 
i do not understand what you mean by success said mr knightley 
success supposes endeavour your time has been properly and 
delicately spent if you have been endeavouring for the last four 
years to bring about this marriage a worthy employment for a young 
lady s mind but if which i rather imagine your making the match 
as you call it means only your planning it your saying to yourself 
one idle day i think it would be a very good thing for miss taylor 
if mr weston were to marry her and saying it again to yourself 
every now and then afterwards why do you talk of success where 
is your merit what are you proud of you made a lucky guess 
and that is all that can be said 
and have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess 
i pity you i thought you cleverer for depend upon it a lucky 
guess is never merely luck there is always some talent in it 
and as to my poor word success which you quarrel with i do not 
know that i am so entirely without any claim to it you have drawn 
two pretty pictures but i think there may be a third a something 
between the do nothing and the do all if i had not promoted mr weston s 
visits here and given many little encouragements and smoothed 
many little matters it might not have come to any thing after all 
i think you must know hartfield enough to comprehend that 
a straightforward open hearted man like weston and a rational 
unaffected woman like miss taylor may be safely left to manage their 
own concerns you are more likely to have done harm to yourself 
than good to them by interference 
emma never thinks of herself if she can do good to others 
rejoined mr woodhouse understanding but in part but my dear 
pray do not make any more matches they are silly things and break up 
one s family circle grievously 
only one more papa only for mr elton poor mr elton you 
like mr elton papa i must look about for a wife for him 
there is nobody in highbury who deserves him and he has been 
here a whole year and has fitted up his house so comfortably 
that it would be a shame to have him single any longer and i thought 
when he was joining their hands to day he looked so very much as if 
he would like to have the same kind office done for him i think 
very well of mr elton and this is the only way i have of doing 
him a service 
mr elton is a very pretty young man to be sure and a very 
good young man and i have a great regard for him but if you 
want to shew him any attention my dear ask him to come 
and dine with us some day that will be a much better thing 
i dare say mr knightley will be so kind as to meet him 
with a great deal of pleasure sir at any time said mr knightley 
laughing and i agree with you entirely that it will be a much 
better thing invite him to dinner emma and help him to the best 
of the fish and the chicken but leave him to chuse his own wife 
depend upon it a man of six or seven and twenty can take care 
of himself 
chapter ii 
mr weston was a native of highbury and born of a respectable family 
which for the last two or three generations had been rising into 
gentility and property he had received a good education but 
on succeeding early in life to a small independence had become 
indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers 
were engaged and had satisfied an active cheerful mind and social 
temper by entering into the militia of his county then embodied 
captain weston was a general favourite and when the chances 
of his military life had introduced him to miss churchill 
of a great yorkshire family and miss churchill fell in love 
with him nobody was surprized except her brother and his wife 
who had never seen him and who were full of pride and importance 
which the connexion would offend 
miss churchill however being of age and with the full command 
of her fortune though her fortune bore no proportion to the 
family estate was not to be dissuaded from the marriage and it 
took place to the infinite mortification of mr and mrs churchill 
who threw her off with due decorum it was an unsuitable connexion 
and did not produce much happiness mrs weston ought to have found 
more in it for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper 
made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness 
of being in love with him but though she had one sort of spirit 
she had not the best she had resolution enough to pursue 
her own will in spite of her brother but not enough to refrain 
from unreasonable regrets at that brother s unreasonable anger 
nor from missing the luxuries of her former home they lived beyond 
their income but still it was nothing in comparison of enscombe 
she did not cease to love her husband but she wanted at once 
to be the wife of captain weston and miss churchill of enscombe 
captain weston who had been considered especially by the churchills 
as making such an amazing match was proved to have much the worst 
of the bargain for when his wife died after a three years marriage 
he was rather a poorer man than at first and with a child to maintain 
from the expense of the child however he was soon relieved 
the boy had with the additional softening claim of a lingering 
illness of his mother s been the means of a sort of reconciliation 
and mr and mrs churchill having no children of their own 
nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for offered to 
take the whole charge of the little frank soon after her decease 
some scruples and some reluctance the widower father may be supposed 
to have felt but as they were overcome by other considerations 
the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the churchills 
and he had only his own comfort to seek and his own situation to 
improve as he could 
a complete change of life became desirable he quitted the militia 
and engaged in trade having brothers already established in a 
good way in london which afforded him a favourable opening 
it was a concern which brought just employment enough he had still 
a small house in highbury where most of his leisure days were spent 
and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society 
the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away 
he had by that time realised an easy competence enough to secure 
the purchase of a little estate adjoining highbury which he had 
always longed for enough to marry a woman as portionless even 
as miss taylor and to live according to the wishes of his own 
friendly and social disposition 
it was now some time since miss taylor had begun to influence 
his schemes but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth 
on youth it had not shaken his determination of never settling 
till he could purchase randalls and the sale of randalls was long 
looked forward to but he had gone steadily on with these objects 
in view till they were accomplished he had made his fortune 
bought his house and obtained his wife and was beginning a new 
period of existence with every probability of greater happiness 
than in any yet passed through he had never been an unhappy man 
his own temper had secured him from that even in his first marriage 
but his second must shew him how delightful a well judging and truly 
amiable woman could be and must give him the pleasantest proof 
of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen 
to excite gratitude than to feel it 
he had only himself to please in his choice his fortune was 
his own for as to frank it was more than being tacitly brought 
up as his uncle s heir it had become so avowed an adoption 
as to have him assume the name of churchill on coming of age 
it was most unlikely therefore that he should ever want his 
father s assistance his father had no apprehension of it 
the aunt was a capricious woman and governed her husband entirely 
but it was not in mr weston s nature to imagine that any caprice 
could be strong enough to affect one so dear and as he believed 
so deservedly dear he saw his son every year in london 
and was proud of him and his fond report of him as a very fine 
young man had made highbury feel a sort of pride in him too 
he was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his 
merits and prospects a kind of common concern 
mr frank churchill was one of the boasts of highbury and a lively 
curiosity to see him prevailed though the compliment was so little 
returned that he had never been there in his life his coming 
to visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved 
now upon his father s marriage it was very generally proposed 
as a most proper attention that the visit should take place 
there was not a dissentient voice on the subject either when 
mrs perry drank tea with mrs and miss bates or when mrs and 
miss bates returned the visit now was the time for mr frank 
churchill to come among them and the hope strengthened when it was 
understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion 
for a few days every morning visit in highbury included some mention 
of the handsome letter mrs weston had received i suppose you 
have heard of the handsome letter mr frank churchill has written 
to mrs weston i understand it was a very handsome letter indeed 
mr woodhouse told me of it mr woodhouse saw the letter and he 
says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life 
it was indeed a highly prized letter mrs weston had of course 
formed a very favourable idea of the young man and such a pleasing 
attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense 
and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression 
of congratulation which her marriage had already secured she felt 
herself a most fortunate woman and she had lived long enough 
to know how fortunate she might well be thought where the only 
regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship 
for her had never cooled and who could ill bear to part with her 
she knew that at times she must be missed and could not think 
without pain of emma s losing a single pleasure or suffering 
an hour s ennui from the want of her companionableness but dear 
emma was of no feeble character she was more equal to her situation 
than most girls would have been and had sense and energy 
and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily 
through its little difficulties and privations and then there was 
such comfort in the very easy distance of randalls from hartfield 
so convenient for even solitary female walking and in mr weston s 
disposition and circumstances which would make the approaching 
season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the 
week together 
her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude 
to mrs weston and of moments only of regret and her 
satisfaction her more than satisfaction her cheerful enjoyment 
was so just and so apparent that emma well as she knew her father 
was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity 
poor miss taylor when they left her at randalls in the centre 
of every domestic comfort or saw her go away in the evening 
attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own 
but never did she go without mr woodhouse s giving a gentle sigh 
and saying ah poor miss taylor she would be very glad to stay 
there was no recovering miss taylor nor much likelihood of 
ceasing to pity her but a few weeks brought some alleviation 
to mr woodhouse the compliments of his neighbours were over 
he was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event 
and the wedding cake which had been a great distress to him 
was all eat up his own stomach could bear nothing rich and he 
could never believe other people to be different from himself 
what was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body 
and he had therefore earnestly tried to dissuade them from having 
any wedding cake at all and when that proved vain as earnestly 
tried to prevent any body s eating it he had been at the pains 
of consulting mr perry the apothecary on the subject mr perry 
was an intelligent gentlemanlike man whose frequent visits were one 
of the comforts of mr woodhouse s life and upon being applied to 
he could not but acknowledge though it seemed rather against the 
bias of inclination that wedding cake might certainly disagree 
with many perhaps with most people unless taken moderately 
with such an opinion in confirmation of his own mr woodhouse hoped 
to influence every visitor of the newly married pair but still the 
cake was eaten and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till 
it was all gone 
there was a strange rumour in highbury of all the little perrys 
being seen with a slice of mrs weston s wedding cake in their 
hands but mr woodhouse would never believe it 
chapter iii 
mr woodhouse was fond of society in his own way he liked very much 
to have his friends come and see him and from various united causes 
from his long residence at hartfield and his good nature 
from his fortune his house and his daughter he could command the 
visits of his own little circle in a great measure as he liked 
he had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle 
his horror of late hours and large dinner parties made him unfit 
for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms 
fortunately for him highbury including randalls in the same parish 
and donwell abbey in the parish adjoining the seat of mr knightley 
comprehended many such not unfrequently through emma s persuasion 
he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him but evening 
parties were what he preferred and unless he fancied himself at any 
time unequal to company there was scarcely an evening in the week 
in which emma could not make up a card table for him 
real long standing regard brought the westons and mr knightley 
and by mr elton a young man living alone without liking it 
the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude 
for the elegancies and society of mr woodhouse s drawing room 
and the smiles of his lovely daughter was in no danger of being 
thrown away 
after these came a second set among the most come at able 
of whom were mrs and miss bates and mrs goddard three ladies 
almost always at the service of an invitation from hartfield 
and who were fetched and carried home so often that mr woodhouse 
thought it no hardship for either james or the horses had it 
taken place only once a year it would have been a grievance 
mrs bates the widow of a former vicar of highbury was a 
very old lady almost past every thing but tea and quadrille 
she lived with her single daughter in a very small way and was 
considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady 
under such untoward circumstances can excite her daughter enjoyed 
a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young 
handsome rich nor married miss bates stood in the very worst 
predicament in the world for having much of the public favour 
and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself 
or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect 
she had never boasted either beauty or cleverness her youth 
had passed without distinction and her middle of life was devoted 
to the care of a failing mother and the endeavour to make a small 
income go as far as possible and yet she was a happy woman 
and a woman whom no one named without good will it was her own 
universal good will and contented temper which worked such wonders 
she loved every body was interested in every body s happiness 
quicksighted to every body s merits thought herself a most fortunate 
creature and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother 
and so many good neighbours and friends and a home that wanted 
for nothing the simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature 
her contented and grateful spirit were a recommendation to every body 
and a mine of felicity to herself she was a great talker upon 
little matters which exactly suited mr woodhouse full of trivial 
communications and harmless gossip 
mrs goddard was the mistress of a school not of a seminary 
or an establishment or any thing which professed in long sentences of 
refined nonsense to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality 
upon new principles and new systems and where young ladies for 
enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity but 
a real honest old fashioned boarding school where a reasonable 
quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price 
and where girls might be sent to be out of the way and scramble 
themselves into a little education without any danger of coming 
back prodigies mrs goddard s school was in high repute and 
very deservedly for highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy 
spot she had an ample house and garden gave the children plenty 
of wholesome food let them run about a great deal in the summer 
and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands 
it was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked 
after her to church she was a plain motherly kind of woman 
who had worked hard in her youth and now thought herself entitled 
to the occasional holiday of a tea visit and having formerly 
owed much to mr woodhouse s kindness felt his particular claim 
on her to leave her neat parlour hung round with fancy work 
whenever she could and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside 
these were the ladies whom emma found herself very frequently 
able to collect and happy was she for her father s sake 
in the power though as far as she was herself concerned 
it was no remedy for the absence of mrs weston she was delighted 
to see her father look comfortable and very much pleased with 
herself for contriving things so well but the quiet prosings 
of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent 
was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated 
as she sat one morning looking forward to exactly such a close 
of the present day a note was brought from mrs goddard requesting 
in most respectful terms to be allowed to bring miss smith with her 
a most welcome request for miss smith was a girl of seventeen 
whom emma knew very well by sight and had long felt an interest in 
on account of her beauty a very gracious invitation was returned 
and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion 
harriet smith was the natural daughter of somebody somebody had 
placed her several years back at mrs goddard s school 
and somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar 
to that of parlour boarder this was all that was generally known 
of her history she had no visible friends but what had been 
acquired at highbury and was now just returned from a long visit 
in the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with her 
she was a very pretty girl and her beauty happened to be of a sort 
which emma particularly admired she was short plump and fair 
with a fine bloom blue eyes light hair regular features 
and a look of great sweetness and before the end of the evening 
emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person and quite 
determined to continue the acquaintance 
she was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in miss smith s 
conversation but she found her altogether very engaging not 
inconveniently shy not unwilling to talk and yet so far from pushing 
shewing so proper and becoming a deference seeming so pleasantly 
grateful for being admitted to hartfield and so artlessly 
impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style 
to what she had been used to that she must have good sense 
and deserve encouragement encouragement should be given 
those soft blue eyes and all those natural graces should not be 
wasted on the inferior society of highbury and its connexions 
the acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her 
the friends from whom she had just parted though very good sort 
of people must be doing her harm they were a family of the name 
of martin whom emma well knew by character as renting a large farm 
of mr knightley and residing in the parish of donwell very creditably 
she believed she knew mr knightley thought highly of them but they 
must be coarse and unpolished and very unfit to be the intimates 
of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance 
to be quite perfect she would notice her she would improve her 
she would detach her from her bad acquaintance and introduce her 
into good society she would form her opinions and her manners 
it would be an interesting and certainly a very kind undertaking 
highly becoming her own situation in life her leisure and powers 
she was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes in talking 
and listening and forming all these schemes in the in betweens that 
the evening flew away at a very unusual rate and the supper table 
which always closed such parties and for which she had been 
used to sit and watch the due time was all set out and ready 
and moved forwards to the fire before she was aware with an 
alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never 
indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively 
with the real good will of a mind delighted with its own ideas 
did she then do all the honours of the meal and help and recommend 
the minced chicken and scalloped oysters with an urgency which she 
knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests 
upon such occasions poor mr woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare 
he loved to have the cloth laid because it had been the fashion 
of his youth but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome 
made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it and while his 
hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing 
his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat 
such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that 
he could with thorough self approbation recommend though he 
might constrain himself while the ladies were comfortably clearing 
the nicer things to say 
mrs bates let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs 
an egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome serle understands boiling 
an egg better than any body i would not recommend an egg boiled 
by any body else but you need not be afraid they are very small 
you see one of our small eggs will not hurt you miss bates 
let emma help you to a little bit of tart a very little bit 
ours are all apple tarts you need not be afraid of unwholesome 
preserves here i do not advise the custard mrs goddard what say 
you to half a glass of wine a small half glass put into a tumbler 
of water i do not think it could disagree with you 
emma allowed her father to talk but supplied her visitors in 
a much more satisfactory style and on the present evening had 
particular pleasure in sending them away happy the happiness 
of miss smith was quite equal to her intentions miss woodhouse 
was so great a personage in highbury that the prospect of the 
introduction had given as much panic as pleasure but the humble 
grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings 
delighted with the affability with which miss woodhouse had treated 
her all the evening and actually shaken hands with her at last 
chapter iv 
harriet smith s intimacy at hartfield was soon a settled thing 
quick and decided in her ways emma lost no time in inviting encouraging 
and telling her to come very often and as their acquaintance increased 
so did their satisfaction in each other as a walking companion 
emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her 
in that respect mrs weston s loss had been important her father 
never went beyond the shrubbery where two divisions of the ground 
sufficed him for his long walk or his short as the year varied 
and since mrs weston s marriage her exercise had been too much confined 
she had ventured once alone to randalls but it was not pleasant 
and a harriet smith therefore one whom she could summon at any 
time to a walk would be a valuable addition to her privileges 
but in every respect as she saw more of her she approved her 
and was confirmed in all her kind designs 
harriet certainly was not clever but she had a sweet docile 
grateful disposition was totally free from conceit and only desiring 
to be guided by any one she looked up to her early attachment 
to herself was very amiable and her inclination for good company 
and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever shewed that 
there was no want of taste though strength of understanding must 
not be expected altogether she was quite convinced of harriet 
smith s being exactly the young friend she wanted exactly the 
something which her home required such a friend as mrs weston 
was out of the question two such could never be granted 
two such she did not want it was quite a different sort of thing 
a sentiment distinct and independent mrs weston was the object 
of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem 
harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful 
for mrs weston there was nothing to be done for harriet every thing 
her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who 
were the parents but harriet could not tell she was ready to tell 
every thing in her power but on this subject questions were vain 
emma was obliged to fancy what she liked but she could never 
believe that in the same situation she should not have discovered 
the truth harriet had no penetration she had been satisfied 
to hear and believe just what mrs goddard chose to tell her 
and looked no farther 
mrs goddard and the teachers and the girls and the affairs of the 
school in general formed naturally a great part of the conversation and 
but for her acquaintance with the martins of abbey mill farm 
it must have been the whole but the martins occupied her thoughts 
a good deal she had spent two very happy months with them 
and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit and describe 
the many comforts and wonders of the place emma encouraged her 
talkativeness amused by such a picture of another set of beings 
and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much 
exultation of mrs martin s having two parlours two very good parlours 
indeed one of them quite as large as mrs goddard s drawing room 
and of her having an upper maid who had lived five and twenty years 
with her and of their having eight cows two of them alderneys 
and one a little welch cow a very pretty little welch cow indeed 
and of mrs martin s saying as she was so fond of it it should be 
called her cow and of their having a very handsome summer house 
in their garden where some day next year they were all to drink 
tea a very handsome summer house large enough to hold a dozen people 
for some time she was amused without thinking beyond the immediate because 
but as she came to understand the family better other feelings arose 
she had taken up a wrong idea fancying it was a mother and daughter 
a son and son s wife who all lived together but when it appeared 
that the mr martin who bore a part in the narrative and was always 
mentioned with approbation for his great good nature in doing something 
or other was a single man that there was no young mrs martin 
no wife in the case she did suspect danger to her poor little 
friend from all this hospitality and kindness and that if she 
were not taken care of she might be required to sink herself forever 
with this inspiriting notion her questions increased in number 
and meaning and she particularly led harriet to talk more of mr martin 
and there was evidently no dislike to it harriet was very ready 
to speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry 
evening games and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good humoured 
and obliging he had gone three miles round one day in order to bring 
her some walnuts because she had said how fond she was of them 
and in every thing else he was so very obliging he had his 
shepherd s son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her 
she was very fond of singing he could sing a little himself 
she believed he was very clever and understood every thing 
he had a very fine flock and while she was with them 
he had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country 
she believed every body spoke well of him his mother and sisters 
were very fond of him mrs martin had told her one day and there 
was a blush as she said it that it was impossible for any body 
to be a better son and therefore she was sure whenever he married 
he would make a good husband not that she wanted him to marry 
she was in no hurry at all 
well done mrs martin thought emma you know what you are about 
and when she had come away mrs martin was so very kind as to send 
mrs goddard a beautiful goose the finest goose mrs goddard had 
ever seen mrs goddard had dressed it on a sunday and asked all 
the three teachers miss nash and miss prince and miss richardson 
to sup with her 
mr martin i suppose is not a man of information beyond the line 
of his own business he does not read 
oh yes that is no i do not know but i believe he has 
read a good deal but not what you would think any thing of 
he reads the agricultural reports and some other books that lay 
in one of the window seats but he reads all them to himself 
but sometimes of an evening before we went to cards he would read 
something aloud out of the elegant extracts very entertaining 
and i know he has read the vicar of wakefield he never read the 
romance of the forest nor the children of the abbey he had never 
heard of such books before i mentioned them but he is determined 
to get them now as soon as ever he can 
the next question was 
what sort of looking man is mr martin 
oh not handsome not at all handsome i thought him very plain 
at first but i do not think him so plain now one does not you know 
after a time but did you never see him he is in highbury every 
now and then and he is sure to ride through every week in his way 
to kingston he has passed you very often 
that may be and i may have seen him fifty times but without 
having any idea of his name a young farmer whether on horseback 
or on foot is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity 
the yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom i feel i 
can have nothing to do a degree or two lower and a creditable 
appearance might interest me i might hope to be useful to their 
families in some way or other but a farmer can need none of my help 
and is therefore in one sense as much above my notice as in every 
other he is below it 
to be sure oh yes it is not likely you should ever have 
observed him but he knows you very well indeed i mean by sight 
i have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man 
i know indeed that he is so and as such wish him well 
what do you imagine his age to be 
he was four and twenty the th of last june and my birthday is 
the rd just a fortnight and a day s difference which is very odd 
only four and twenty that is too young to settle his mother is 
perfectly right not to be in a hurry they seem very comfortable 
as they are and if she were to take any pains to marry him 
she would probably repent it six years hence if he could meet 
with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own 
with a little money it might be very desirable 
six years hence dear miss woodhouse he would be thirty years old 
well and that is as early as most men can afford to marry 
who are not born to an independence mr martin i imagine 
has his fortune entirely to make cannot be at all beforehand with 
the world whatever money he might come into when his father died 
whatever his share of the family property it is i dare say 
all afloat all employed in his stock and so forth and though 
with diligence and good luck he may be rich in time it is next to 
impossible that he should have realised any thing yet 
to be sure so it is but they live very comfortably 
they have no indoors man else they do not want for any thing 
and mrs martin talks of taking a boy another year 
i wish you may not get into a scrape harriet whenever he does 
marry i mean as to being acquainted with his wife for though 
his sisters from a superior education are not to be altogether 
objected to it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit 
for you to notice the misfortune of your birth ought to make you 
particularly careful as to your associates there can be no doubt 
of your being a gentleman s daughter and you must support your 
claim to that station by every thing within your own power or there 
will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you 
yes to be sure i suppose there are but while i visit 
at hartfield and you are so kind to me miss woodhouse 
i am not afraid of what any body can do 
you understand the force of influence pretty well harriet but i 
would have you so firmly established in good society as to be 
independent even of hartfield and miss woodhouse i want to see you 
permanently well connected and to that end it will be advisable 
to have as few odd acquaintance as may be and therefore i say 
that if you should still be in this country when mr martin marries 
i wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters 
to be acquainted with the wife who will probably be some mere 
farmer s daughter without education 
to be sure yes not that i think mr martin would ever marry any body 
but what had had some education and been very well brought up 
however i do not mean to set up my opinion against your s and i 
am sure i shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife i shall 
always have a great regard for the miss martins especially elizabeth 
and should be very sorry to give them up for they are quite as well 
educated as me but if he marries a very ignorant vulgar woman 
certainly i had better not visit her if i can help it 
emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech 
and saw no alarming symptoms of love the young man had been 
the first admirer but she trusted there was no other hold 
and that there would be no serious difficulty on harriet s side 
to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own 
they met mr martin the very next day as they were walking on the 
donwell road he was on foot and after looking very respectfully 
at her looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion 
emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey 
and walking a few yards forward while they talked together soon made 
her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with mr robert martin 
his appearance was very neat and he looked like a sensible young man 
but his person had no other advantage and when he came to be 
contrasted with gentlemen she thought he must lose all the ground 
he had gained in harriet s inclination harriet was not insensible 
of manner she had voluntarily noticed her father s gentleness 
with admiration as well as wonder mr martin looked as if he 
did not know what manner was 
they remained but a few minutes together as miss woodhouse must 
not be kept waiting and harriet then came running to her with a 
smiling face and in a flutter of spirits which miss woodhouse 
hoped very soon to compose 
only think of our happening to meet him how very odd it was 
quite a chance he said that he had not gone round by randalls 
he did not think we ever walked this road he thought we walked 
towards randalls most days he has not been able to get the 
romance of the forest yet he was so busy the last time he was 
at kingston that he quite forgot it but he goes again to morrow 
so very odd we should happen to meet well miss woodhouse is he 
like what you expected what do you think of him do you think him 
so very plain 
he is very plain undoubtedly remarkably plain but that is 
nothing compared with his entire want of gentility i had no 
right to expect much and i did not expect much but i had no 
idea that he could be so very clownish so totally without air 
i had imagined him i confess a degree or two nearer gentility 
to be sure said harriet in a mortified voice he is not 
so genteel as real gentlemen 
i think harriet since your acquaintance with us you have been 
repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen 
that you must yourself be struck with the difference in mr martin 
at hartfield you have had very good specimens of well educated 
well bred men i should be surprized if after seeing them 
you could be in company with mr martin again without perceiving 
him to be a very inferior creature and rather wondering at 
yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before 
do not you begin to feel that now were not you struck i am sure 
you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner 
and the uncouthness of a voice which i heard to be wholly unmodulated 
as i stood here 
certainly he is not like mr knightley he has not such a fine 
air and way of walking as mr knightley i see the difference 
plain enough but mr knightley is so very fine a man 
mr knightley s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair 
to compare mr martin with him you might not see one in a hundred 
with gentleman so plainly written as in mr knightley but he is 
not the only gentleman you have been lately used to what say you 
to mr weston and mr elton compare mr martin with either of them 
compare their manner of carrying themselves of walking of speaking 
of being silent you must see the difference 
oh yes there is a great difference but mr weston is almost 
an old man mr weston must be between forty and fifty 
which makes his good manners the more valuable the older a 
person grows harriet the more important it is that their manners 
should not be bad the more glaring and disgusting any loudness 
or coarseness or awkwardness becomes what is passable in youth 
is detestable in later age mr martin is now awkward and abrupt 
what will he be at mr weston s time of life 
there is no saying indeed replied harriet rather solemnly 
but there may be pretty good guessing he will be a completely gross 
vulgar farmer totally inattentive to appearances and thinking 
of nothing but profit and loss 
will he indeed that will be very bad 
how much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the 
circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended 
he was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing 
else which is just as it should be for a thriving man what has 
he to do with books and i have no doubt that he will thrive 
and be a very rich man in time and his being illiterate and coarse 
need not disturb us 
i wonder he did not remember the book was all harriet s answer 
and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which emma thought might 
be safely left to itself she therefore said no more for some time 
her next beginning was 
in one respect perhaps mr elton s manners are superior 
to mr knightley s or mr weston s they have more gentleness 
they might be more safely held up as a pattern there is an openness 
a quickness almost a bluntness in mr weston which every body 
likes in him because there is so much good humour with it but 
that would not do to be copied neither would mr knightley s 
downright decided commanding sort of manner though it suits 
him very well his figure and look and situation in life seem 
to allow it but if any young man were to set about copying him 
he would not be sufferable on the contrary i think a young man 
might be very safely recommended to take mr elton as a model 
mr elton is good humoured cheerful obliging and gentle 
he seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late i do not 
know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either 
of us harriet by additional softness but it strikes me that his 
manners are softer than they used to be if he means any thing 
it must be to please you did not i tell you what he said of you 
the other day 
she then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn 
from mr elton and now did full justice to and harriet blushed 
and smiled and said she had always thought mr elton very agreeable 
mr elton was the very person fixed on by emma for driving 
the young farmer out of harriet s head she thought it would 
be an excellent match and only too palpably desirable natural 
and probable for her to have much merit in planning it 
she feared it was what every body else must think of and predict 
it was not likely however that any body should have equalled 
her in the date of the plan as it had entered her brain during 
the very first evening of harriet s coming to hartfield the longer 
she considered it the greater was her sense of its expediency 
mr elton s situation was most suitable quite the gentleman himself 
and without low connexions at the same time not of any family 
that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of harriet he had a 
comfortable home for her and emma imagined a very sufficient income 
for though the vicarage of highbury was not large he was known 
to have some independent property and she thought very highly 
of him as a good humoured well meaning respectable young man 
without any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world 
she had already satisfied herself that he thought harriet a beautiful 
girl which she trusted with such frequent meetings at hartfield 
was foundation enough on his side and on harriet s there could be 
little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all 
the usual weight and efficacy and he was really a very pleasing 
young man a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like 
he was reckoned very handsome his person much admired in general 
though not by her there being a want of elegance of feature which 
she could not dispense with but the girl who could be gratified 
by a robert martin s riding about the country to get walnuts 
for her might very well be conquered by mr elton s admiration 
chapter v 
i do not know what your opinion may be mrs weston said mr knightley of 
this great intimacy between emma and harriet smith but i think it a bad thing 
a bad thing do you really think it a bad thing why so 
i think they will neither of them do the other any good 
you surprize me emma must do harriet good and by supplying her 
with a new object of interest harriet may be said to do emma good 
i have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure 
how very differently we feel not think they will do each other any 
good this will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels 
about emma mr knightley 
perhaps you think i am come on purpose to quarrel with you 
knowing weston to be out and that you must still fight your own battle 
mr weston would undoubtedly support me if he were here 
for he thinks exactly as i do on the subject we were speaking 
of it only yesterday and agreeing how fortunate it was for emma 
that there should be such a girl in highbury for her to associate with 
mr knightley i shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case 
you are so much used to live alone that you do not know the value 
of a companion and perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort 
a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex after being used 
to it all her life i can imagine your objection to harriet smith 
she is not the superior young woman which emma s friend ought to be 
but on the other hand as emma wants to see her better informed 
it will be an inducement to her to read more herself they will 
read together she means it i know 
emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve 
years old i have seen a great many lists of her drawing up at 
various times of books that she meant to read regularly through and 
very good lists they were very well chosen and very neatly 
arranged sometimes alphabetically and sometimes by some other rule 
the list she drew up when only fourteen i remember thinking it 
did her judgment so much credit that i preserved it some time 
and i dare say she may have made out a very good list now but i 
have done with expecting any course of steady reading from emma 
she will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience 
and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding where miss taylor 
failed to stimulate i may safely affirm that harriet smith will do 
nothing you never could persuade her to read half so much as you 
wished you know you could not 
i dare say replied mrs weston smiling that i thought 
so then but since we have parted i can never remember emma s 
omitting to do any thing i wished 
there is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as that said 
mr knightley feelingly and for a moment or two he had done but i 
he soon added who have had no such charm thrown over my senses 
must still see hear and remember emma is spoiled by being the 
cleverest of her family at ten years old she had the misfortune of 
being able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen 
she was always quick and assured isabella slow and diffident 
and ever since she was twelve emma has been mistress of the house 
and of you all in her mother she lost the only person able to cope 
with her she inherits her mother s talents and must have been 
under subjection to her 
i should have been sorry mr knightley to be dependent on 
your recommendation had i quitted mr woodhouse s family and wanted 
another situation i do not think you would have spoken a good word for 
me to any body i am sure you always thought me unfit for the office i held 
yes said he smiling you are better placed here very fit 
for a wife but not at all for a governess but you were preparing 
yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at hartfield 
you might not give emma such a complete education as your powers would 
seem to promise but you were receiving a very good education from her 
on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will 
and doing as you were bid and if weston had asked me to recommend 
him a wife i should certainly have named miss taylor 
thank you there will be very little merit in making a good wife 
to such a man as mr weston 
why to own the truth i am afraid you are rather thrown away 
and that with every disposition to bear there will be nothing 
to be borne we will not despair however weston may grow cross 
from the wantonness of comfort or his son may plague him 
i hope not that it is not likely no mr knightley do not 
foretell vexation from that quarter 
not i indeed i only name possibilities i do not pretend to emma s 
genius for foretelling and guessing i hope with all my heart 
the young man may be a weston in merit and a churchill in fortune but 
harriet smith i have not half done about harriet smith i think 
her the very worst sort of companion that emma could possibly have 
she knows nothing herself and looks upon emma as knowing every thing 
she is a flatterer in all her ways and so much the worse 
because undesigned her ignorance is hourly flattery how can 
emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself while harriet 
is presenting such a delightful inferiority and as for harriet 
i will venture to say that she cannot gain by the acquaintance 
hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places 
she belongs to she will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable 
with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home 
i am much mistaken if emma s doctrines give any strength of mind 
or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties 
of her situation in life they only give a little polish 
i either depend more upon emma s good sense than you do or am more 
anxious for her present comfort for i cannot lament the acquaintance 
how well she looked last night 
oh you would rather talk of her person than her mind would you 
very well i shall not attempt to deny emma s being pretty 
pretty say beautiful rather can you imagine any thing nearer 
perfect beauty than emma altogether face and figure 
i do not know what i could imagine but i confess that i have 
seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers 
but i am a partial old friend 
such an eye the true hazle eye and so brilliant regular features 
open countenance with a complexion oh what a bloom of full health 
and such a pretty height and size such a firm and upright figure 
there is health not merely in her bloom but in her air her head 
her glance one hears sometimes of a child being the picture 
of health now emma always gives me the idea of being the complete 
picture of grown up health she is loveliness itself mr knightley 
is not she 
i have not a fault to find with her person he replied 
i think her all you describe i love to look at her and i 
will add this praise that i do not think her personally vain 
considering how very handsome she is she appears to be little 
occupied with it her vanity lies another way mrs weston i am 
not to be talked out of my dislike of harriet smith or my dread 
of its doing them both harm 
and i mr knightley am equally stout in my confidence of its 
not doing them any harm with all dear emma s little faults 
she is an excellent creature where shall we see a better daughter 
or a kinder sister or a truer friend no no she has qualities 
which may be trusted she will never lead any one really wrong 
she will make no lasting blunder where emma errs once she is in the 
right a hundred times 
very well i will not plague you any more emma shall be an angel 
and i will keep my spleen to myself till christmas brings john 
and isabella john loves emma with a reasonable and therefore 
not a blind affection and isabella always thinks as he does 
except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children 
i am sure of having their opinions with me 
i know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind 
but excuse me mr knightley if i take the liberty i consider myself 
you know as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that emma s 
mother might have had the liberty of hinting that i do not think 
any possible good can arise from harriet smith s intimacy being made 
a matter of much discussion among you pray excuse me but supposing 
any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy 
it cannot be expected that emma accountable to nobody but her father 
who perfectly approves the acquaintance should put an end to it 
so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself it has been so 
many years my province to give advice that you cannot be surprized 
mr knightley at this little remains of office 
not at all cried he i am much obliged to you for it 
it is very good advice and it shall have a better fate than your 
advice has often found for it shall be attended to 
mrs john knightley is easily alarmed and might be made unhappy 
about her sister 
be satisfied said he i will not raise any outcry i will keep 
my ill humour to myself i have a very sincere interest in emma 
isabella does not seem more my sister has never excited a 
greater interest perhaps hardly so great there is an anxiety 
a curiosity in what one feels for emma i wonder what will become 
of her 
so do i said mrs weston gently very much 
she always declares she will never marry which of course 
means just nothing at all but i have no idea that she has yet 
ever seen a man she cared for it would not be a bad thing for her 
to be very much in love with a proper object i should like to see 
emma in love and in some doubt of a return it would do her good 
but there is nobody hereabouts to attach her and she goes so seldom 
from home 
there does indeed seem as little to tempt her to break 
her resolution at present said mrs weston as can well be 
and while she is so happy at hartfield i cannot wish her to be 
forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties 
on poor mr woodhouse s account i do not recommend matrimony 
at present to emma though i mean no slight to the state i assure you 
part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of 
her own and mr weston s on the subject as much as possible 
there were wishes at randalls respecting emma s destiny but it 
was not desirable to have them suspected and the quiet transition 
which mr knightley soon afterwards made to what does weston 
think of the weather shall we have rain convinced her that he 
had nothing more to say or surmise about hartfield 
chapter vi 
emma could not feel a doubt of having given harriet s fancy 
a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity 
to a very good purpose for she found her decidedly more sensible 
than before of mr elton s being a remarkably handsome man with most 
agreeable manners and as she had no hesitation in following up 
the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints she was soon 
pretty confident of creating as much liking on harriet s side 
as there could be any occasion for she was quite convinced 
of mr elton s being in the fairest way of falling in love 
if not in love already she had no scruple with regard to him 
he talked of harriet and praised her so warmly that she could 
not suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add 
his perception of the striking improvement of harriet s manner 
since her introduction at hartfield was not one of the least 
agreeable proofs of his growing attachment 
you have given miss smith all that she required said he 
you have made her graceful and easy she was a beautiful creature 
when she came to you but in my opinion the attractions you have 
added are infinitely superior to what she received from nature 
i am glad you think i have been useful to her but harriet 
only wanted drawing out and receiving a few very few hints 
she had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness 
in herself i have done very little 
if it were admissible to contradict a lady said the gallant 
mr elton 
i have perhaps given her a little more decision of character 
have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her 
way before 
exactly so that is what principally strikes me so much superadded 
decision of character skilful has been the hand 
great has been the pleasure i am sure i never met with 
a disposition more truly amiable 
i have no doubt of it and it was spoken with a sort 
of sighing animation which had a vast deal of the lover 
she was not less pleased another day with the manner 
in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers to have harriet s picture 
did you ever have your likeness taken harriet said she did 
you ever sit for your picture 
harriet was on the point of leaving the room and only stopt to say 
with a very interesting naivete 
oh dear no never 
no sooner was she out of sight than emma exclaimed 
what an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be i would 
give any money for it i almost long to attempt her likeness myself 
you do not know it i dare say but two or three years ago i had 
a great passion for taking likenesses and attempted several of 
my friends and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general 
but from one because or another i gave it up in disgust 
but really i could almost venture if harriet would sit to me 
it would be such a delight to have her picture 
let me entreat you cried mr elton it would indeed be a delight 
let me entreat you miss woodhouse to exercise so charming a 
talent in favour of your friend i know what your drawings are 
how could you suppose me ignorant is not this room rich in 
specimens of your landscapes and flowers and has not mrs weston 
some inimitable figure pieces in her drawing room at randalls 
yes good man thought emma but what has all that to do with taking 
likenesses you know nothing of drawing do not pretend to be 
in raptures about mine keep your raptures for harriet s face 
well if you give me such kind encouragement mr elton i believe 
i shall try what i can do harriet s features are very delicate 
which makes a likeness difficult and yet there is a peculiarity 
in the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought 
to catch 
exactly so the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth i 
have not a doubt of your success pray pray attempt it 
as you will do it it will indeed to use your own words 
be an exquisite possession 
but i am afraid mr elton harriet will not like to sit 
she thinks so little of her own beauty did not you observe her 
manner of answering me how completely it meant why should my 
picture be drawn 
oh yes i observed it i assure you it was not lost on me 
but still i cannot imagine she would not be persuaded 
harriet was soon back again and the proposal almost immediately made 
and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest 
pressing of both the others emma wished to go to work directly 
and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts 
at portraits for not one of them had ever been finished that they 
might decide together on the best size for harriet her many 
beginnings were displayed miniatures half lengths whole lengths 
pencil crayon and water colours had been all tried in turn 
she had always wanted to do every thing and had made more progress 
both in drawing and music than many might have done with so little 
labour as she would ever submit to she played and sang and drew 
in almost every style but steadiness had always been wanting 
and in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she 
would have been glad to command and ought not to have failed of 
she was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an artist 
or a musician but she was not unwilling to have others deceived 
or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher 
than it deserved 
there was merit in every drawing in the least finished perhaps the most 
her style was spirited but had there been much less or had there 
been ten times more the delight and admiration of her two companions 
would have been the same they were both in ecstasies a likeness 
pleases every body and miss woodhouse s performances must be capital 
no great variety of faces for you said emma i had only my 
own family to study from there is my father another of my 
father but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous 
that i could only take him by stealth neither of them very 
like therefore mrs weston again and again and again you see 
dear mrs weston always my kindest friend on every occasion 
she would sit whenever i asked her there is my sister and really 
quite her own little elegant figure and the face not unlike 
i should have made a good likeness of her if she would have 
sat longer but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four 
children that she would not be quiet then here come all my 
attempts at three of those four children there they are 
henry and john and bella from one end of the sheet to the other 
and any one of them might do for any one of the rest she was so 
eager to have them drawn that i could not refuse but there is no 
making children of three or four years old stand still you know 
nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them beyond the 
air and complexion unless they are coarser featured than any 
of mama s children ever were here is my sketch of the fourth 
who was a baby i took him as he was sleeping on the sofa and it 
is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see 
he had nestled down his head most conveniently that is very like 
i am rather proud of little george the corner of the sofa is very good 
then here is my last unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman 
in small size whole length my last and my best my brother 
mr john knightley this did not want much of being finished when i 
put it away in a pet and vowed i would never take another likeness 
i could not help being provoked for after all my pains and when i 
had really made a very good likeness of it mrs weston and i 
were quite agreed in thinking it very like only too handsome too 
flattering but that was a fault on the right side after 
all this came poor dear isabella s cold approbation of yes 
it was a little like but to be sure it did not do him justice 
we had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all 
it was made a great favour of and altogether it was more than i 
could bear and so i never would finish it to have it apologised 
over as an unfavourable likeness to every morning visitor in 
brunswick square and as i said i did then forswear ever drawing 
any body again but for harriet s sake or rather for my own 
and as there are no husbands and wives in the case at present 
i will break my resolution now 
mr elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea 
and was repeating no husbands and wives in the case at present 
indeed as you observe exactly so no husbands and wives 
with so interesting a consciousness that emma began to consider 
whether she had not better leave them together at once but as she 
wanted to be drawing the declaration must wait a little longer 
she had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait 
it was to be a whole length in water colours like mr john 
knightley s and was destined if she could please herself 
to hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece 
the sitting began and harriet smiling and blushing and afraid 
of not keeping her attitude and countenance presented a very sweet 
mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist 
but there was no doing any thing with mr elton fidgeting behind 
her and watching every touch she gave him credit for stationing 
himself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence 
but was really obliged to put an end to it and request him to 
place himself elsewhere it then occurred to her to employ him 
in reading 
if he would be so good as to read to them it would be a kindness 
indeed it would amuse away the difficulties of her part and lessen 
the irksomeness of miss smith s 
mr elton was only too happy harriet listened and emma drew 
in peace she must allow him to be still frequently coming to look 
any thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover 
and he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil 
to jump up and see the progress and be charmed there was no 
being displeased with such an encourager for his admiration 
made him discern a likeness almost before it was possible 
she could not respect his eye but his love and his complaisance 
were unexceptionable 
the sitting was altogether very satisfactory she was quite 
enough pleased with the first day s sketch to wish to go on 
there was no want of likeness she had been fortunate in the attitude 
and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure 
to give a little more height and considerably more elegance she had 
great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last 
and of its filling its destined place with credit to them both a 
standing memorial of the beauty of one the skill of the other 
and the friendship of both with as many other agreeable associations 
as mr elton s very promising attachment was likely to add 
harriet was to sit again the next day and mr elton just as he ought 
entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again 
by all means we shall be most happy to consider you as one 
of the party 
the same civilities and courtesies the same success and satisfaction 
took place on the morrow and accompanied the whole progress 
of the picture which was rapid and happy every body who saw it 
was pleased but mr elton was in continual raptures and defended 
it through every criticism 
miss woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she 
wanted observed mrs weston to him not in the least suspecting 
that she was addressing a lover the expression of the eye is 
most correct but miss smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes 
it is the fault of her face that she has them not 
do you think so replied he i cannot agree with you 
it appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature 
i never saw such a likeness in my life we must allow for the effect 
of shade you know 
you have made her too tall emma said mr knightley 
emma knew that she had but would not own it and mr elton warmly added 
oh no certainly not too tall not in the least too tall consider 
she is sitting down which naturally presents a different which 
in short gives exactly the idea and the proportions must 
be preserved you know proportions fore shortening oh no it 
gives one exactly the idea of such a height as miss smith s exactly so indeed 
it is very pretty said mr woodhouse so prettily done just 
as your drawings always are my dear i do not know any body who draws 
so well as you do the only thing i do not thoroughly like is 
that she seems to be sitting out of doors with only a little shawl 
over her shoulders and it makes one think she must catch cold 
but my dear papa it is supposed to be summer a warm day in summer 
look at the tree 
but it is never safe to sit out of doors my dear 
you sir may say any thing cried mr elton but i must confess 
that i regard it as a most happy thought the placing of miss 
smith out of doors and the tree is touched with such inimitable 
spirit any other situation would have been much less in character 
the naivete of miss smith s manners and altogether oh it is 
most admirable i cannot keep my eyes from it i never saw such 
a likeness 
the next thing wanted was to get the picture framed and here were a 
few difficulties it must be done directly it must be done in london 
the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste 
could be depended on and isabella the usual doer of all commissions 
must not be applied to because it was december and mr woodhouse 
could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs 
of december but no sooner was the distress known to mr elton 
than it was removed his gallantry was always on the alert 
might he be trusted with the commission what infinite pleasure 
should he have in executing it he could ride to london at any time 
it was impossible to say how much he should be gratified by being 
employed on such an errand 
he was too good she could not endure the thought she would 
not give him such a troublesome office for the world brought 
on the desired repetition of entreaties and assurances and 
a very few minutes settled the business 
mr elton was to take the drawing to london chuse the frame 
and give the directions and emma thought she could so pack it 
as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him while he 
seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough 
what a precious deposit said he with a tender sigh as he 
received it 
this man is almost too gallant to be in love thought emma 
i should say so but that i suppose there may be a hundred different 
ways of being in love he is an excellent young man and will suit 
harriet exactly it will be an exactly so as he says himself 
but he does sigh and languish and study for compliments rather more 
than i could endure as a principal i come in for a pretty good 
share as a second but it is his gratitude on harriet s account 
chapter vii 
the very day of mr elton s going to london produced a fresh occasion 
for emma s services towards her friend harriet had been at hartfield 
as usual soon after breakfast and after a time had gone home 
to return again to dinner she returned and sooner than had been 
talked of and with an agitated hurried look announcing something 
extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell 
half a minute brought it all out she had heard as soon as she got 
back to mrs goddard s that mr martin had been there an hour before 
and finding she was not at home nor particularly expected had left 
a little parcel for her from one of his sisters and gone away 
and on opening this parcel she had actually found besides the two 
songs which she had lent elizabeth to copy a letter to herself 
and this letter was from him from mr martin and contained a direct 
proposal of marriage who could have thought it she was so surprized 
she did not know what to do yes quite a proposal of marriage 
and a very good letter at least she thought so and he wrote 
as if he really loved her very much but she did not know and so 
she was come as fast as she could to ask miss woodhouse what she 
should do emma was half ashamed of her friend for seeming so 
pleased and so doubtful 
upon my word she cried the young man is determined not to lose 
any thing for want of asking he will connect himself well if he can 
will you read the letter cried harriet pray do i would rather 
you would 
emma was not sorry to be pressed she read and was surprized 
the style of the letter was much above her expectation 
there were not merely no grammatical errors but as a composition it 
would not have disgraced a gentleman the language though plain 
was strong and unaffected and the sentiments it conveyed very much 
to the credit of the writer it was short but expressed good sense 
warm attachment liberality propriety even delicacy of feeling 
she paused over it while harriet stood anxiously watching for 
her opinion with a well well and was at last forced to add 
is it a good letter or is it too short 
yes indeed a very good letter replied emma rather slowly so 
good a letter harriet that every thing considered i think one of 
his sisters must have helped him i can hardly imagine the young 
man whom i saw talking with you the other day could express himself 
so well if left quite to his own powers and yet it is not the 
style of a woman no certainly it is too strong and concise 
not diffuse enough for a woman no doubt he is a sensible man 
and i suppose may have a natural talent for thinks strongly and 
clearly and when he takes a pen in hand his thoughts naturally find 
proper words it is so with some men yes i understand the sort 
of mind vigorous decided with sentiments to a certain point 
not coarse a better written letter harriet returning it 
than i had expected 
well said the still waiting harriet well and and what 
shall i do 
what shall you do in what respect do you mean with regard 
to this letter 
yes 
but what are you in doubt of you must answer it of course and speedily 
yes but what shall i say dear miss woodhouse do advise me 
oh no no the letter had much better be all your own you will 
express yourself very properly i am sure there is no danger of your 
not being intelligible which is the first thing your meaning must 
be unequivocal no doubts or demurs and such expressions of gratitude 
and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires 
will present themselves unbidden to your mind i am persuaded 
you need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow 
for his disappointment 
you think i ought to refuse him then said harriet looking down 
ought to refuse him my dear harriet what do you mean are you 
in any doubt as to that i thought but i beg your pardon perhaps i 
have been under a mistake i certainly have been misunderstanding 
you if you feel in doubt as to the purport of your answer 
i had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it 
harriet was silent with a little reserve of manner emma continued 
you mean to return a favourable answer i collect 
no i do not that is i do not mean what shall i do what would 
you advise me to do pray dear miss woodhouse tell me what i 
ought to do 
i shall not give you any advice harriet i will have nothing to 
do with it this is a point which you must settle with your feelings 
i had no notion that he liked me so very much said harriet 
contemplating the letter for a little while emma persevered 
in her silence but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery 
of that letter might be too powerful she thought it best to say 
i lay it down as a general rule harriet that if a woman doubts 
as to whether she should accept a man or not she certainly ought 
to refuse him if she can hesitate as to yes she ought to say 
no directly it is not a state to be safely entered into 
with doubtful feelings with half a heart i thought it my duty 
as a friend and older than yourself to say thus much to you 
but do not imagine that i want to influence you 
oh no i am sure you are a great deal too kind to but if you 
would just advise me what i had best do no no i do not mean 
that as you say one s mind ought to be quite made up one should 
not be hesitating it is a very serious thing it will be safer 
to say no perhaps do you think i had better say no 
not for the world said emma smiling graciously would i advise 
you either way you must be the best judge of your own happiness 
if you prefer mr martin to every other person if you think him 
the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with why should 
you hesitate you blush harriet does any body else occur to you 
at this moment under such a definition harriet harriet do not 
deceive yourself do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion 
at this moment whom are you thinking of 
the symptoms were favourable instead of answering harriet turned 
away confused and stood thoughtfully by the fire and though 
the letter was still in her hand it was now mechanically twisted 
about without regard emma waited the result with impatience 
but not without strong hopes at last with some hesitation 
harriet said 
miss woodhouse as you will not give me your opinion i must 
do as well as i can by myself and i have now quite determined 
and really almost made up my mind to refuse mr martin do you 
think i am right 
perfectly perfectly right my dearest harriet you are doing just 
what you ought while you were at all in suspense i kept my feelings 
to myself but now that you are so completely decided i have no 
hesitation in approving dear harriet i give myself joy of this 
it would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance which must have 
been the consequence of your marrying mr martin while you were in 
the smallest degree wavering i said nothing about it because i would 
not influence but it would have been the loss of a friend to me 
i could not have visited mrs robert martin of abbey mill farm 
now i am secure of you for ever 
harriet had not surmised her own danger but the idea of it struck 
her forcibly 
you could not have visited me she cried looking aghast 
no to be sure you could not but i never thought of that before 
that would have been too dreadful what an escape dear miss woodhouse 
i would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you 
for any thing in the world 
indeed harriet it would have been a severe pang to lose you 
but it must have been you would have thrown yourself out of all 
good society i must have given you up 
dear me how should i ever have borne it it would have killed 
me never to come to hartfield any more 
dear affectionate creature you banished to abbey mill farm you 
confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life 
i wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it 
he must have a pretty good opinion of himself 
i do not think he is conceited either in general said harriet 
her conscience opposing such censure at least he is very good natured 
and i shall always feel much obliged to him and have a great regard 
for but that is quite a different thing from and you know 
though he may like me it does not follow that i should and 
certainly i must confess that since my visiting here i have seen 
people and if one comes to compare them person and manners 
there is no comparison at all one is so very handsome and agreeable 
however i do really think mr martin a very amiable young man 
and have a great opinion of him and his being so much attached 
to me and his writing such a letter but as to leaving you 
it is what i would not do upon any consideration 
thank you thank you my own sweet little friend we will not 
be parted a woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked 
or because he is attached to her and can write a tolerable letter 
oh no and it is but a short letter too 
emma felt the bad taste of her friend but let it pass with a 
very true and it would be a small consolation to her for the 
clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day 
to know that her husband could write a good letter 
oh yes very nobody cares for a letter the thing is to be always 
happy with pleasant companions i am quite determined to refuse him 
but how shall i do what shall i say 
emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer 
and advised its being written directly which was agreed to 
in the hope of her assistance and though emma continued to protest 
against any assistance being wanted it was in fact given in the 
formation of every sentence the looking over his letter again 
in replying to it had such a softening tendency that it was 
particularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions 
and she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy 
and thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say 
and was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful 
that emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment 
he would have been accepted after all 
this letter however was written and sealed and sent 
the business was finished and harriet safe she was rather low 
all the evening but emma could allow for her amiable regrets 
and sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection 
sometimes by bringing forward the idea of mr elton 
i shall never be invited to abbey mill again was said in rather 
a sorrowful tone 
nor if you were could i ever bear to part with you my harriet 
you are a great deal too necessary at hartfield to be spared 
to abbey mill 
and i am sure i should never want to go there for i am never happy 
but at hartfield 
some time afterwards it was i think mrs goddard would be very 
much surprized if she knew what had happened i am sure miss nash 
would for miss nash thinks her own sister very well married 
and it is only a linen draper 
one should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the 
teacher of a school harriet i dare say miss nash would envy you 
such an opportunity as this of being married even this conquest 
would appear valuable in her eyes as to any thing superior for you 
i suppose she is quite in the dark the attentions of a certain 
person can hardly be among the tittle tattle of highbury yet 
hitherto i fancy you and i are the only people to whom his looks 
and manners have explained themselves 
harriet blushed and smiled and said something about wondering 
that people should like her so much the idea of mr elton was 
certainly cheering but still after a time she was tender hearted 
again towards the rejected mr martin 
now he has got my letter said she softly i wonder what they 
are all doing whether his sisters know if he is unhappy 
they will be unhappy too i hope he will not mind it so very much 
let us think of those among our absent friends who are more 
cheerfully employed cried emma at this moment perhaps mr elton 
is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters telling how much 
more beautiful is the original and after being asked for it five 
or six times allowing them to hear your name your own dear name 
my picture but he has left my picture in bond street 
has he so then i know nothing of mr elton no my dear 
little modest harriet depend upon it the picture will not be 
in bond street till just before he mounts his horse to morrow 
it is his companion all this evening his solace his delight 
it opens his designs to his family it introduces you among them 
it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature 
eager curiosity and warm prepossession how cheerful how animated 
how suspicious how busy their imaginations all are 
harriet smiled again and her smiles grew stronger 
chapter viii 
harriet slept at hartfield that night for some weeks past she 
had been spending more than half her time there and gradually 
getting to have a bed room appropriated to herself and emma 
judged it best in every respect safest and kindest to keep her 
with them as much as possible just at present she was obliged 
to go the next morning for an hour or two to mrs goddard s 
but it was then to be settled that she should return to hartfield 
to make a regular visit of some days 
while she was gone mr knightley called and sat some time with 
mr woodhouse and emma till mr woodhouse who had previously made up 
his mind to walk out was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it 
and was induced by the entreaties of both though against the scruples 
of his own civility to leave mr knightley for that purpose 
mr knightley who had nothing of ceremony about him was offering 
by his short decided answers an amusing contrast to the protracted 
apologies and civil hesitations of the other 
well i believe if you will excuse me mr knightley if you 
will not consider me as doing a very rude thing i shall take 
emma s advice and go out for a quarter of an hour as the sun 
is out i believe i had better take my three turns while i can 
i treat you without ceremony mr knightley we invalids think we 
are privileged people 
my dear sir do not make a stranger of me 
i leave an excellent substitute in my daughter emma will be happy 
to entertain you and therefore i think i will beg your excuse 
and take my three turns my winter walk 
you cannot do better sir 
i would ask for the pleasure of your company mr knightley 
but i am a very slow walker and my pace would be tedious to you 
and besides you have another long walk before you to donwell abbey 
thank you sir thank you i am going this moment myself and i 
think the sooner you go the better i will fetch your greatcoat 
and open the garden door for you 
mr woodhouse at last was off but mr knightley instead of being 
immediately off likewise sat down again seemingly inclined 
for more chat he began speaking of harriet and speaking 
of her with more voluntary praise than emma had ever heard before 
i cannot rate her beauty as you do said he but she is a 
pretty little creature and i am inclined to think very well of 
her disposition her character depends upon those she is with 
but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman 
i am glad you think so and the good hands i hope may not be wanting 
come said he you are anxious for a compliment so i will 
tell you that you have improved her you have cured her of her 
school girl s giggle she really does you credit 
thank you i should be mortified indeed if i did not believe i 
had been of some use but it is not every body who will bestow 
praise where they may you do not often overpower me with it 
you are expecting her again you say this morning 
almost every moment she has been gone longer already than 
she intended 
something has happened to delay her some visitors perhaps 
highbury gossips tiresome wretches 
harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would 
emma knew this was too true for contradiction and therefore 
said nothing he presently added with a smile 
i do not pretend to fix on times or places but i must tell you 
that i have good reason to believe your little friend will soon 
hear of something to her advantage 
indeed how so of what sort 
a very serious sort i assure you still smiling 
very serious i can think of but one thing who is in love 
with her who makes you their confidant 
emma was more than half in hopes of mr elton s having dropt a hint 
mr knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser and she knew 
mr elton looked up to him 
i have reason to think he replied that harriet smith will 
soon have an offer of marriage and from a most unexceptionable 
quarter robert martin is the man her visit to abbey mill 
this summer seems to have done his business he is desperately 
in love and means to marry her 
he is very obliging said emma but is he sure that harriet 
means to marry him 
well well means to make her an offer then will that do he came 
to the abbey two evenings ago on purpose to consult me about it 
he knows i have a thorough regard for him and all his family and 
i believe considers me as one of his best friends he came to ask 
me whether i thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early 
whether i thought her too young in short whether i approved his 
choice altogether having some apprehension perhaps of her being 
considered especially since your making so much of her as in a line 
of society above him i was very much pleased with all that he said 
i never hear better sense from any one than robert martin 
he always speaks to the purpose open straightforward and very 
well judging he told me every thing his circumstances and plans 
and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage he is 
an excellent young man both as son and brother i had no hesitation 
in advising him to marry he proved to me that he could afford it 
and that being the case i was convinced he could not do better 
i praised the fair lady too and altogether sent him away very happy 
if he had never esteemed my opinion before he would have thought 
highly of me then and i dare say left the house thinking me the 
best friend and counsellor man ever had this happened the night 
before last now as we may fairly suppose he would not allow 
much time to pass before he spoke to the lady and as he does not 
appear to have spoken yesterday it is not unlikely that he should 
be at mrs goddard s to day and she may be detained by a visitor 
without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch 
pray mr knightley said emma who had been smiling to herself 
through a great part of this speech how do you know that mr martin 
did not speak yesterday 
certainly replied he surprized i do not absolutely know it 
but it may be inferred was not she the whole day with you 
come said she i will tell you something in return for what 
you have told me he did speak yesterday that is he wrote 
and was refused 
this was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed 
and mr knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure 
as he stood up in tall indignation and said 
then she is a greater simpleton than i ever believed her 
what is the foolish girl about 
oh to be sure cried emma it is always incomprehensible 
to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage 
a man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her 
nonsense a man does not imagine any such thing but what is 
the meaning of this harriet smith refuse robert martin madness 
if it is so but i hope you are mistaken 
i saw her answer nothing could be clearer 
you saw her answer you wrote her answer too emma this is 
your doing you persuaded her to refuse him 
and if i did which however i am far from allowing i should 
not feel that i had done wrong mr martin is a very respectable 
young man but i cannot admit him to be harriet s equal and am 
rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her 
by your account he does seem to have had some scruples it is 
a pity that they were ever got over 
not harriet s equal exclaimed mr knightley loudly and warmly 
and with calmer asperity added a few moments afterwards no he 
is not her equal indeed for he is as much her superior in sense 
as in situation emma your infatuation about that girl blinds you 
what are harriet smith s claims either of birth nature or education 
to any connexion higher than robert martin she is the natural 
daughter of nobody knows whom with probably no settled provision 
at all and certainly no respectable relations she is known only 
as parlour boarder at a common school she is not a sensible girl 
nor a girl of any information she has been taught nothing useful 
and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself 
at her age she can have no experience and with her little wit 
is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her 
she is pretty and she is good tempered and that is all 
my only scruple in advising the match was on his account as being 
beneath his deserts and a bad connexion for him i felt that 
as to fortune in all probability he might do much better and that as 
to a rational companion or useful helpmate he could not do worse 
but i could not reason so to a man in love and was willing 
to trust to there being no harm in her to her having that sort 
of disposition which in good hands like his might be easily led 
aright and turn out very well the advantage of the match i felt 
to be all on her side and had not the smallest doubt nor have i now 
that there would be a general cry out upon her extreme good luck 
even your satisfaction i made sure of it crossed my mind immediately 
that you would not regret your friend s leaving highbury for the 
sake of her being settled so well i remember saying to myself 
even emma with all her partiality for harriet will think this a 
good match 
i cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of emma as to say 
any such thing what think a farmer and with all his sense and all 
his merit mr martin is nothing more a good match for my intimate 
friend not regret her leaving highbury for the sake of marrying 
a man whom i could never admit as an acquaintance of my own i 
wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings 
i assure you mine are very different i must think your statement 
by no means fair you are not just to harriet s claims 
they would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself 
mr martin may be the richest of the two but he is undoubtedly 
her inferior as to rank in society the sphere in which she moves 
is much above his it would be a degradation 
a degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance to be married 
to a respectable intelligent gentleman farmer 
as to the circumstances of her birth though in a legal sense 
she may be called nobody it will not hold in common sense 
she is not to pay for the offence of others by being held below 
the level of those with whom she is brought up there can scarcely 
be a doubt that her father is a gentleman and a gentleman of 
fortune her allowance is very liberal nothing has ever been grudged 
for her improvement or comfort that she is a gentleman s daughter 
is indubitable to me that she associates with gentlemen s daughters 
no one i apprehend will deny she is superior to mr robert martin 
whoever might be her parents said mr knightley whoever may 
have had the charge of her it does not appear to have been any part 
of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society 
after receiving a very indifferent education she is left in 
mrs goddard s hands to shift as she can to move in short 
in mrs goddard s line to have mrs goddard s acquaintance 
her friends evidently thought this good enough for her and it was 
good enough she desired nothing better herself till you chose 
to turn her into a friend her mind had no distaste for her own set 
nor any ambition beyond it she was as happy as possible with the 
martins in the summer she had no sense of superiority then 
if she has it now you have given it you have been no friend to 
harriet smith emma robert martin would never have proceeded so far 
if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him 
i know him well he has too much real feeling to address any 
woman on the haphazard of selfish passion and as to conceit 
he is the farthest from it of any man i know depend upon it he 
had encouragement 
it was most convenient to emma not to make a direct reply to this 
assertion she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again 
you are a very warm friend to mr martin but as i said before 
are unjust to harriet harriet s claims to marry well are not 
so contemptible as you represent them she is not a clever girl 
but she has better sense than you are aware of and does not 
deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly 
waiving that point however and supposing her to be as you 
describe her only pretty and good natured let me tell you that in 
the degree she possesses them they are not trivial recommendations 
to the world in general for she is in fact a beautiful girl 
and must be thought so by ninety nine people out of an hundred 
and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject 
of beauty than they are generally supposed till they do fall 
in love with well informed minds instead of handsome faces a girl 
with such loveliness as harriet has a certainty of being admired 
and sought after of having the power of chusing from among many 
consequently a claim to be nice her good nature too is not so very 
slight a claim comprehending as it does real thorough sweetness 
of temper and manner a very humble opinion of herself and a great 
readiness to be pleased with other people i am very much mistaken 
if your sex in general would not think such beauty and such temper 
the highest claims a woman could possess 
upon my word emma to hear you abusing the reason you have 
is almost enough to make me think so too better be without sense 
than misapply it as you do 
to be sure cried she playfully i know that is the feeling 
of you all i know that such a girl as harriet is exactly 
what every man delights in what at once bewitches his senses 
and satisfies his judgment oh harriet may pick and chuse 
were you yourself ever to marry she is the very woman for you 
and is she at seventeen just entering into life just beginning 
to be known to be wondered at because she does not accept the first 
offer she receives no pray let her have time to look about her 
i have always thought it a very foolish intimacy said mr knightley 
presently though i have kept my thoughts to myself but i now 
perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for harriet 
you will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty and of what 
she has a claim to that in a little while nobody within her 
reach will be good enough for her vanity working on a weak head 
produces every sort of mischief nothing so easy as for a young lady 
to raise her expectations too high miss harriet smith may not find 
offers of marriage flow in so fast though she is a very pretty girl 
men of sense whatever you may chuse to say do not want silly wives 
men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves 
with a girl of such obscurity and most prudent men would be 
afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in 
when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed let her marry 
robert martin and she is safe respectable and happy for ever 
but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly and teach 
her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence 
and large fortune she may be a parlour boarder at mrs goddard s 
all the rest of her life or at least for harriet smith is a 
girl who will marry somebody or other till she grow desperate 
and is glad to catch at the old writing master s son 
we think so very differently on this point mr knightley 
that there can be no use in canvassing it we shall only be making 
each other more angry but as to my letting her marry robert martin 
it is impossible she has refused him and so decidedly i think 
as must prevent any second application she must abide by the evil 
of having refused him whatever it may be and as to the refusal itself 
i will not pretend to say that i might not influence her a little 
but i assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do 
his appearance is so much against him and his manner so bad 
that if she ever were disposed to favour him she is not now 
i can imagine that before she had seen any body superior 
she might tolerate him he was the brother of her friends 
and he took pains to please her and altogether having seen 
nobody better that must have been his great assistant 
she might not while she was at abbey mill find him disagreeable 
but the case is altered now she knows now what gentlemen are 
and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance 
with harriet 
nonsense errant nonsense as ever was talked cried mr knightley robert 
martin s manners have sense sincerity and good humour to recommend 
them and his mind has more true gentility than harriet smith could understand 
emma made no answer and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned but was 
really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone 
she did not repent what she had done she still thought herself 
a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he 
could be but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment 
in general which made her dislike having it so loudly against her 
and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state 
was very disagreeable some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence 
with only one attempt on emma s side to talk of the weather 
but he made no answer he was thinking the result of his thoughts 
appeared at last in these words 
robert martin has no great loss if he can but think so and i 
hope it will not be long before he does your views for harriet 
are best known to yourself but as you make no secret of your love 
of match making it is fair to suppose that views and plans 
and projects you have and as a friend i shall just hint to you 
that if elton is the man i think it will be all labour in vain 
emma laughed and disclaimed he continued 
depend upon it elton will not do elton is a very good sort of man 
and a very respectable vicar of highbury but not at all likely 
to make an imprudent match he knows the value of a good income 
as well as any body elton may talk sentimentally but he will 
act rationally he is as well acquainted with his own claims as you 
can be with harriet s he knows that he is a very handsome young man 
and a great favourite wherever he goes and from his general way 
of talking in unreserved moments when there are only men present 
i am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away 
i have heard him speak with great animation of a large family 
of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with who have all 
twenty thousand pounds apiece 
i am very much obliged to you said emma laughing again 
if i had set my heart on mr elton s marrying harriet it would 
have been very kind to open my eyes but at present i only want 
to keep harriet to myself i have done with match making indeed 
i could never hope to equal my own doings at randalls i shall leave 
off while i am well 
good morning to you said he rising and walking off abruptly 
he was very much vexed he felt the disappointment of the young man 
and was mortified to have been the means of promoting it by the 
sanction he had given and the part which he was persuaded emma had 
taken in the affair was provoking him exceedingly 
emma remained in a state of vexation too but there was more 
indistinctness in the causes of her s than in his she did not always 
feel so absolutely satisfied with herself so entirely convinced that 
her opinions were right and her adversary s wrong as mr knightley 
he walked off in more complete self approbation than he left for her 
she was not so materially cast down however but that a little 
time and the return of harriet were very adequate restoratives 
harriet s staying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy 
the possibility of the young man s coming to mrs goddard s 
that morning and meeting with harriet and pleading his own because 
gave alarming ideas the dread of such a failure after all became the 
prominent uneasiness and when harriet appeared and in very good spirits 
and without having any such reason to give for her long absence 
she felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind 
and convinced her that let mr knightley think or say what he would 
she had done nothing which woman s friendship and woman s feelings 
would not justify 
he had frightened her a little about mr elton but when she considered 
that mr knightley could not have observed him as she had done 
neither with the interest nor she must be allowed to tell herself 
in spite of mr knightley s pretensions with the skill of such 
an observer on such a question as herself that he had spoken it 
hastily and in anger she was able to believe that he had rather 
said what he wished resentfully to be true than what he knew 
any thing about he certainly might have heard mr elton speak 
with more unreserve than she had ever done and mr elton might not 
be of an imprudent inconsiderate disposition as to money matters 
he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them 
but then mr knightley did not make due allowance for the influence 
of a strong passion at war with all interested motives mr knightley 
saw no such passion and of course thought nothing of its effects 
but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any 
hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest 
and more than a reasonable becoming degree of prudence she was very 
sure did not belong to mr elton 
harriet s cheerful look and manner established hers she came back 
not to think of mr martin but to talk of mr elton miss nash 
had been telling her something which she repeated immediately 
with great delight mr perry had been to mrs goddard s to attend 
a sick child and miss nash had seen him and he had told miss nash 
that as he was coming back yesterday from clayton park he had met 
mr elton and found to his great surprize that mr elton was 
actually on his road to london and not meaning to return till 
the morrow though it was the whist club night which he had been 
never known to miss before and mr perry had remonstrated with him 
about it and told him how shabby it was in him their best player 
to absent himself and tried very much to persuade him to put off 
his journey only one day but it would not do mr elton had been 
determined to go on and had said in a very particular way indeed 
that he was going on business which he would not put off for any 
inducement in the world and something about a very enviable commission 
and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious mr perry 
could not quite understand him but he was very sure there must 
be a lady in the case and he told him so and mr elton only 
looked very conscious and smiling and rode off in great spirits 
miss nash had told her all this and had talked a great deal more 
about mr elton and said looking so very significantly at her 
that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be 
but she only knew that any woman whom mr elton could prefer 
she should think the luckiest woman in the world for beyond a doubt 
mr elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness 
chapter ix 
mr knightley might quarrel with her but emma could not quarrel 
with herself he was so much displeased that it was longer than 
usual before he came to hartfield again and when they did meet 
his grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven she was sorry 
but could not repent on the contrary her plans and proceedings 
were more and more justified and endeared to her by the general 
appearances of the next few days 
the picture elegantly framed came safely to hand soon after 
mr elton s return and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common 
sitting room he got up to look at it and sighed out his half sentences 
of admiration just as he ought and as for harriet s feelings they were 
visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment 
as her youth and sort of mind admitted emma was soon perfectly 
satisfied of mr martin s being no otherwise remembered than as 
he furnished a contrast with mr elton of the utmost advantage to the latter 
her views of improving her little friend s mind by a great deal 
of useful reading and conversation had never yet led to more than 
a few first chapters and the intention of going on to morrow 
it was much easier to chat than to study much pleasanter to let 
her imagination range and work at harriet s fortune than to be 
labouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts 
and the only literary pursuit which engaged harriet at present 
the only mental provision she was making for the evening of life 
was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort 
that she could meet with into a thin quarto of hot pressed paper 
made up by her friend and ornamented with ciphers and trophies 
in this age of literature such collections on a very grand scale 
are not uncommon miss nash head teacher at mrs goddard s 
had written out at least three hundred and harriet who had taken 
the first hint of it from her hoped with miss woodhouse s help 
to get a great many more emma assisted with her invention 
memory and taste and as harriet wrote a very pretty hand 
it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order in form 
as well as quantity 
mr woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls 
and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in 
so many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young he 
wondered he could not remember them but he hoped he should in time 
and it always ended in kitty a fair but frozen maid 
his good friend perry too whom he had spoken to on the subject 
did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind 
but he had desired perry to be upon the watch and as he went about 
so much something he thought might come from that quarter 
it was by no means his daughter s wish that the intellects of 
highbury in general should be put under requisition mr elton 
was the only one whose assistance she asked he was invited 
to contribute any really good enigmas charades or conundrums 
that he might recollect and she had the pleasure of seeing him 
most intently at work with his recollections and at the same time 
as she could perceive most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant 
nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass 
his lips they owed to him their two or three politest puzzles 
and the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled 
and rather sentimentally recited that well known charade 
my first doth affliction denote 
which my second is destin d to feel 
and my whole is the best antidote 
that affliction to soften and heal 
made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it 
some pages ago already 
why will not you write one yourself for us mr elton said she 
that is the only security for its freshness and nothing could be 
easier to you 
oh no he had never written hardly ever any thing of the kind 
in his life the stupidest fellow he was afraid not even miss 
woodhouse he stopt a moment or miss smith could inspire him 
the very next day however produced some proof of inspiration 
he called for a few moments just to leave a piece of paper on the 
table containing as he said a charade which a friend of his had 
addressed to a young lady the object of his admiration but which 
from his manner emma was immediately convinced must be his own 
i do not offer it for miss smith s collection said he 
being my friend s i have no right to expose it in any degree 
to the public eye but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it 
the speech was more to emma than to harriet which emma 
could understand there was deep consciousness about him 
and he found it easier to meet her eye than her friend s 
he was gone the next moment after another moment s pause 
take it said emma smiling and pushing the paper towards 
harriet it is for you take your own 
but harriet was in a tremor and could not touch it and emma 
never loth to be first was obliged to examine it herself 
to miss 
charade 
my first displays the wealth and pomp of kings 
lords of the earth their luxury and ease 
another view of man my second brings 
behold him there the monarch of the seas 
but ah united what reverse we have 
man s boasted power and freedom all are flown 
lord of the earth and sea he bends a slave 
and woman lovely woman reigns alone 
thy ready wit the word will soon supply 
may its approval beam in that soft eye 
she cast her eye over it pondered caught the meaning read it through 
again to be quite certain and quite mistress of the lines and then 
passing it to harriet sat happily smiling and saying to herself 
while harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion 
of hope and dulness very well mr elton very well indeed 
i have read worse charades courtship a very good hint i give 
you credit for it this is feeling your way this is saying very 
plainly pray miss smith give me leave to pay my addresses to you 
approve my charade and my intentions in the same glance 
may its approval beam in that soft eye 
harriet exactly soft is the very word for her eye of all epithets 
the justest that could be given 
thy ready wit the word will soon supply 
humph harriet s ready wit all the better a man must be very much 
in love indeed to describe her so ah mr knightley i wish 
you had the benefit of this i think this would convince you 
for once in your life you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken 
an excellent charade indeed and very much to the purpose 
things must come to a crisis soon now 
she was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations 
which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length by the 
eagerness of harriet s wondering questions 
what can it be miss woodhouse what can it be i have not an idea i 
cannot guess it in the least what can it possibly be do try 
to find it out miss woodhouse do help me i never saw any thing 
so hard is it kingdom i wonder who the friend was and who could 
be the young lady do you think it is a good one can it be woman 
and woman lovely woman reigns alone 
can it be neptune 
behold him there the monarch of the seas 
or a trident or a mermaid or a shark oh no shark is only 
one syllable it must be very clever or he would not have brought it 
oh miss woodhouse do you think we shall ever find it out 
mermaids and sharks nonsense my dear harriet what are you 
thinking of where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made 
by a friend upon a mermaid or a shark give me the paper and listen 
for miss read miss smith 
my first displays the wealth and pomp of kings 
lords of the earth their luxury and ease 
that is court 
another view of man my second brings 
behold him there the monarch of the seas 
that is ship plain as it can be now for the cream 
but ah united courtship you know what reverse we have 
man s boasted power and freedom all are flown 
lord of the earth and sea he bends a slave 
and woman lovely woman reigns alone 
a very proper compliment and then follows the application 
which i think my dear harriet you cannot find much difficulty 
in comprehending read it in comfort to yourself there can 
be no doubt of its being written for you and to you 
harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion 
she read the concluding lines and was all flutter and happiness 
she could not speak but she was not wanted to speak it was enough 
for her to feel emma spoke for her 
there is so pointed and so particular a meaning in this compliment 
said she that i cannot have a doubt as to mr elton s intentions 
you are his object and you will soon receive the completest proof 
of it i thought it must be so i thought i could not be so deceived 
but now it is clear the state of his mind is as clear and decided 
as my wishes on the subject have been ever since i knew you 
yes harriet just so long have i been wanting the very circumstance 
to happen what has happened i could never tell whether an attachment 
between you and mr elton were most desirable or most natural 
its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each 
other i am very happy i congratulate you my dear harriet with all 
my heart this is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride 
in creating this is a connexion which offers nothing but good 
it will give you every thing that you want consideration independence 
a proper home it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends 
close to hartfield and to me and confirm our intimacy for ever 
this harriet is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either 
of us 
dear miss woodhouse and dear miss woodhouse was all that harriet 
with many tender embraces could articulate at first but when they 
did arrive at something more like conversation it was sufficiently 
clear to her friend that she saw felt anticipated and remembered 
just as she ought mr elton s superiority had very ample acknowledgment 
whatever you say is always right cried harriet and therefore 
i suppose and believe and hope it must be so but otherwise i could 
not have imagined it it is so much beyond any thing i deserve 
mr elton who might marry any body there cannot be two opinions 
about him he is so very superior only think of those sweet 
verses to miss dear me how clever could it really 
be meant for me 
i cannot make a question or listen to a question about that 
it is a certainty receive it on my judgment it is a sort 
of prologue to the play a motto to the chapter and will be soon 
followed by matter of fact prose 
it is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected i am sure 
a month ago i had no more idea myself the strangest things do 
take place 
when miss smiths and mr eltons get acquainted they do indeed and 
really it is strange it is out of the common course that what is 
so evidently so palpably desirable what courts the pre arrangement 
of other people should so immediately shape itself into the proper form 
you and mr elton are by situation called together you belong 
to one another by every circumstance of your respective homes 
your marrying will be equal to the match at randalls there does 
seem to be a something in the air of hartfield which gives love 
exactly the right direction and sends it into the very channel 
where it ought to flow 
the course of true love never did run smooth 
a hartfield edition of shakespeare would have a long note on that passage 
that mr elton should really be in love with me me of all people 
who did not know him to speak to him at michaelmas and he 
the very handsomest man that ever was and a man that every body 
looks up to quite like mr knightley his company so sought after 
that every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he 
does not chuse it that he has more invitations than there are days 
in the week and so excellent in the church miss nash has put down 
all the texts he has ever preached from since he came to highbury 
dear me when i look back to the first time i saw him how little 
did i think the two abbots and i ran into the front room and 
peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by and miss 
nash came and scolded us away and staid to look through herself 
however she called me back presently and let me look too 
which was very good natured and how beautiful we thought he looked 
he was arm in arm with mr cole 
this is an alliance which whoever whatever your friends may be 
must be agreeable to them provided at least they have common sense 
and we are not to be addressing our conduct to fools if they 
are anxious to see you happily married here is a man whose amiable 
character gives every assurance of it if they wish to have you 
settled in the same country and circle which they have chosen 
to place you in here it will be accomplished and if their only 
object is that you should in the common phrase be well married 
here is the comfortable fortune the respectable establishment 
the rise in the world which must satisfy them 
yes very true how nicely you talk i love to hear you 
you understand every thing you and mr elton are one as clever 
as the other this charade if i had studied a twelvemonth 
i could never have made any thing like it 
i thought he meant to try his skill by his manner of declining 
it yesterday 
i do think it is without exception the best charade i ever read 
i never read one more to the purpose certainly 
it is as long again as almost all we have had before 
i do not consider its length as particularly in its favour 
such things in general cannot be too short 
harriet was too intent on the lines to hear the most satisfactory 
comparisons were rising in her mind 
it is one thing said she presently her cheeks in a glow to 
have very good sense in a common way like every body else 
and if there is any thing to say to sit down and write a letter 
and say just what you must in a short way and another to write 
verses and charades like this 
emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of mr martin s prose 
such sweet lines continued harriet these two last but 
how shall i ever be able to return the paper or say i have found 
it out oh miss woodhouse what can we do about that 
leave it to me you do nothing he will be here this evening 
i dare say and then i will give it him back and some nonsense 
or other will pass between us and you shall not be committed your 
soft eyes shall chuse their own time for beaming trust to me 
oh miss woodhouse what a pity that i must not write this beautiful 
charade into my book i am sure i have not got one half so good 
leave out the two last lines and there is no reason why you 
should not write it into your book 
oh but those two lines are 
the best of all granted for private enjoyment and for private 
enjoyment keep them they are not at all the less written you know 
because you divide them the couplet does not cease to be nor does 
its meaning change but take it away and all appropriation ceases 
and a very pretty gallant charade remains fit for any collection 
depend upon it he would not like to have his charade slighted 
much better than his passion a poet in love must be encouraged in 
both capacities or neither give me the book i will write it down 
and then there can be no possible reflection on you 
harriet submitted though her mind could hardly separate the parts 
so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down 
a declaration of love it seemed too precious an offering for any 
degree of publicity 
i shall never let that book go out of my own hands said she 
very well replied emma a most natural feeling and the longer 
it lasts the better i shall be pleased but here is my father 
coming you will not object to my reading the charade to him 
it will be giving him so much pleasure he loves any thing of 
the sort and especially any thing that pays woman a compliment 
he has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all you must 
let me read it to him 
harriet looked grave 
my dear harriet you must not refine too much upon this 
charade you will betray your feelings improperly if you are 
too conscious and too quick and appear to affix more meaning 
or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it 
do not be overpowered by such a little tribute of admiration 
if he had been anxious for secrecy he would not have left the paper 
while i was by but he rather pushed it towards me than towards you 
do not let us be too solemn on the business he has encouragement 
enough to proceed without our sighing out our souls over this charade 
oh no i hope i shall not be ridiculous about it do as you please 
mr woodhouse came in and very soon led to the subject again 
by the recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of well my dears 
how does your book go on have you got any thing fresh 
yes papa we have something to read you something quite fresh 
a piece of paper was found on the table this morning dropt 
we suppose by a fairy containing a very pretty charade and we 
have just copied it in 
she read it to him just as he liked to have any thing read 
slowly and distinctly and two or three times over with explanations 
of every part as she proceeded and he was very much pleased and 
as she had foreseen especially struck with the complimentary conclusion 
aye that is very just indeed that is very properly said 
very true woman lovely woman it is such a pretty charade 
my dear that i can easily guess what fairy brought it nobody 
could have written so prettily but you emma 
emma only nodded and smiled after a little thinking 
and a very tender sigh he added 
ah it is no difficulty to see who you take after your dear mother 
was so clever at all those things if i had but her memory but i 
can remember nothing not even that particular riddle which you 
have heard me mention i can only recollect the first stanza 
and there are several 
kitty a fair but frozen maid 
kindled a flame i yet deplore 
the hood wink d boy i called to aid 
though of his near approach afraid 
so fatal to my suit before 
and that is all that i can recollect of it but it is very clever 
all the way through but i think my dear you said you had got it 
yes papa it is written out in our second page we copied it 
from the elegant extracts it was garrick s you know 
aye very true i wish i could recollect more of it 
kitty a fair but frozen maid 
the name makes me think of poor isabella for she was very near 
being christened catherine after her grandmama i hope we shall 
have her here next week have you thought my dear where you 
shall put her and what room there will be for the children 
oh yes she will have her own room of course the room she always 
has and there is the nursery for the children just as usual 
you know why should there be any change 
i do not know my dear but it is so long since she was here not 
since last easter and then only for a few days mr john knightley s 
being a lawyer is very inconvenient poor isabella she is sadly 
taken away from us all and how sorry she will be when she comes 
not to see miss taylor here 
she will not be surprized papa at least 
i do not know my dear i am sure i was very much surprized 
when i first heard she was going to be married 
we must ask mr and mrs weston to dine with us while isabella 
is here 
yes my dear if there is time but in a very depressed tone she 
is coming for only one week there will not be time for any thing 
it is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer but it seems a case 
of necessity mr john knightley must be in town again on the th 
and we ought to be thankful papa that we are to have the whole 
of the time they can give to the country that two or three days 
are not to be taken out for the abbey mr knightley promises 
to give up his claim this christmas though you know it is longer 
since they were with him than with us 
it would be very hard indeed my dear if poor isabella were 
to be anywhere but at hartfield 
mr woodhouse could never allow for mr knightley s claims on 
his brother or any body s claims on isabella except his own 
he sat musing a little while and then said 
but i do not see why poor isabella should be obliged to go back 
so soon though he does i think emma i shall try and persuade 
her to stay longer with us she and the children might stay very well 
ah papa that is what you never have been able to accomplish 
and i do not think you ever will isabella cannot bear to stay 
behind her husband 
this was too true for contradiction unwelcome as it was mr woodhouse 
could only give a submissive sigh and as emma saw his spirits 
affected by the idea of his daughter s attachment to her husband 
she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them 
harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while 
my brother and sister are here i am sure she will be pleased 
with the children we are very proud of the children are not we 
papa i wonder which she will think the handsomest henry or john 
aye i wonder which she will poor little dears how glad they 
will be to come they are very fond of being at hartfield harriet 
i dare say they are sir i am sure i do not know who is not 
henry is a fine boy but john is very like his mama henry is the eldest 
he was named after me not after his father john the second 
is named after his father some people are surprized i believe 
that the eldest was not but isabella would have him called henry 
which i thought very pretty of her and he is a very clever boy 
indeed they are all remarkably clever and they have so many 
pretty ways they will come and stand by my chair and say 
grandpapa can you give me a bit of string and once henry asked me 
for a knife but i told him knives were only made for grandpapas 
i think their father is too rough with them very often 
he appears rough to you said emma because you are so very 
gentle yourself but if you could compare him with other papas 
you would not think him rough he wishes his boys to be active and hardy 
and if they misbehave can give them a sharp word now and then 
but he is an affectionate father certainly mr john knightley 
is an affectionate father the children are all fond of him 
and then their uncle comes in and tosses them up to the ceiling 
in a very frightful way 
but they like it papa there is nothing they like so much 
it is such enjoyment to them that if their uncle did not lay down 
the rule of their taking turns whichever began would never give way 
to the other 
well i cannot understand it 
that is the case with us all papa one half of the world cannot 
understand the pleasures of the other 
later in the morning and just as the girls were going to separate 
in preparation for the regular four of the clock dinner the hero 
of this inimitable charade walked in again harriet turned away 
but emma could receive him with the usual smile and her quick eye 
soon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a push of 
having thrown a die and she imagined he was come to see how it 
might turn up his ostensible reason however was to ask whether 
mr woodhouse s party could be made up in the evening without him 
or whether he should be in the smallest degree necessary at hartfield 
if he were every thing else must give way but otherwise his friend 
cole had been saying so much about his dining with him had made 
such a point of it that he had promised him conditionally to come 
emma thanked him but could not allow of his disappointing his 
friend on their account her father was sure of his rubber 
he re urged she re declined and he seemed then about to make 
his bow when taking the paper from the table she returned it 
oh here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us 
thank you for the sight of it we admired it so much that i have 
ventured to write it into miss smith s collection your friend 
will not take it amiss i hope of course i have not transcribed 
beyond the first eight lines 
mr elton certainly did not very well know what to say 
he looked rather doubtingly rather confused said something about 
honour glanced at emma and at harriet and then seeing the book 
open on the table took it up and examined it very attentively 
with the view of passing off an awkward moment emma smilingly said 
you must make my apologies to your friend but so good a charade 
must not be confined to one or two he may be sure of every woman s 
approbation while he writes with such gallantry 
i have no hesitation in saying replied mr elton though hesitating 
a good deal while he spoke i have no hesitation in saying at 
least if my friend feels at all as i do i have not the smallest 
doubt that could he see his little effusion honoured as i see it 
looking at the book again and replacing it on the table he 
would consider it as the proudest moment of his life 
after this speech he was gone as soon as possible emma could not 
think it too soon for with all his good and agreeable qualities 
there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt 
to incline her to laugh she ran away to indulge the inclination 
leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to harriet s share 
chapter x 
though now the middle of december there had yet been no weather 
to prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise 
and on the morrow emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor 
sick family who lived a little way out of highbury 
their road to this detached cottage was down vicarage lane a lane 
leading at right angles from the broad though irregular main street 
of the place and as may be inferred containing the blessed abode 
of mr elton a few inferior dwellings were first to be passed 
and then about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the vicarage 
an old and not very good house almost as close to the road as it 
could be it had no advantage of situation but had been very much 
smartened up by the present proprietor and such as it was 
there could be no possibility of the two friends passing it without 
a slackened pace and observing eyes emma s remark was 
there it is there go you and your riddle book one of these days 
harriet s was 
oh what a sweet house how very beautiful there are the yellow 
curtains that miss nash admires so much 
i do not often walk this way now said emma as they proceeded 
but then there will be an inducement and i shall gradually get 
intimately acquainted with all the hedges gates pools and pollards 
of this part of highbury 
harriet she found had never in her life been within side the vicarage 
and her curiosity to see it was so extreme that considering exteriors 
and probabilities emma could only class it as a proof of love 
with mr elton s seeing ready wit in her 
i wish we could contrive it said she but i cannot think 
of any tolerable pretence for going in no servant that i want 
to inquire about of his housekeeper no message from my father 
she pondered but could think of nothing after a mutual silence 
of some minutes harriet thus began again 
i do so wonder miss woodhouse that you should not be married 
or going to be married so charming as you are 
emma laughed and replied 
my being charming harriet is not quite enough to induce me to marry 
i must find other people charming one other person at least 
and i am not only not going to be married at present but have 
very little intention of ever marrying at all 
ah so you say but i cannot believe it 
i must see somebody very superior to any one i have seen yet 
to be tempted mr elton you know recollecting herself 
is out of the question and i do not wish to see any such person 
i would rather not be tempted i cannot really change for the better 
if i were to marry i must expect to repent it 
dear me it is so odd to hear a woman talk so 
i have none of the usual inducements of women to marry 
were i to fall in love indeed it would be a different thing 
but i never have been in love it is not my way or my nature 
and i do not think i ever shall and without love i am sure i 
should be a fool to change such a situation as mine fortune i 
do not want employment i do not want consequence i do not want 
i believe few married women are half as much mistress of their 
husband s house as i am of hartfield and never never could i expect 
to be so truly beloved and important so always first and always 
right in any man s eyes as i am in my father s 
but then to be an old maid at last like miss bates 
that is as formidable an image as you could present harriet and if i 
thought i should ever be like miss bates so silly so satisfied 
so smiling so prosing so undistinguishing and unfastidious 
and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me 
i would marry to morrow but between us i am convinced there never 
can be any likeness except in being unmarried 
but still you will be an old maid and that is so dreadful 
never mind harriet i shall not be a poor old maid and it is 
poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public 
a single woman with a very narrow income must be a ridiculous 
disagreeable old maid the proper sport of boys and girls 
but a single woman of good fortune is always respectable 
and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else and the 
distinction is not quite so much against the candour and common 
sense of the world as appears at first for a very narrow income 
has a tendency to contract the mind and sour the temper 
those who can barely live and who live perforce in a very small 
and generally very inferior society may well be illiberal and cross 
this does not apply however to miss bates she is only too good 
natured and too silly to suit me but in general she is very 
much to the taste of every body though single and though poor 
poverty certainly has not contracted her mind i really believe 
if she had only a shilling in the world she would be very likely 
to give away sixpence of it and nobody is afraid of her that is a 
great charm 
dear me but what shall you do how shall you employ yourself 
when you grow old 
if i know myself harriet mine is an active busy mind with a great 
many independent resources and i do not perceive why i should be 
more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one and twenty 
woman s usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then 
as they are now or with no important variation if i draw less 
i shall read more if i give up music i shall take to carpet work 
and as for objects of interest objects for the affections 
which is in truth the great point of inferiority the want of which 
is really the great evil to be avoided in not marrying i shall 
be very well off with all the children of a sister i love so much 
to care about there will be enough of them in all probability 
to supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need 
there will be enough for every hope and every fear and though my 
attachment to none can equal that of a parent it suits my ideas 
of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder my nephews 
and nieces i shall often have a niece with me 
do you know miss bates s niece that is i know you must have 
seen her a hundred times but are you acquainted 
oh yes we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes 
to highbury by the bye that is almost enough to put one out 
of conceit with a niece heaven forbid at least that i should 
ever bore people half so much about all the knightleys together 
as she does about jane fairfax one is sick of the very name 
of jane fairfax every letter from her is read forty times over 
her compliments to all friends go round and round again and if she 
does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher or knit a pair 
of garters for her grandmother one hears of nothing else for a month 
i wish jane fairfax very well but she tires me to death 
they were now approaching the cottage and all idle topics 
were superseded emma was very compassionate and the distresses 
of the poor were as sure of relief from her personal attention 
and kindness her counsel and her patience as from her purse 
she understood their ways could allow for their ignorance and 
their temptations had no romantic expectations of extraordinary 
virtue from those for whom education had done so little entered into 
their troubles with ready sympathy and always gave her assistance 
with as much intelligence as good will in the present instance 
it was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit 
and after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice 
she quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene 
as made her say to harriet as they walked away 
these are the sights harriet to do one good how trifling they 
make every thing else appear i feel now as if i could think of 
nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day and yet 
who can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind 
very true said harriet poor creatures one can think 
of nothing else 
and really i do not think the impression will soon be over 
said emma as she crossed the low hedge and tottering footstep 
which ended the narrow slippery path through the cottage garden 
and brought them into the lane again i do not think it will 
stopping to look once more at all the outward wretchedness of the place 
and recall the still greater within 
oh dear no said her companion 
they walked on the lane made a slight bend and when that bend 
was passed mr elton was immediately in sight and so near 
as to give emma time only to say farther 
ah harriet here comes a very sudden trial of our stability 
in good thoughts well smiling i hope it may be allowed that 
if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers 
it has done all that is truly important if we feel for the wretched 
enough to do all we can for them the rest is empty sympathy 
only distressing to ourselves 
harriet could just answer oh dear yes before the gentleman 
joined them the wants and sufferings of the poor family however 
were the first subject on meeting he had been going to call 
on them his visit he would now defer but they had a very 
interesting parley about what could be done and should be done 
mr elton then turned back to accompany them 
to fall in with each other on such an errand as this thought emma 
to meet in a charitable scheme this will bring a great increase 
of love on each side i should not wonder if it were to bring 
on the declaration it must if i were not here i wish i were 
anywhere else 
anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could she soon 
afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath a little raised 
on one side of the lane leaving them together in the main road 
but she had not been there two minutes when she found that harriet s 
habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too and that 
in short they would both be soon after her this would not do 
she immediately stopped under pretence of having some alteration 
to make in the lacing of her half boot and stooping down in complete 
occupation of the footpath begged them to have the goodness to walk on 
and she would follow in half a minute they did as they were desired 
and by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot 
she had the comfort of farther delay in her power being overtaken 
by a child from the cottage setting out according to orders 
with her pitcher to fetch broth from hartfield to walk by the side 
of this child and talk to and question her was the most natural 
thing in the world or would have been the most natural had she been 
acting just then without design and by this means the others were 
still able to keep ahead without any obligation of waiting for her 
she gained on them however involuntarily the child s pace was quick 
and theirs rather slow and she was the more concerned at it 
from their being evidently in a conversation which interested them 
mr elton was speaking with animation harriet listening with a very 
pleased attention and emma having sent the child on was beginning 
to think how she might draw back a little more when they both 
looked around and she was obliged to join them 
mr elton was still talking still engaged in some interesting detail 
and emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he 
was only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday s 
party at his friend cole s and that she was come in herself for 
the stilton cheese the north wiltshire the butter the cellery 
the beet root and all the dessert 
this would soon have led to something better of course was her 
consoling reflection any thing interests between those who love 
and any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart 
if i could but have kept longer away 
they now walked on together quietly till within view of the vicarage 
pales when a sudden resolution of at least getting harriet into 
the house made her again find something very much amiss about her boot 
and fall behind to arrange it once more she then broke the lace 
off short and dexterously throwing it into a ditch was presently 
obliged to entreat them to stop and acknowledged her inability to 
put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort 
part of my lace is gone said she and i do not know how i am 
to contrive i really am a most troublesome companion to you both 
but i hope i am not often so ill equipped mr elton i must beg 
leave to stop at your house and ask your housekeeper for a bit 
of ribband or string or any thing just to keep my boot on 
mr elton looked all happiness at this proposition and nothing 
could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into 
his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage 
the room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied 
and looking forwards behind it was another with which it immediately 
communicated the door between them was open and emma passed 
into it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most 
comfortable manner she was obliged to leave the door ajar as she 
found it but she fully intended that mr elton should close it 
it was not closed however it still remained ajar but by engaging 
the housekeeper in incessant conversation she hoped to make it 
practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room 
for ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself it could 
be protracted no longer she was then obliged to be finished 
and make her appearance 
the lovers were standing together at one of the windows it had a 
most favourable aspect and for half a minute emma felt the glory 
of having schemed successfully but it would not do he had not 
come to the point he had been most agreeable most delightful 
he had told harriet that he had seen them go by and had purposely 
followed them other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt 
but nothing serious 
cautious very cautious thought emma he advances inch by inch 
and will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure 
still however though every thing had not been accomplished 
by her ingenious device she could not but flatter herself 
that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both 
and must be leading them forward to the great event 
chapter xi 
mr elton must now be left to himself it was no longer in emma s 
power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures 
the coming of her sister s family was so very near at hand 
that first in anticipation and then in reality it became henceforth 
her prime object of interest and during the ten days of their stay 
at hartfield it was not to be expected she did not herself expect 
that any thing beyond occasional fortuitous assistance could 
be afforded by her to the lovers they might advance rapidly 
if they would however they must advance somehow or other whether 
they would or no she hardly wished to have more leisure for them 
there are people who the more you do for them the less they will 
do for themselves 
mr and mrs john knightley from having been longer than usual 
absent from surry were exciting of course rather more than the 
usual interest till this year every long vacation since their 
marriage had been divided between hartfield and donwell abbey 
but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea bathing 
for the children and it was therefore many months since they had 
been seen in a regular way by their surry connexions or seen at all 
by mr woodhouse who could not be induced to get so far as london 
even for poor isabella s sake and who consequently was now most 
nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit 
he thought much of the evils of the journey for her and not a 
little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to 
bring some of the party the last half of the way but his alarms 
were needless the sixteen miles being happily accomplished 
and mr and mrs john knightley their five children and a competent 
number of nursery maids all reaching hartfield in safety 
the bustle and joy of such an arrival the many to be talked to 
welcomed encouraged and variously dispersed and disposed of 
produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne 
under any other because nor have endured much longer even for this 
but the ways of hartfield and the feelings of her father were 
so respected by mrs john knightley that in spite of maternal 
solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones 
and for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance 
all the eating and drinking and sleeping and playing 
which they could possibly wish for without the smallest delay 
the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him 
either in themselves or in any restless attendance on them 
mrs john knightley was a pretty elegant little woman of gentle 
quiet manners and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate 
wrapt up in her family a devoted wife a doating mother 
and so tenderly attached to her father and sister that but for 
these higher ties a warmer love might have seemed impossible 
she could never see a fault in any of them she was not a woman 
of strong understanding or any quickness and with this resemblance 
of her father she inherited also much of his constitution 
was delicate in her own health over careful of that of her children 
had many fears and many nerves and was as fond of her own mr wingfield 
in town as her father could be of mr perry they were alike too 
in a general benevolence of temper and a strong habit of regard 
for every old acquaintance 
mr john knightley was a tall gentleman like and very clever man 
rising in his profession domestic and respectable in his 
private character but with reserved manners which prevented his being 
generally pleasing and capable of being sometimes out of humour 
he was not an ill tempered man not so often unreasonably cross 
as to deserve such a reproach but his temper was not his 
great perfection and indeed with such a worshipping wife 
it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not 
be increased the extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his 
he had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted 
and he could sometimes act an ungracious or say a severe thing 
he was not a great favourite with his fair sister in law nothing 
wrong in him escaped her she was quick in feeling the little 
injuries to isabella which isabella never felt herself 
perhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been 
flattering to isabella s sister but they were only those of a calmly 
kind brother and friend without praise and without blindness 
but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her 
regardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes 
fell into the want of respectful forbearance towards her father 
there he had not always the patience that could have been wished 
mr woodhouse s peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking 
him to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally ill bestowed 
it did not often happen for mr john knightley had really a great 
regard for his father in law and generally a strong sense of what was 
due to him but it was too often for emma s charity especially as 
there was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured 
though the offence came not the beginning however of every visit 
displayed none but the properest feelings and this being of necessity 
so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality 
they had not been long seated and composed when mr woodhouse 
with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh called his daughter s 
attention to the sad change at hartfield since she had been there last 
ah my dear said he poor miss taylor it is a grievous business 
oh yes sir cried she with ready sympathy how you must 
miss her and dear emma too what a dreadful loss to you both 
i have been so grieved for you i could not imagine how you could 
possibly do without her it is a sad change indeed but i hope 
she is pretty well sir 
pretty well my dear i hope pretty well i do not know 
but that the place agrees with her tolerably 
mr john knightley here asked emma quietly whether there were any 
doubts of the air of randalls 
oh no none in the least i never saw mrs weston better in my life 
never looking so well papa is only speaking his own regret 
very much to the honour of both was the handsome reply 
and do you see her sir tolerably often asked isabella 
in the plaintive tone which just suited her father 
mr woodhouse hesitated not near so often my dear as i could wish 
oh papa we have missed seeing them but one entire day since 
they married either in the morning or evening of every day 
excepting one have we seen either mr weston or mrs weston 
and generally both either at randalls or here and as you 
may suppose isabella most frequently here they are very 
very kind in their visits mr weston is really as kind as herself 
papa if you speak in that melancholy way you will be giving 
isabella a false idea of us all every body must be aware that miss 
taylor must be missed but every body ought also to be assured 
that mr and mrs weston do really prevent our missing her by any 
means to the extent we ourselves anticipated which is the exact truth 
just as it should be said mr john knightley and just as i hoped 
it was from your letters her wish of shewing you attention could 
not be doubted and his being a disengaged and social man makes it 
all easy i have been always telling you my love that i had no idea 
of the change being so very material to hartfield as you apprehended 
and now you have emma s account i hope you will be satisfied 
why to be sure said mr woodhouse yes certainly i cannot deny 
that mrs weston poor mrs weston does come and see us pretty often 
but then she is always obliged to go away again 
it would be very hard upon mr weston if she did not papa 
you quite forget poor mr weston 
i think indeed said john knightley pleasantly that mr weston 
has some little claim you and i emma will venture to take the part 
of the poor husband i being a husband and you not being a wife 
the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force 
as for isabella she has been married long enough to see the convenience 
of putting all the mr westons aside as much as she can 
me my love cried his wife hearing and understanding only in part 
are you talking about me i am sure nobody ought to be or can be 
a greater advocate for matrimony than i am and if it had not been 
for the misery of her leaving hartfield i should never have thought 
of miss taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world 
and as to slighting mr weston that excellent mr weston i think 
there is nothing he does not deserve i believe he is one of the 
very best tempered men that ever existed excepting yourself 
and your brother i do not know his equal for temper i shall 
never forget his flying henry s kite for him that very windy day 
last easter and ever since his particular kindness last september 
twelvemonth in writing that note at twelve of the clock at night 
on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at cobham 
i have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor 
a better man in existence if any body can deserve him it must be 
miss taylor 
where is the young man said john knightley has he been here 
on this occasion or has he not 
he has not been here yet replied emma there was a strong 
expectation of his coming soon after the marriage but it ended 
in nothing and i have not heard him mentioned lately 
but you should tell them of the letter my dear said her father 
he wrote a letter to poor mrs weston to congratulate her 
and a very proper handsome letter it was she shewed it to me 
i thought it very well done of him indeed whether it was his own idea 
you know one cannot tell he is but young and his uncle perhaps 
my dear papa he is three and twenty you forget how time passes 
three and twenty is he indeed well i could not have thought it 
and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother well 
time does fly indeed and my memory is very bad however it was 
an exceeding good pretty letter and gave mr and mrs weston 
a great deal of pleasure i remember it was written from weymouth 
and dated sept th and began my dear madam but i forget 
how it went on and it was signed f c weston churchill 
i remember that perfectly 
how very pleasing and proper of him cried the good hearted mrs john 
knightley i have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man 
but how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father 
there is something so shocking in a child s being taken away from his 
parents and natural home i never could comprehend how mr weston 
could part with him to give up one s child i really never 
could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else 
nobody ever did think well of the churchills i fancy 
observed mr john knightley coolly but you need not imagine 
mr weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up henry 
or john mr weston is rather an easy cheerful tempered man 
than a man of strong feelings he takes things as he finds them 
and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other depending i suspect 
much more upon what is called society for his comforts that is 
upon the power of eating and drinking and playing whist with his 
neighbours five times a week than upon family affection or any 
thing that home affords 
emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on mr weston 
and had half a mind to take it up but she struggled and let 
it pass she would keep the peace if possible and there was 
something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits 
the all sufficiency of home to himself whence resulted her brother s 
disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse 
and those to whom it was important it had a high claim to forbearance 
chapter xii 
mr knightley was to dine with them rather against the inclination 
of mr woodhouse who did not like that any one should share with him 
in isabella s first day emma s sense of right however had decided it 
and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother 
she had particular pleasure from the circumstance of the late 
disagreement between mr knightley and herself in procuring him 
the proper invitation 
she hoped they might now become friends again she thought it 
was time to make up making up indeed would not do she certainly 
had not been in the wrong and he would never own that he had 
concession must be out of the question but it was time to appear 
to forget that they had ever quarrelled and she hoped it might rather 
assist the restoration of friendship that when he came into the room 
she had one of the children with her the youngest a nice little girl 
about eight months old who was now making her first visit to hartfield 
and very happy to be danced about in her aunt s arms it did assist 
for though he began with grave looks and short questions he was soon 
led on to talk of them all in the usual way and to take the child 
out of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity 
emma felt they were friends again and the conviction giving 
her at first great satisfaction and then a little sauciness 
she could not help saying as he was admiring the baby 
what a comfort it is that we think alike about our nephews and nieces 
as to men and women our opinions are sometimes very different 
but with regard to these children i observe we never disagree 
if you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men 
and women and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your 
dealings with them as you are where these children are concerned 
we might always think alike 
to be sure our discordancies must always arise from my being 
in the wrong 
yes said he smiling and reason good i was sixteen years 
old when you were born 
a material difference then she replied and no doubt you were 
much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives but does 
not the lapse of one and twenty years bring our understandings 
a good deal nearer 
yes a good deal nearer 
but still not near enough to give me a chance of being right 
if we think differently 
i have still the advantage of you by sixteen years experience and by 
not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child come my dear emma 
let us be friends and say no more about it tell your aunt little emma 
that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing 
old grievances and that if she were not wrong before she is now 
that is true she cried very true little emma grow up 
a better woman than your aunt be infinitely cleverer and not 
half so conceited now mr knightley a word or two more and i 
have done as far as good intentions went we were both right 
and i must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet 
proved wrong i only want to know that mr martin is not very 
very bitterly disappointed 
a man cannot be more so was his short full answer 
ah indeed i am very sorry come shake hands with me 
this had just taken place and with great cordiality when john 
knightley made his appearance and how d ye do george and john 
how are you succeeded in the true english style burying under 
a calmness that seemed all but indifference the real attachment 
which would have led either of them if requisite to do every thing 
for the good of the other 
the evening was quiet and conversable as mr woodhouse declined 
cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his 
dear isabella and the little party made two natural divisions 
on one side he and his daughter on the other the two mr knightleys 
their subjects totally distinct or very rarely mixing and emma 
only occasionally joining in one or the other 
the brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits but principally 
of those of the elder whose temper was by much the most communicative 
and who was always the greater talker as a magistrate he had 
generally some point of law to consult john about or at least 
some curious anecdote to give and as a farmer as keeping in hand 
the home farm at donwell he had to tell what every field was to bear 
next year and to give all such local information as could not fail 
of being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been 
the longest part of his life and whose attachments were strong 
the plan of a drain the change of a fence the felling of a tree 
and the destination of every acre for wheat turnips or spring corn 
was entered into with as much equality of interest by john as his 
cooler manners rendered possible and if his willing brother ever 
left him any thing to inquire about his inquiries even approached 
a tone of eagerness 
while they were thus comfortably occupied mr woodhouse was enjoying 
a full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter 
my poor dear isabella said he fondly taking her hand 
and interrupting for a few moments her busy labours for some one 
of her five children how long it is how terribly long since you 
were here and how tired you must be after your journey you must 
go to bed early my dear and i recommend a little gruel to you 
before you go you and i will have a nice basin of gruel together 
my dear emma suppose we all have a little gruel 
emma could not suppose any such thing knowing as she did 
that both the mr knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article 
as herself and two basins only were ordered after a little 
more discourse in praise of gruel with some wondering at its 
not being taken every evening by every body he proceeded to say 
with an air of grave reflection 
it was an awkward business my dear your spending the autumn 
at south end instead of coming here i never had much opinion 
of the sea air 
mr wingfield most strenuously recommended it sir or we 
should not have gone he recommended it for all the children 
but particularly for the weakness in little bella s throat 
both sea air and bathing 
ah my dear but perry had many doubts about the sea doing her 
any good and as to myself i have been long perfectly convinced 
though perhaps i never told you so before that the sea is very 
rarely of use to any body i am sure it almost killed me once 
come come cried emma feeling this to be an unsafe subject i must 
beg you not to talk of the sea it makes me envious and miserable 
i who have never seen it south end is prohibited if you please 
my dear isabella i have not heard you make one inquiry about 
mr perry yet and he never forgets you 
oh good mr perry how is he sir 
why pretty well but not quite well poor perry is bilious 
and he has not time to take care of himself he tells me he has 
not time to take care of himself which is very sad but he is 
always wanted all round the country i suppose there is not a man 
in such practice anywhere but then there is not so clever a man 
any where 
and mrs perry and the children how are they do the children grow 
i have a great regard for mr perry i hope he will be calling soon 
he will be so pleased to see my little ones 
i hope he will be here to morrow for i have a question or two to ask 
him about myself of some consequence and my dear whenever he comes 
you had better let him look at little bella s throat 
oh my dear sir her throat is so much better that i have hardly 
any uneasiness about it either bathing has been of the greatest 
service to her or else it is to be attributed to an excellent 
embrocation of mr wingfield s which we have been applying 
at times ever since august 
it is not very likely my dear that bathing should have been 
of use to her and if i had known you were wanting an embrocation 
i would have spoken to 
you seem to me to have forgotten mrs and miss bates said emma 
i have not heard one inquiry after them 
oh the good bateses i am quite ashamed of myself but you 
mention them in most of your letters i hope they are quite well 
good old mrs bates i will call upon her to morrow and take 
my children they are always so pleased to see my children 
and that excellent miss bates such thorough worthy people 
how are they sir 
why pretty well my dear upon the whole but poor mrs bates 
had a bad cold about a month ago 
how sorry i am but colds were never so prevalent as they have been 
this autumn mr wingfield told me that he has never known them 
more general or heavy except when it has been quite an influenza 
that has been a good deal the case my dear but not to the degree 
you mention perry says that colds have been very general 
but not so heavy as he has very often known them in november 
perry does not call it altogether a sickly season 
no i do not know that mr wingfield considers it very sickly except 
ah my poor dear child the truth is that in london it is always 
a sickly season nobody is healthy in london nobody can be 
it is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there so far off 
and the air so bad 
no indeed we are not at all in a bad air our part of london is 
very superior to most others you must not confound us with london 
in general my dear sir the neighbourhood of brunswick square 
is very different from almost all the rest we are so very airy 
i should be unwilling i own to live in any other part of the town 
there is hardly any other that i could be satisfied to have my 
children in but we are so remarkably airy mr wingfield thinks 
the vicinity of brunswick square decidedly the most favourable as 
to air 
ah my dear it is not like hartfield you make the best of it 
but after you have been a week at hartfield you are all of you 
different creatures you do not look like the same now i cannot say 
that i think you are any of you looking well at present 
i am sorry to hear you say so sir but i assure you excepting those 
little nervous head aches and palpitations which i am never entirely 
free from anywhere i am quite well myself and if the children were 
rather pale before they went to bed it was only because they were 
a little more tired than usual from their journey and the happiness 
of coming i hope you will think better of their looks to morrow 
for i assure you mr wingfield told me that he did not believe 
he had ever sent us off altogether in such good case i trust 
at least that you do not think mr knightley looking ill 
turning her eyes with affectionate anxiety towards her husband 
middling my dear i cannot compliment you i think mr john 
knightley very far from looking well 
what is the matter sir did you speak to me cried mr john 
knightley hearing his own name 
i am sorry to find my love that my father does not think you 
looking well but i hope it is only from being a little fatigued 
i could have wished however as you know that you had seen 
mr wingfield before you left home 
my dear isabella exclaimed he hastily pray do not concern 
yourself about my looks be satisfied with doctoring and coddling 
yourself and the children and let me look as i chuse 
i did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother 
cried emma about your friend mr graham s intending to have a bailiff 
from scotland to look after his new estate what will it answer 
will not the old prejudice be too strong 
and she talked in this way so long and successfully that when forced 
to give her attention again to her father and sister she had nothing 
worse to hear than isabella s kind inquiry after jane fairfax 
and jane fairfax though no great favourite with her in general 
she was at that moment very happy to assist in praising 
that sweet amiable jane fairfax said mrs john knightley 
it is so long since i have seen her except now and then for a moment 
accidentally in town what happiness it must be to her good old 
grandmother and excellent aunt when she comes to visit them 
i always regret excessively on dear emma s account that she cannot 
be more at highbury but now their daughter is married i suppose 
colonel and mrs campbell will not be able to part with her at all 
she would be such a delightful companion for emma 
mr woodhouse agreed to it all but added 
our little friend harriet smith however is just such another 
pretty kind of young person you will like harriet emma could 
not have a better companion than harriet 
i am most happy to hear it but only jane fairfax one knows to be 
so very accomplished and superior and exactly emma s age 
this topic was discussed very happily and others succeeded of 
similar moment and passed away with similar harmony but the evening 
did not close without a little return of agitation the gruel came 
and supplied a great deal to be said much praise and many comments 
undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution 
and pretty severe philippics upon the many houses where it was 
never met with tolerable but unfortunately among the failures 
which the daughter had to instance the most recent and therefore 
most prominent was in her own cook at south end a young woman 
hired for the time who never had been able to understand what she 
meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel thin but not too thin 
often as she had wished for and ordered it she had never been able 
to get any thing tolerable here was a dangerous opening 
ah said mr woodhouse shaking his head and fixing his eyes on 
her with tender concern the ejaculation in emma s ear expressed 
ah there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to 
south end it does not bear talking of and for a little while 
she hoped he would not talk of it and that a silent rumination 
might suffice to restore him to the relish of his own smooth gruel 
after an interval of some minutes however he began with 
i shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn 
instead of coming here 
but why should you be sorry sir i assure you it did the children 
a great deal of good 
and moreover if you must go to the sea it had better not 
have been to south end south end is an unhealthy place 
perry was surprized to hear you had fixed upon south end 
i know there is such an idea with many people but indeed it is 
quite a mistake sir we all had our health perfectly well there 
never found the least inconvenience from the mud and mr wingfield 
says it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy 
and i am sure he may be depended on for he thoroughly understands 
the nature of the air and his own brother and family have been 
there repeatedly 
you should have gone to cromer my dear if you went anywhere 
perry was a week at cromer once and he holds it to be the best 
of all the sea bathing places a fine open sea he says and very 
pure air and by what i understand you might have had lodgings there 
quite away from the sea a quarter of a mile off very comfortable 
you should have consulted perry 
but my dear sir the difference of the journey only consider how 
great it would have been an hundred miles perhaps instead of forty 
ah my dear as perry says where health is at stake nothing else 
should be considered and if one is to travel there is not much 
to chuse between forty miles and an hundred better not move at all 
better stay in london altogether than travel forty miles to get 
into a worse air this is just what perry said it seemed to him 
a very ill judged measure 
emma s attempts to stop her father had been vain and when he 
had reached such a point as this she could not wonder at her 
brother in law s breaking out 
mr perry said he in a voice of very strong displeasure 
would do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for 
why does he make it any business of his to wonder at what i do 
at my taking my family to one part of the coast or another i may 
be allowed i hope the use of my judgment as well as mr perry 
i want his directions no more than his drugs he paused 
and growing cooler in a moment added with only sarcastic dryness 
if mr perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children 
a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense 
or inconvenience than a distance of forty i should be as willing to 
prefer cromer to south end as he could himself 
true true cried mr knightley with most ready interposition 
very true that is a consideration indeed but john as to what i 
was telling you of my idea of moving the path to langham of turning 
it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows 
i cannot conceive any difficulty i should not attempt it 
if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the highbury people 
but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path 
the only way of proving it however will be to turn to our maps 
i shall see you at the abbey to morrow morning i hope and then we 
will look them over and you shall give me your opinion 
mr woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on 
his friend perry to whom he had in fact though unconsciously 
been attributing many of his own feelings and expressions 
but the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed 
the present evil and the immediate alertness of one brother 
and better recollections of the other prevented any renewal of it 
chapter xiii 
there could hardly be a happier creature in the world than mrs john 
knightley in this short visit to hartfield going about every morning 
among her old acquaintance with her five children and talking 
over what she had done every evening with her father and sister 
she had nothing to wish otherwise but that the days did not pass 
so swiftly it was a delightful visit perfect in being much too short 
in general their evenings were less engaged with friends than 
their mornings but one complete dinner engagement and out 
of the house too there was no avoiding though at christmas 
mr weston would take no denial they must all dine at randalls 
one day even mr woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible 
thing in preference to a division of the party 
how they were all to be conveyed he would have made a difficulty 
if he could but as his son and daughter s carriage and horses 
were actually at hartfield he was not able to make more than 
a simple question on that head it hardly amounted to a doubt 
nor did it occupy emma long to convince him that they might in one 
of the carriages find room for harriet also 
harriet mr elton and mr knightley their own especial set 
were the only persons invited to meet them the hours were to be early 
as well as the numbers few mr woodhouse s habits and inclination 
being consulted in every thing 
the evening before this great event for it was a very great event 
that mr woodhouse should dine out on the th of december had been 
spent by harriet at hartfield and she had gone home so much indisposed 
with a cold that but for her own earnest wish of being nursed 
by mrs goddard emma could not have allowed her to leave the house 
emma called on her the next day and found her doom already signed 
with regard to randalls she was very feverish and had a bad 
sore throat mrs goddard was full of care and affection mr perry 
was talked of and harriet herself was too ill and low to resist 
the authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement 
though she could not speak of her loss without many tears 
emma sat with her as long as she could to attend her in mrs goddard s 
unavoidable absences and raise her spirits by representing how much 
mr elton s would be depressed when he knew her state and left her 
at last tolerably comfortable in the sweet dependence of his having 
a most comfortless visit and of their all missing her very much 
she had not advanced many yards from mrs goddard s door when she 
was met by mr elton himself evidently coming towards it and as 
they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid 
of whom he on the rumour of considerable illness had been going 
to inquire that he might carry some report of her to hartfield 
they were overtaken by mr john knightley returning from the 
daily visit to donwell with his two eldest boys whose healthy 
glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run and seemed 
to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they 
were hastening home for they joined company and proceeded together 
emma was just describing the nature of her friend s complaint 
a throat very much inflamed with a great deal of heat about her 
a quick low pulse c and she was sorry to find from mrs goddard 
that harriet was liable to very bad sore throats and had often 
alarmed her with them mr elton looked all alarm on the occasion 
as he exclaimed 
a sore throat i hope not infectious i hope not of a putrid 
infectious sort has perry seen her indeed you should take care 
of yourself as well as of your friend let me entreat you to run 
no risks why does not perry see her 
emma who was not really at all frightened herself tranquillised this 
excess of apprehension by assurances of mrs goddard s experience 
and care but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness 
which she could not wish to reason away which she would rather 
feed and assist than not she added soon afterwards as if quite 
another subject 
it is so cold so very cold and looks and feels so very much 
like snow that if it were to any other place or with any other party 
i should really try not to go out to day and dissuade my father 
from venturing but as he has made up his mind and does not seem 
to feel the cold himself i do not like to interfere as i know it 
would be so great a disappointment to mr and mrs weston but upon 
my word mr elton in your case i should certainly excuse myself 
you appear to me a little hoarse already and when you consider 
what demand of voice and what fatigues to morrow will bring 
i think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home 
and take care of yourself to night 
mr elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make 
which was exactly the case for though very much gratified by the kind 
care of such a fair lady and not liking to resist any advice of 
her s he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit 
but emma too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions 
and views to hear him impartially or see him with clear vision 
was very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its 
being very cold certainly very cold and walked on rejoicing in 
having extricated him from randalls and secured him the power 
of sending to inquire after harriet every hour of the evening 
you do quite right said she we will make your apologies 
to mr and mrs weston 
but hardly had she so spoken when she found her brother was civilly 
offering a seat in his carriage if the weather were mr elton s 
only objection and mr elton actually accepting the offer with much 
prompt satisfaction it was a done thing mr elton was to go 
and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than 
at this moment never had his smile been stronger nor his eyes 
more exulting than when he next looked at her 
well said she to herself this is most strange after i 
had got him off so well to chuse to go into company and leave 
harriet ill behind most strange indeed but there is i believe 
in many men especially single men such an inclination 
such a passion for dining out a dinner engagement is so high in 
the class of their pleasures their employments their dignities 
almost their duties that any thing gives way to it and this must 
be the case with mr elton a most valuable amiable pleasing young 
man undoubtedly and very much in love with harriet but still 
he cannot refuse an invitation he must dine out wherever he is asked 
what a strange thing love is he can see ready wit in harriet 
but will not dine alone for her 
soon afterwards mr elton quitted them and she could not but do him 
the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment 
in his manner of naming harriet at parting in the tone of his 
voice while assuring her that he should call at mrs goddard s 
for news of her fair friend the last thing before he prepared 
for the happiness of meeting her again when he hoped to be 
able to give a better report and he sighed and smiled himself 
off in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his favour 
after a few minutes of entire silence between them john knightley 
began with 
i never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than 
mr elton it is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned 
with men he can be rational and unaffected but when he has ladies 
to please every feature works 
mr elton s manners are not perfect replied emma but where there 
is a wish to please one ought to overlook and one does overlook 
a great deal where a man does his best with only moderate powers 
he will have the advantage over negligent superiority there is 
such perfect good temper and good will in mr elton as one cannot 
but value 
yes said mr john knightley presently with some slyness 
he seems to have a great deal of good will towards you 
me she replied with a smile of astonishment are you imagining 
me to be mr elton s object 
such an imagination has crossed me i own emma and if it never 
occurred to you before you may as well take it into consideration now 
mr elton in love with me what an idea 
i do not say it is so but you will do well to consider whether 
it is so or not and to regulate your behaviour accordingly 
i think your manners to him encouraging i speak as a friend 
emma you had better look about you and ascertain what you do 
and what you mean to do 
i thank you but i assure you you are quite mistaken mr elton 
and i are very good friends and nothing more and she walked on 
amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often 
arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances of the mistakes 
which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into 
and not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind 
and ignorant and in want of counsel he said no more 
mr woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit 
that in spite of the increasing coldness he seemed to have no idea 
of shrinking from it and set forward at last most punctually 
with his eldest daughter in his own carriage with less apparent 
consciousness of the weather than either of the others too full 
of the wonder of his own going and the pleasure it was to afford at 
randalls to see that it was cold and too well wrapt up to feel it 
the cold however was severe and by the time the second carriage 
was in motion a few flakes of snow were finding their way down 
and the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only 
a milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time 
emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour 
the preparing and the going abroad in such weather with the sacrifice 
of his children after dinner were evils were disagreeables at least 
which mr john knightley did not by any means like he anticipated 
nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase 
and the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in 
expressing his discontent 
a man said he must have a very good opinion of himself when 
he asks people to leave their own fireside and encounter such 
a day as this for the sake of coming to see him he must think 
himself a most agreeable fellow i could not do such a thing 
it is the greatest absurdity actually snowing at this moment 
the folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home and the 
folly of people s not staying comfortably at home when they can 
if we were obliged to go out such an evening as this by any call of 
duty or business what a hardship we should deem it and here are we 
probably with rather thinner clothing than usual setting forward 
voluntarily without excuse in defiance of the voice of nature 
which tells man in every thing given to his view or his feelings 
to stay at home himself and keep all under shelter that he can 
here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another 
man s house with nothing to say or to hear that was not said 
and heard yesterday and may not be said and heard again to morrow 
going in dismal weather to return probably in worse four horses 
and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle 
shivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they 
might have had at home 
emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent which no doubt 
he was in the habit of receiving to emulate the very true my love 
which must have been usually administered by his travelling companion 
but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer 
at all she could not be complying she dreaded being quarrelsome 
her heroism reached only to silence she allowed him to talk 
and arranged the glasses and wrapped herself up without opening 
her lips 
they arrived the carriage turned the step was let down 
and mr elton spruce black and smiling was with them instantly 
emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject mr elton 
was all obligation and cheerfulness he was so very cheerful 
in his civilities indeed that she began to think he must have 
received a different account of harriet from what had reached her 
she had sent while dressing and the answer had been much the same 
not better 
my report from mrs goddard s said she presently was not 
so pleasant as i had hoped not better was my answer 
his face lengthened immediately and his voice was the voice 
of sentiment as he answered 
oh no i am grieved to find i was on the point of telling you that 
when i called at mrs goddard s door which i did the very last thing 
before i returned to dress i was told that miss smith was not better 
by no means better rather worse very much grieved and concerned 
i had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial 
as i knew had been given her in the morning 
emma smiled and answered my visit was of use to the nervous part 
of her complaint i hope but not even i can charm away a sore throat 
it is a most severe cold indeed mr perry has been with her 
as you probably heard 
yes i imagined that is i did not 
he has been used to her in these complaints and i hope to morrow 
morning will bring us both a more comfortable report but it is 
impossible not to feel uneasiness such a sad loss to our party to day 
dreadful exactly so indeed she will be missed every moment 
this was very proper the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable 
but it should have lasted longer emma was rather in dismay when 
only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things 
and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment 
what an excellent device said he the use of a sheepskin 
for carriages how very comfortable they make it impossible to 
feel cold with such precautions the contrivances of modern days 
indeed have rendered a gentleman s carriage perfectly complete 
one is so fenced and guarded from the weather that not a breath 
of air can find its way unpermitted weather becomes absolutely 
of no consequence it is a very cold afternoon but in this carriage 
we know nothing of the matter ha snows a little i see 
yes said john knightley and i think we shall have a good deal 
of it 
christmas weather observed mr elton quite seasonable 
and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not 
begin yesterday and prevent this day s party which it might very 
possibly have done for mr woodhouse would hardly have ventured had 
there been much snow on the ground but now it is of no consequence 
this is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings at christmas 
every body invites their friends about them and people think little 
of even the worst weather i was snowed up at a friend s house once 
for a week nothing could be pleasanter i went for only one night 
and could not get away till that very day se nnight 
mr john knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure 
but said only coolly 
i cannot wish to be snowed up a week at randalls 
at another time emma might have been amused but she was too 
much astonished now at mr elton s spirits for other feelings 
harriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party 
we are sure of excellent fires continued he and every thing 
in the greatest comfort charming people mr and mrs weston 
mrs weston indeed is much beyond praise and he is exactly 
what one values so hospitable and so fond of society 
it will be a small party but where small parties are select 
they are perhaps the most agreeable of any mr weston s dining room 
does not accommodate more than ten comfortably and for my part 
i would rather under such circumstances fall short by two than 
exceed by two i think you will agree with me turning with a soft 
air to emma i think i shall certainly have your approbation 
though mr knightley perhaps from being used to the large parties 
of london may not quite enter into our feelings 
i know nothing of the large parties of london sir i never dine 
with any body 
indeed in a tone of wonder and pity i had no idea that the 
law had been so great a slavery well sir the time must come 
when you will be paid for all this when you will have little 
labour and great enjoyment 
my first enjoyment replied john knightley as they passed through 
the sweep gate will be to find myself safe at hartfield again 
chapter xiv 
some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman 
as they walked into mrs weston s drawing room mr elton must 
compose his joyous looks and mr john knightley disperse his 
ill humour mr elton must smile less and mr john knightley more 
to fit them for the place emma only might be as nature prompted 
and shew herself just as happy as she was to her it was real 
enjoyment to be with the westons mr weston was a great favourite 
and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with 
such unreserve as to his wife not any one to whom she related 
with such conviction of being listened to and understood of being 
always interesting and always intelligible the little affairs 
arrangements perplexities and pleasures of her father and herself 
she could tell nothing of hartfield in which mrs weston had not 
a lively concern and half an hour s uninterrupted communication 
of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private 
life depends was one of the first gratifications of each 
this was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day s visit might 
not afford which certainly did not belong to the present half hour 
but the very sight of mrs weston her smile her touch her voice 
was grateful to emma and she determined to think as little as 
possible of mr elton s oddities or of any thing else unpleasant 
and enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost 
the misfortune of harriet s cold had been pretty well gone through 
before her arrival mr woodhouse had been safely seated long 
enough to give the history of it besides all the history of his own 
and isabella s coming and of emma s being to follow and had indeed 
just got to the end of his satisfaction that james should come 
and see his daughter when the others appeared and mrs weston 
who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him 
was able to turn away and welcome her dear emma 
emma s project of forgetting mr elton for a while made her rather 
sorry to find when they had all taken their places that he was 
close to her the difficulty was great of driving his strange 
insensibility towards harriet from her mind while he not only sat 
at her elbow but was continually obtruding his happy countenance 
on her notice and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion 
instead of forgetting him his behaviour was such that she could 
not avoid the internal suggestion of can it really be as my brother 
imagined can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer 
his affections from harriet to me absurd and insufferable 
yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm would be 
so interested about her father and so delighted with mrs weston 
and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal 
and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would be lover 
and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners 
for her own sake she could not be rude and for harriet s in the hope 
that all would yet turn out right she was even positively civil 
but it was an effort especially as something was going on amongst 
the others in the most overpowering period of mr elton s nonsense 
which she particularly wished to listen to she heard enough 
to know that mr weston was giving some information about his son 
she heard the words my son and frank and my son 
repeated several times over and from a few other half syllables 
very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from 
his son but before she could quiet mr elton the subject was 
so completely past that any reviving question from her would have 
been awkward 
now it so happened that in spite of emma s resolution of never marrying 
there was something in the name in the idea of mr frank churchill 
which always interested her she had frequently thought especially since 
his father s marriage with miss taylor that if she were to marry 
he was the very person to suit her in age character and condition 
he seemed by this connexion between the families quite to belong to her 
she could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew 
them must think of that mr and mrs weston did think of it she was 
very strongly persuaded and though not meaning to be induced by him 
or by any body else to give up a situation which she believed more 
replete with good than any she could change it for she had a great 
curiosity to see him a decided intention of finding him pleasant 
of being liked by him to a certain degree and a sort of pleasure 
in the idea of their being coupled in their friends imaginations 
with such sensations mr elton s civilities were dreadfully ill timed 
but she had the comfort of appearing very polite while feeling 
very cross and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not 
possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again 
or the substance of it from the open hearted mr weston so it proved 
for when happily released from mr elton and seated by mr weston 
at dinner he made use of the very first interval in the cares 
of hospitality the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton 
to say to her 
we want only two more to be just the right number i should 
like to see two more here your pretty little friend miss smith 
and my son and then i should say we were quite complete 
i believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing room 
that we are expecting frank i had a letter from him this morning 
and he will be with us within a fortnight 
emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure and fully assented 
to his proposition of mr frank churchill and miss smith making 
their party quite complete 
he has been wanting to come to us continued mr weston 
ever since september every letter has been full of it 
but he cannot command his own time he has those to please 
who must be pleased and who between ourselves are sometimes 
to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices but now 
i have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in january 
what a very great pleasure it will be to you and mrs weston 
is so anxious to be acquainted with him that she must be almost 
as happy as yourself 
yes she would be but that she thinks there will be another 
put off she does not depend upon his coming so much as i do 
but she does not know the parties so well as i do the case 
you see is but this is quite between ourselves i did not mention 
a syllable of it in the other room there are secrets in all families 
you know the case is that a party of friends are invited to pay 
a visit at enscombe in january and that frank s coming depends upon 
their being put off if they are not put off he cannot stir 
but i know they will because it is a family that a certain lady 
of some consequence at enscombe has a particular dislike to 
and though it is thought necessary to invite them once in two or 
three years they always are put off when it comes to the point 
i have not the smallest doubt of the issue i am as confident 
of seeing frank here before the middle of january as i am 
of being here myself but your good friend there nodding 
towards the upper end of the table has so few vagaries herself 
and has been so little used to them at hartfield that she cannot 
calculate on their effects as i have been long in the practice 
of doing 
i am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case 
replied emma but am disposed to side with you mr weston if you 
think he will come i shall think so too for you know enscombe 
yes i have some right to that knowledge though i have never been 
at the place in my life she is an odd woman but i never allow 
myself to speak ill of her on frank s account for i do believe 
her to be very fond of him i used to think she was not capable 
of being fond of any body except herself but she has always been 
kind to him in her way allowing for little whims and caprices 
and expecting every thing to be as she likes and it is no small credit 
in my opinion to him that he should excite such an affection 
for though i would not say it to any body else she has no more 
heart than a stone to people in general and the devil of a temper 
emma liked the subject so well that she began upon it to mrs weston 
very soon after their moving into the drawing room wishing her joy 
yet observing that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming 
mrs weston agreed to it but added that she should be very 
glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting 
at the time talked of for i cannot depend upon his coming 
i cannot be so sanguine as mr weston i am very much afraid 
that it will all end in nothing mr weston i dare say has been 
telling you exactly how the matter stands 
yes it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill humour 
of mrs churchill which i imagine to be the most certain 
thing in the world 
my emma replied mrs weston smiling what is the certainty 
of caprice then turning to isabella who had not been 
attending before you must know my dear mrs knightley 
that we are by no means so sure of seeing mr frank churchill 
in my opinion as his father thinks it depends entirely upon 
his aunt s spirits and pleasure in short upon her temper 
to you to my two daughters i may venture on the truth 
mrs churchill rules at enscombe and is a very odd tempered woman 
and his coming now depends upon her being willing to spare him 
oh mrs churchill every body knows mrs churchill 
replied isabella and i am sure i never think of that poor young 
man without the greatest compassion to be constantly living 
with an ill tempered person must be dreadful it is what we 
happily have never known any thing of but it must be a life 
of misery what a blessing that she never had any children 
poor little creatures how unhappy she would have made them 
emma wished she had been alone with mrs weston she should then have 
heard more mrs weston would speak to her with a degree of unreserve 
which she would not hazard with isabella and she really believed 
would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the churchills 
from her excepting those views on the young man of which her own 
imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge 
but at present there was nothing more to be said mr woodhouse 
very soon followed them into the drawing room to be sitting 
long after dinner was a confinement that he could not endure 
neither wine nor conversation was any thing to him and gladly did 
he move to those with whom he was always comfortable 
while he talked to isabella however emma found an opportunity 
of saying 
and so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any 
means certain i am sorry for it the introduction must be unpleasant 
whenever it takes place and the sooner it could be over the better 
yes and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays 
even if this family the braithwaites are put off i am still 
afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us 
i cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side but i am sure 
there is a great wish on the churchills to keep him to themselves 
there is jealousy they are jealous even of his regard for his father 
in short i can feel no dependence on his coming and i wish mr weston 
were less sanguine 
he ought to come said emma if he could stay only a couple 
of days he ought to come and one can hardly conceive a young man s 
not having it in his power to do as much as that a young woman 
if she fall into bad hands may be teazed and kept at a distance 
from those she wants to be with but one cannot comprehend a young 
man s being under such restraint as not to be able to spend a week 
with his father if he likes it 
one ought to be at enscombe and know the ways of the family 
before one decides upon what he can do replied mrs weston 
one ought to use the same caution perhaps in judging of the 
conduct of any one individual of any one family but enscombe 
i believe certainly must not be judged by general rules 
she is so very unreasonable and every thing gives way to her 
but she is so fond of the nephew he is so very great a favourite 
now according to my idea of mrs churchill it would be most natural 
that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband 
to whom she owes every thing while she exercises incessant caprice 
towards him she should frequently be governed by the nephew 
to whom she owes nothing at all 
my dearest emma do not pretend with your sweet temper 
to understand a bad one or to lay down rules for it you must 
let it go its own way i have no doubt of his having at times 
considerable influence but it may be perfectly impossible for him 
to know beforehand when it will be 
emma listened and then coolly said i shall not be satisfied 
unless he comes 
he may have a great deal of influence on some points 
continued mrs weston and on others very little and among those 
on which she is beyond his reach it is but too likely may be 
this very circumstance of his coming away from them to visit us 
chapter xv 
mr woodhouse was soon ready for his tea and when he had drank his 
tea he was quite ready to go home and it was as much as his three 
companions could do to entertain away his notice of the lateness 
of the hour before the other gentlemen appeared mr weston was 
chatty and convivial and no friend to early separations of any sort 
but at last the drawing room party did receive an augmentation 
mr elton in very good spirits was one of the first to walk in 
mrs weston and emma were sitting together on a sofa he joined 
them immediately and with scarcely an invitation seated himself 
between them 
emma in good spirits too from the amusement afforded her mind 
by the expectation of mr frank churchill was willing to forget 
his late improprieties and be as well satisfied with him as before 
and on his making harriet his very first subject was ready to listen 
with most friendly smiles 
he professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend 
her fair lovely amiable friend did she know had she 
heard any thing about her since their being at randalls 
he felt much anxiety he must confess that the nature of her 
complaint alarmed him considerably and in this style he talked 
on for some time very properly not much attending to any answer 
but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat 
and emma was quite in charity with him 
but at last there seemed a perverse turn it seemed all at once as if 
he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account 
than on harriet s more anxious that she should escape the infection 
than that there should be no infection in the complaint he began 
with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting 
the sick chamber again for the present to entreat her to promise 
him not to venture into such hazard till he had seen mr perry 
and learnt his opinion and though she tried to laugh it off 
and bring the subject back into its proper course there was no 
putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her she was vexed 
it did appear there was no concealing it exactly like the pretence 
of being in love with her instead of harriet an inconstancy 
if real the most contemptible and abominable and she had difficulty 
in behaving with temper he turned to mrs weston to implore 
her assistance would not she give him her support would not she 
add her persuasions to his to induce miss woodhouse not to go 
to mrs goddard s till it were certain that miss smith s disorder 
had no infection he could not be satisfied without a promise 
would not she give him her influence in procuring it 
so scrupulous for others he continued and yet so careless 
for herself she wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to day 
and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated 
sore throat herself is this fair mrs weston judge between us 
have not i some right to complain i am sure of your kind support 
and aid 
emma saw mrs weston s surprize and felt that it must be great 
at an address which in words and manner was assuming to himself 
the right of first interest in her and as for herself she was 
too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly 
saying any thing to the purpose she could only give him a look 
but it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses 
and then left the sofa removing to a seat by her sister and giving 
her all her attention 
she had not time to know how mr elton took the reproof so rapidly 
did another subject succeed for mr john knightley now came 
into the room from examining the weather and opened on them 
all with the information of the ground being covered with snow 
and of its still snowing fast with a strong drifting wind 
concluding with these words to mr woodhouse 
this will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements 
sir something new for your coachman and horses to be making 
their way through a storm of snow 
poor mr woodhouse was silent from consternation but every body else 
had something to say every body was either surprized or not surprized 
and had some question to ask or some comfort to offer mrs weston 
and emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention 
from his son in law who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly 
i admired your resolution very much sir said he in venturing 
out in such weather for of course you saw there would be snow 
very soon every body must have seen the snow coming on 
i admired your spirit and i dare say we shall get home very well 
another hour or two s snow can hardly make the road impassable 
and we are two carriages if one is blown over in the bleak part 
of the common field there will be the other at hand i dare say we 
shall be all safe at hartfield before midnight 
mr weston with triumph of a different sort was confessing that he 
had known it to be snowing some time but had not said a word 
lest it should make mr woodhouse uncomfortable and be an excuse 
for his hurrying away as to there being any quantity of snow fallen 
or likely to fall to impede their return that was a mere joke 
he was afraid they would find no difficulty he wished the road might 
be impassable that he might be able to keep them all at randalls 
and with the utmost good will was sure that accommodation might 
be found for every body calling on his wife to agree with him 
that with a little contrivance every body might be lodged 
which she hardly knew how to do from the consciousness of there 
being but two spare rooms in the house 
what is to be done my dear emma what is to be done 
was mr woodhouse s first exclamation and all that he could say 
for some time to her he looked for comfort and her assurances 
of safety her representation of the excellence of the horses 
and of james and of their having so many friends about them 
revived him a little 
his eldest daughter s alarm was equal to his own the horror of 
being blocked up at randalls while her children were at hartfield 
was full in her imagination and fancying the road to be now just 
passable for adventurous people but in a state that admitted no delay 
she was eager to have it settled that her father and emma should remain 
at randalls while she and her husband set forward instantly through 
all the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them 
you had better order the carriage directly my love said she 
i dare say we shall be able to get along if we set off directly 
and if we do come to any thing very bad i can get out and walk 
i am not at all afraid i should not mind walking half the way 
i could change my shoes you know the moment i got home and it is not 
the sort of thing that gives me cold 
indeed replied he then my dear isabella it is the most 
extraordinary sort of thing in the world for in general every 
thing does give you cold walk home you are prettily shod 
for walking home i dare say it will be bad enough for the horses 
isabella turned to mrs weston for her approbation of the plan 
mrs weston could only approve isabella then went to emma 
but emma could not so entirely give up the hope of their being 
all able to get away and they were still discussing the point 
when mr knightley who had left the room immediately after his 
brother s first report of the snow came back again and told them 
that he had been out of doors to examine and could answer for there 
not being the smallest difficulty in their getting home whenever they 
liked it either now or an hour hence he had gone beyond the sweep 
some way along the highbury road the snow was nowhere above half 
an inch deep in many places hardly enough to whiten the ground 
a very few flakes were falling at present but the clouds were parting 
and there was every appearance of its being soon over he had seen 
the coachmen and they both agreed with him in there being nothing 
to apprehend 
to isabella the relief of such tidings was very great and they 
were scarcely less acceptable to emma on her father s account 
who was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous 
constitution allowed but the alarm that had been raised could not 
be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued 
at randalls he was satisfied of there being no present danger in 
returning home but no assurances could convince him that it was safe 
to stay and while the others were variously urging and recommending 
mr knightley and emma settled it in a few brief sentences thus 
your father will not be easy why do not you go 
i am ready if the others are 
shall i ring the bell 
yes do 
and the bell was rung and the carriages spoken for a few 
minutes more and emma hoped to see one troublesome companion 
deposited in his own house to get sober and cool and the other 
recover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over 
the carriage came and mr woodhouse always the first object on 
such occasions was carefully attended to his own by mr knightley 
and mr weston but not all that either could say could prevent some 
renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen 
and the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for 
he was afraid they should have a very bad drive he was afraid 
poor isabella would not like it and there would be poor emma 
in the carriage behind he did not know what they had best do 
they must keep as much together as they could and james was talked to 
and given a charge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage 
isabella stept in after her father john knightley forgetting that he 
did not belong to their party stept in after his wife very naturally 
so that emma found on being escorted and followed into the second 
carriage by mr elton that the door was to be lawfully shut on them 
and that they were to have a tete a tete drive it would not have been 
the awkwardness of a moment it would have been rather a pleasure 
previous to the suspicions of this very day she could have talked 
to him of harriet and the three quarters of a mile would have 
seemed but one but now she would rather it had not happened 
she believed he had been drinking too much of mr weston s good wine 
and felt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense 
to restrain him as much as might be by her own manners she was 
immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity 
of the weather and the night but scarcely had she begun scarcely had 
they passed the sweep gate and joined the other carriage than she 
found her subject cut up her hand seized her attention demanded 
and mr elton actually making violent love to her availing himself 
of the precious opportunity declaring sentiments which must be already 
well known hoping fearing adoring ready to die if she refused him 
but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled 
love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect 
and in short very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon 
as possible it really was so without scruple without apology 
without much apparent diffidence mr elton the lover of harriet 
was professing himself her lover she tried to stop him but vainly 
he would go on and say it all angry as she was the thought of 
the moment made her resolve to restrain herself when she did speak 
she felt that half this folly must be drunkenness and therefore 
could hope that it might belong only to the passing hour 
accordingly with a mixture of the serious and the playful which she 
hoped would best suit his half and half state she replied 
i am very much astonished mr elton this to me you forget yourself 
you take me for my friend any message to miss smith i shall 
be happy to deliver but no more of this to me if you please 
miss smith message to miss smith what could she possibly mean 
and he repeated her words with such assurance of accent such boastful 
pretence of amazement that she could not help replying with quickness 
mr elton this is the most extraordinary conduct and i can account 
for it only in one way you are not yourself or you could not speak 
either to me or of harriet in such a manner command yourself 
enough to say no more and i will endeavour to forget it 
but mr elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits 
not at all to confuse his intellects he perfectly knew his own meaning 
and having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious 
and slightly touched upon his respect for miss smith as her friend 
but acknowledging his wonder that miss smith should be mentioned 
at all he resumed the subject of his own passion and was very 
urgent for a favourable answer 
as she thought less of his inebriety she thought more of his inconstancy 
and presumption and with fewer struggles for politeness replied 
it is impossible for me to doubt any longer you have made 
yourself too clear mr elton my astonishment is much beyond 
any thing i can express after such behaviour as i have witnessed 
during the last month to miss smith such attentions as i 
have been in the daily habit of observing to be addressing me 
in this manner this is an unsteadiness of character indeed 
which i had not supposed possible believe me sir i am far 
very far from gratified in being the object of such professions 
good heaven cried mr elton what can be the meaning of this 
miss smith i never thought of miss smith in the whole course 
of my existence never paid her any attentions but as your friend 
never cared whether she were dead or alive but as your friend 
if she has fancied otherwise her own wishes have misled her 
and i am very sorry extremely sorry but miss smith indeed oh 
miss woodhouse who can think of miss smith when miss woodhouse 
is near no upon my honour there is no unsteadiness of character 
i have thought only of you i protest against having paid the smallest 
attention to any one else every thing that i have said or done 
for many weeks past has been with the sole view of marking my 
adoration of yourself you cannot really seriously doubt it 
no in an accent meant to be insinuating i am sure you have seen 
and understood me 
it would be impossible to say what emma felt on hearing this 
which of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost she was 
too completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply 
and two moments of silence being ample encouragement for mr elton s 
sanguine state of mind he tried to take her hand again as he 
joyously exclaimed 
charming miss woodhouse allow me to interpret this interesting silence 
it confesses that you have long understood me 
no sir cried emma it confesses no such thing so far from 
having long understood you i have been in a most complete error 
with respect to your views till this moment as to myself i am 
very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings 
nothing could be farther from my wishes your attachment to my 
friend harriet your pursuit of her pursuit it appeared gave me 
great pleasure and i have been very earnestly wishing you success 
but had i supposed that she were not your attraction to hartfield 
i should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits 
so frequent am i to believe that you have never sought to recommend 
yourself particularly to miss smith that you have never thought 
seriously of her 
never madam cried he affronted in his turn never i assure you 
i think seriously of miss smith miss smith is a very good sort 
of girl and i should be happy to see her respectably settled 
i wish her extremely well and no doubt there are men who might not 
object to every body has their level but as for myself i am not 
i think quite so much at a loss i need not so totally despair 
of an equal alliance as to be addressing myself to miss smith 
no madam my visits to hartfield have been for yourself only 
and the encouragement i received 
encouragement i give you encouragement sir you have been entirely 
mistaken in supposing it i have seen you only as the admirer 
of my friend in no other light could you have been more to me than 
a common acquaintance i am exceedingly sorry but it is well that 
the mistake ends where it does had the same behaviour continued 
miss smith might have been led into a misconception of your views 
not being aware probably any more than myself of the very 
great inequality which you are so sensible of but as it is 
the disappointment is single and i trust will not be lasting 
i have no thoughts of matrimony at present 
he was too angry to say another word her manner too decided 
to invite supplication and in this state of swelling resentment 
and mutually deep mortification they had to continue together a few 
minutes longer for the fears of mr woodhouse had confined them 
to a foot pace if there had not been so much anger there would have 
been desperate awkwardness but their straightforward emotions left 
no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment without knowing 
when the carriage turned into vicarage lane or when it stopped 
they found themselves all at once at the door of his house 
and he was out before another syllable passed emma then felt it 
indispensable to wish him a good night the compliment was just returned 
coldly and proudly and under indescribable irritation of spirits 
she was then conveyed to hartfield 
there she was welcomed with the utmost delight by her father 
who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from 
vicarage lane turning a corner which he could never bear to think of 
and in strange hands a mere common coachman no james and there it 
seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well 
for mr john knightley ashamed of his ill humour was now all 
kindness and attention and so particularly solicitous for the comfort 
of her father as to seem if not quite ready to join him in a basin 
of gruel perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome 
and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party 
except herself but her mind had never been in such perturbation 
and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till 
the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection 
chapter xvi 
the hair was curled and the maid sent away and emma sat down to think 
and be miserable it was a wretched business indeed such an overthrow 
of every thing she had been wishing for such a development of every 
thing most unwelcome such a blow for harriet that was the worst 
of all every part of it brought pain and humiliation of some sort 
or other but compared with the evil to harriet all was light 
and she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken 
more in error more disgraced by mis judgment than she actually was 
could the effects of her blunders have been confined to herself 
if i had not persuaded harriet into liking the man i could have 
borne any thing he might have doubled his presumption to me 
but poor harriet 
how she could have been so deceived he protested that he 
had never thought seriously of harriet never she looked back 
as well as she could but it was all confusion she had taken 
up the idea she supposed and made every thing bend to it 
his manners however must have been unmarked wavering dubious 
or she could not have been so misled 
the picture how eager he had been about the picture 
and the charade and an hundred other circumstances 
how clearly they had seemed to point at harriet to be sure 
the charade with its ready wit but then the soft eyes 
in fact it suited neither it was a jumble without taste or truth 
who could have seen through such thick headed nonsense 
certainly she had often especially of late thought his manners 
to herself unnecessarily gallant but it had passed as his way 
as a mere error of judgment of knowledge of taste as one proof 
among others that he had not always lived in the best society 
that with all the gentleness of his address true elegance 
was sometimes wanting but till this very day she had never 
for an instant suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect 
to her as harriet s friend 
to mr john knightley was she indebted for her first idea on 
the subject for the first start of its possibility there was 
no denying that those brothers had penetration she remembered 
what mr knightley had once said to her about mr elton the caution 
he had given the conviction he had professed that mr elton would 
never marry indiscreetly and blushed to think how much truer 
a knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she 
had reached herself it was dreadfully mortifying but mr elton 
was proving himself in many respects the very reverse of what she 
had meant and believed him proud assuming conceited very full 
of his own claims and little concerned about the feelings of others 
contrary to the usual course of things mr elton s wanting 
to pay his addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion 
his professions and his proposals did him no service she thought 
nothing of his attachment and was insulted by his hopes 
he wanted to marry well and having the arrogance to raise his 
eyes to her pretended to be in love but she was perfectly easy 
as to his not suffering any disappointment that need be cared for 
there had been no real affection either in his language or manners 
sighs and fine words had been given in abundance but she could 
hardly devise any set of expressions or fancy any tone of voice 
less allied with real love she need not trouble herself to pity him 
he only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself and if miss woodhouse 
of hartfield the heiress of thirty thousand pounds were not quite 
so easily obtained as he had fancied he would soon try for miss 
somebody else with twenty or with ten 
but that he should talk of encouragement should consider her as 
aware of his views accepting his attentions meaning in short 
to marry him should suppose himself her equal in connexion 
or mind look down upon her friend so well understanding the 
gradations of rank below him and be so blind to what rose above 
as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her 
it was most provoking 
perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he 
was her inferior in talent and all the elegancies of mind 
the very want of such equality might prevent his perception of it 
but he must know that in fortune and consequence she was greatly 
his superior he must know that the woodhouses had been settled 
for several generations at hartfield the younger branch 
of a very ancient family and that the eltons were nobody 
the landed property of hartfield certainly was inconsiderable 
being but a sort of notch in the donwell abbey estate to which all 
the rest of highbury belonged but their fortune from other sources 
was such as to make them scarcely secondary to donwell abbey itself 
in every other kind of consequence and the woodhouses had long 
held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which 
mr elton had first entered not two years ago to make his way 
as he could without any alliances but in trade or any thing 
to recommend him to notice but his situation and his civility 
but he had fancied her in love with him that evidently must 
have been his dependence and after raving a little about the 
seeming incongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head 
emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that her own 
behaviour to him had been so complaisant and obliging so full of 
courtesy and attention as supposing her real motive unperceived 
might warrant a man of ordinary observation and delicacy 
like mr elton in fancying himself a very decided favourite if she 
had so misinterpreted his feelings she had little right to wonder 
that he with self interest to blind him should have mistaken hers 
the first error and the worst lay at her door it was foolish 
it was wrong to take so active a part in bringing any two 
people together it was adventuring too far assuming too much 
making light of what ought to be serious a trick of what ought 
to be simple she was quite concerned and ashamed and resolved 
to do such things no more 
here have i said she actually talked poor harriet into being 
very much attached to this man she might never have thought of him 
but for me and certainly never would have thought of him with hope 
if i had not assured her of his attachment for she is as modest 
and humble as i used to think him oh that i had been satisfied with 
persuading her not to accept young martin there i was quite right 
that was well done of me but there i should have stopped and left 
the rest to time and chance i was introducing her into good company 
and giving her the opportunity of pleasing some one worth having 
i ought not to have attempted more but now poor girl her peace 
is cut up for some time i have been but half a friend to her 
and if she were not to feel this disappointment so very much i am 
sure i have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable 
for her william coxe oh no i could not endure william coxe 
a pert young lawyer 
she stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse and then resumed 
a more serious more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been 
and might be and must be the distressing explanation she had 
to make to harriet and all that poor harriet would be suffering 
with the awkwardness of future meetings the difficulties of 
continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance of subduing feelings 
concealing resentment and avoiding eclat were enough to occupy 
her in most unmirthful reflections some time longer and she went 
to bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her having 
blundered most dreadfully 
to youth and natural cheerfulness like emma s though under 
temporary gloom at night the return of day will hardly fail 
to bring return of spirits the youth and cheerfulness of morning 
are in happy analogy and of powerful operation and if the 
distress be not poignant enough to keep the eyes unclosed they 
will be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope 
emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had 
gone to bed more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her 
and to depend on getting tolerably out of it 
it was a great consolation that mr elton should not be really 
in love with her or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking 
to disappoint him that harriet s nature should not be of that 
superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive 
and that there could be no necessity for any body s knowing 
what had passed except the three principals and especially 
for her father s being given a moment s uneasiness about it 
these were very cheering thoughts and the sight of a great deal 
of snow on the ground did her further service for any thing was 
welcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder 
at present 
the weather was most favourable for her though christmas day 
she could not go to church mr woodhouse would have been miserable 
had his daughter attempted it and she was therefore safe from 
either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas 
the ground covered with snow and the atmosphere in that unsettled 
state between frost and thaw which is of all others the most 
unfriendly for exercise every morning beginning in rain or snow 
and every evening setting in to freeze she was for many days a most 
honourable prisoner no intercourse with harriet possible but by note 
no church for her on sunday any more than on christmas day and no 
need to find excuses for mr elton s absenting himself 
it was weather which might fairly confine every body at home 
and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort 
in some society or other it was very pleasant to have her father 
so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house 
too wise to stir out and to hear him say to mr knightley whom no 
weather could keep entirely from them 
ah mr knightley why do not you stay at home like poor mr elton 
these days of confinement would have been but for her private 
perplexities remarkably comfortable as such seclusion exactly 
suited her brother whose feelings must always be of great importance 
to his companions and he had besides so thoroughly cleared off 
his ill humour at randalls that his amiableness never failed him 
during the rest of his stay at hartfield he was always agreeable 
and obliging and speaking pleasantly of every body but with all 
the hopes of cheerfulness and all the present comfort of delay 
there was still such an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation 
with harriet as made it impossible for emma to be ever perfectly at ease 
chapter xvii 
mr and mrs john knightley were not detained long at hartfield 
the weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move 
and mr woodhouse having as usual tried to persuade his daughter 
to stay behind with all her children was obliged to see the whole 
party set off and return to his lamentations over the destiny 
of poor isabella which poor isabella passing her life with 
those she doated on full of their merits blind to their faults 
and always innocently busy might have been a model of right 
feminine happiness 
the evening of the very day on which they went brought a note 
from mr elton to mr woodhouse a long civil ceremonious note 
to say with mr elton s best compliments that he was proposing 
to leave highbury the following morning in his way to bath 
where in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends 
he had engaged to spend a few weeks and very much regretted 
the impossibility he was under from various circumstances of 
weather and business of taking a personal leave of mr woodhouse 
of whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful sense 
and had mr woodhouse any commands should be happy to attend to them 
emma was most agreeably surprized mr elton s absence just 
at this time was the very thing to be desired she admired 
him for contriving it though not able to give him much credit 
for the manner in which it was announced resentment could not 
have been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father 
from which she was so pointedly excluded she had not even a 
share in his opening compliments her name was not mentioned 
and there was so striking a change in all this and such an 
ill judged solemnity of leave taking in his graceful acknowledgments 
as she thought at first could not escape her father s suspicion 
it did however her father was quite taken up with the surprize 
of so sudden a journey and his fears that mr elton might never get 
safely to the end of it and saw nothing extraordinary in his language 
it was a very useful note for it supplied them with fresh matter 
for thought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening 
mr woodhouse talked over his alarms and emma was in spirits 
to persuade them away with all her usual promptitude 
she now resolved to keep harriet no longer in the dark she had 
reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold and it was 
desirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting 
the better of her other complaint before the gentleman s return 
she went to mrs goddard s accordingly the very next day to undergo 
the necessary penance of communication and a severe one it was 
she had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously 
feeding to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred 
and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis judging in all her 
ideas on one subject all her observations all her convictions 
all her prophecies for the last six weeks 
the confession completely renewed her first shame and the sight 
of harriet s tears made her think that she should never be in charity 
with herself again 
harriet bore the intelligence very well blaming nobody 
and in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition 
and lowly opinion of herself as must appear with particular 
advantage at that moment to her friend 
emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost 
and all that was amiable all that ought to be attaching 
seemed on harriet s side not her own harriet did not consider 
herself as having any thing to complain of the affection of such 
a man as mr elton would have been too great a distinction 
she never could have deserved him and nobody but so partial 
and kind a friend as miss woodhouse would have thought it possible 
her tears fell abundantly but her grief was so truly artless 
that no dignity could have made it more respectable in emma s eyes 
and she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart 
and understanding really for the time convinced that harriet was 
the superior creature of the two and that to resemble her would 
be more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or 
intelligence could do 
it was rather too late in the day to set about being simple minded 
and ignorant but she left her with every previous resolution 
confirmed of being humble and discreet and repressing imagination 
all the rest of her life her second duty now inferior only to her 
father s claims was to promote harriet s comfort and endeavour 
to prove her own affection in some better method than by match making 
she got her to hartfield and shewed her the most unvarying kindness 
striving to occupy and amuse her and by books and conversation 
to drive mr elton from her thoughts 
time she knew must be allowed for this being thoroughly done and she 
could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general 
and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to mr elton 
in particular but it seemed to her reasonable that at harriet s age 
and with the entire extinction of all hope such a progress might be 
made towards a state of composure by the time of mr elton s return 
as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance 
without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them 
harriet did think him all perfection and maintained the non existence 
of any body equal to him in person or goodness and did in truth 
prove herself more resolutely in love than emma had foreseen 
but yet it appeared to her so natural so inevitable to strive 
against an inclination of that sort unrequited that she could not 
comprehend its continuing very long in equal force 
if mr elton on his return made his own indifference as evident 
and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do 
she could not imagine harriet s persisting to place her happiness 
in the sight or the recollection of him 
their being fixed so absolutely fixed in the same place was bad 
for each for all three not one of them had the power of removal 
or of effecting any material change of society they must encounter 
each other and make the best of it 
harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at 
mrs goddard s mr elton being the adoration of all the teachers 
and great girls in the school and it must be at hartfield only 
that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling 
moderation or repellent truth where the wound had been given 
there must the cure be found if anywhere and emma felt that 
till she saw her in the way of cure there could be no true peace 
for herself 
chapter xviii 
mr frank churchill did not come when the time proposed 
drew near mrs weston s fears were justified in the arrival 
of a letter of excuse for the present he could not be spared 
to his very great mortification and regret but still he looked 
forward with the hope of coming to randalls at no distant period 
mrs weston was exceedingly disappointed much more disappointed 
in fact than her husband though her dependence on seeing the 
young man had been so much more sober but a sanguine temper 
though for ever expecting more good than occurs does not 
always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression 
it soon flies over the present failure and begins to hope again 
for half an hour mr weston was surprized and sorry but then he 
began to perceive that frank s coming two or three months later 
would be a much better plan better time of year better weather 
and that he would be able without any doubt to stay considerably 
longer with them than if he had come sooner 
these feelings rapidly restored his comfort while mrs weston 
of a more apprehensive disposition foresaw nothing but a repetition 
of excuses and delays and after all her concern for what her husband 
was to suffer suffered a great deal more herself 
emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really 
about mr frank churchill s not coming except as a disappointment 
at randalls the acquaintance at present had no charm for her 
she wanted rather to be quiet and out of temptation but still as it 
was desirable that she should appear in general like her usual self 
she took care to express as much interest in the circumstance 
and enter as warmly into mr and mrs weston s disappointment 
as might naturally belong to their friendship 
she was the first to announce it to mr knightley and exclaimed 
quite as much as was necessary or being acting a part perhaps 
rather more at the conduct of the churchills in keeping him away 
she then proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt of the 
advantage of such an addition to their confined society in surry 
the pleasure of looking at somebody new the gala day to highbury entire 
which the sight of him would have made and ending with reflections 
on the churchills again found herself directly involved in a 
disagreement with mr knightley and to her great amusement 
perceived that she was taking the other side of the question from her 
real opinion and making use of mrs weston s arguments against herself 
the churchills are very likely in fault said mr knightley 
coolly but i dare say he might come if he would 
i do not know why you should say so he wishes exceedingly to come 
but his uncle and aunt will not spare him 
i cannot believe that he has not the power of coming if he made 
a point of it it is too unlikely for me to believe it without proof 
how odd you are what has mr frank churchill done to make you 
suppose him such an unnatural creature 
i am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature in suspecting 
that he may have learnt to be above his connexions and to care 
very little for any thing but his own pleasure from living with 
those who have always set him the example of it it is a great deal 
more natural than one could wish that a young man brought up 
by those who are proud luxurious and selfish should be proud 
luxurious and selfish too if frank churchill had wanted to see 
his father he would have contrived it between september and january 
a man at his age what is he three or four and twenty cannot be 
without the means of doing as much as that it is impossible 
that is easily said and easily felt by you who have always 
been your own master you are the worst judge in the world 
mr knightley of the difficulties of dependence you do not know 
what it is to have tempers to manage 
it is not to be conceived that a man of three or four and twenty 
should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount he cannot 
want money he cannot want leisure we know on the contrary 
that he has so much of both that he is glad to get rid of them at 
the idlest haunts in the kingdom we hear of him for ever at some 
watering place or other a little while ago he was at weymouth 
this proves that he can leave the churchills 
yes sometimes he can 
and those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while 
whenever there is any temptation of pleasure 
it is very unfair to judge of any body s conduct without an 
intimate knowledge of their situation nobody who has not been 
in the interior of a family can say what the difficulties 
of any individual of that family may be we ought to be 
acquainted with enscombe and with mrs churchill s temper 
before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do 
he may at times be able to do a great deal more than he can at others 
there is one thing emma which a man can always do if he chuses 
and that is his duty not by manoeuvring and finessing but by vigour 
and resolution it is frank churchill s duty to pay this attention 
to his father he knows it to be so by his promises and messages 
but if he wished to do it it might be done a man who felt rightly 
would say at once simply and resolutely to mrs churchill 
every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make 
to your convenience but i must go and see my father immediately 
i know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him 
on the present occasion i shall therefore set off to morrow 
if he would say so to her at once in the tone of decision becoming 
a man there would be no opposition made to his going 
no said emma laughing but perhaps there might be some made to his 
coming back again such language for a young man entirely dependent 
to use nobody but you mr knightley would imagine it possible 
but you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly 
opposite to your own mr frank churchill to be making such 
a speech as that to the uncle and aunt who have brought him up 
and are to provide for him standing up in the middle of the room 
i suppose and speaking as loud as he could how can you imagine 
such conduct practicable 
depend upon it emma a sensible man would find no difficulty in it 
he would feel himself in the right and the declaration made 
of course as a man of sense would make it in a proper manner 
would do him more good raise him higher fix his interest stronger 
with the people he depended on than all that a line of shifts 
and expedients can ever do respect would be added to affection 
they would feel that they could trust him that the nephew who had 
done rightly by his father would do rightly by them for they know 
as well as he does as well as all the world must know that he 
ought to pay this visit to his father and while meanly exerting 
their power to delay it are in their hearts not thinking the better 
of him for submitting to their whims respect for right conduct 
is felt by every body if he would act in this sort of manner 
on principle consistently regularly their little minds would bend 
to his 
i rather doubt that you are very fond of bending little minds 
but where little minds belong to rich people in authority 
i think they have a knack of swelling out till they are quite as 
unmanageable as great ones i can imagine that if you as you are 
mr knightley were to be transported and placed all at once in 
mr frank churchill s situation you would be able to say and do 
just what you have been recommending for him and it might have 
a very good effect the churchills might not have a word to say 
in return but then you would have no habits of early obedience 
and long observance to break through to him who has it might 
not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence 
and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought 
he may have as strong a sense of what would be right as you can have 
without being so equal under particular circumstances to act up 
to it 
then it would not be so strong a sense if it failed to produce 
equal exertion it could not be an equal conviction 
oh the difference of situation and habit i wish you would try 
to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel 
in directly opposing those whom as child and boy he has been 
looking up to all his life 
our amiable young man is a very weak young man if this be the first 
occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against 
the will of others it ought to have been a habit with him by 
this time of following his duty instead of consulting expediency 
i can allow for the fears of the child but not of the man 
as he became rational he ought to have roused himself and shaken off 
all that was unworthy in their authority he ought to have opposed 
the first attempt on their side to make him slight his father 
had he begun as he ought there would have been no difficulty now 
we shall never agree about him cried emma but that is 
nothing extraordinary i have not the least idea of his being 
a weak young man i feel sure that he is not mr weston would 
not be blind to folly though in his own son but he is very likely 
to have a more yielding complying mild disposition than would suit 
your notions of man s perfection i dare say he has and though 
it may cut him off from some advantages it will secure him many others 
yes all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move 
and of leading a life of mere idle pleasure and fancying himself 
extremely expert in finding excuses for it he can sit down and 
write a fine flourishing letter full of professions and falsehoods 
and persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method 
in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his father s 
having any right to complain his letters disgust me 
your feelings are singular they seem to satisfy every body else 
i suspect they do not satisfy mrs weston they hardly can 
satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings standing in 
a mother s place but without a mother s affection to blind her 
it is on her account that attention to randalls is doubly due 
and she must doubly feel the omission had she been a person 
of consequence herself he would have come i dare say and it would 
not have signified whether he did or no can you think your friend 
behindhand in these sort of considerations do you suppose she 
does not often say all this to herself no emma your amiable 
young man can be amiable only in french not in english he may be 
very aimable have very good manners and be very agreeable but he 
can have no english delicacy towards the feelings of other people 
nothing really amiable about him 
you seem determined to think ill of him 
me not at all replied mr knightley rather displeased i do 
not want to think ill of him i should be as ready to acknowledge 
his merits as any other man but i hear of none except what are 
merely personal that he is well grown and good looking with smooth 
plausible manners 
well if he have nothing else to recommend him he will be a 
treasure at highbury we do not often look upon fine young men 
well bred and agreeable we must not be nice and ask for all 
the virtues into the bargain cannot you imagine mr knightley 
what a sensation his coming will produce there will be but one subject 
throughout the parishes of donwell and highbury but one interest 
one object of curiosity it will be all mr frank churchill 
we shall think and speak of nobody else 
you will excuse my being so much over powered if i find him 
conversable i shall be glad of his acquaintance but if he is only 
a chattering coxcomb he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts 
my idea of him is that he can adapt his conversation to the taste 
of every body and has the power as well as the wish of being 
universally agreeable to you he will talk of farming to me 
of drawing or music and so on to every body having that general 
information on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead 
or take the lead just as propriety may require and to speak 
extremely well on each that is my idea of him 
and mine said mr knightley warmly is that if he turn out any 
thing like it he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing 
what at three and twenty to be the king of his company the great man 
the practised politician who is to read every body s character 
and make every body s talents conduce to the display of his 
own superiority to be dispensing his flatteries around that he 
may make all appear like fools compared with himself my dear emma 
your own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came 
to the point 
i will say no more about him cried emma you turn every 
thing to evil we are both prejudiced you against i for him 
and we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here 
prejudiced i am not prejudiced 
but i am very much and without being at all ashamed of it 
my love for mr and mrs weston gives me a decided prejudice in 
his favour 
he is a person i never think of from one month s end to another 
said mr knightley with a degree of vexation which made emma 
immediately talk of something else though she could not comprehend 
why he should be angry 
to take a dislike to a young man only because he appeared to be 
of a different disposition from himself was unworthy the real 
liberality of mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him 
for with all the high opinion of himself which she had often laid 
to his charge she had never before for a moment supposed it could 
make him unjust to the merit of another 
volume ii 
chapter i 
emma and harriet had been walking together one morning and 
in emma s opinion had been talking enough of mr elton for that day 
she could not think that harriet s solace or her own sins required more 
and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject 
as they returned but it burst out again when she thought she 
had succeeded and after speaking some time of what the poor must 
suffer in winter and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive 
mr elton is so good to the poor she found something else must be done 
they were just approaching the house where lived mrs and miss bates 
she determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers 
there was always sufficient reason for such an attention mrs and 
miss bates loved to be called on and she knew she was considered 
by the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her 
as rather negligent in that respect and as not contributing what she 
ought to the stock of their scanty comforts 
she had had many a hint from mr knightley and some from her own heart 
as to her deficiency but none were equal to counteract the persuasion 
of its being very disagreeable a waste of time tiresome women 
and all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second rate 
and third rate of highbury who were calling on them for ever 
and therefore she seldom went near them but now she made the sudden 
resolution of not passing their door without going in observing 
as she proposed it to harriet that as well as she could calculate 
they were just now quite safe from any letter from jane fairfax 
the house belonged to people in business mrs and miss bates occupied 
the drawing room floor and there in the very moderate sized apartment 
which was every thing to them the visitors were most cordially 
and even gratefully welcomed the quiet neat old lady who with her 
knitting was seated in the warmest corner wanting even to give up 
her place to miss woodhouse and her more active talking daughter 
almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness thanks for 
their visit solicitude for their shoes anxious inquiries after 
mr woodhouse s health cheerful communications about her mother s 
and sweet cake from the beaufet mrs cole had just been there 
just called in for ten minutes and had been so good as to sit an 
hour with them and she had taken a piece of cake and been so kind 
as to say she liked it very much and therefore she hoped miss 
woodhouse and miss smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too 
the mention of the coles was sure to be followed by that of mr elton 
there was intimacy between them and mr cole had heard from 
mr elton since his going away emma knew what was coming they must 
have the letter over again and settle how long he had been gone 
and how much he was engaged in company and what a favourite he 
was wherever he went and how full the master of the ceremonies 
ball had been and she went through it very well with all the 
interest and all the commendation that could be requisite and always 
putting forward to prevent harriet s being obliged to say a word 
this she had been prepared for when she entered the house 
but meant having once talked him handsomely over to be no farther 
incommoded by any troublesome topic and to wander at large amongst 
all the mistresses and misses of highbury and their card parties 
she had not been prepared to have jane fairfax succeed mr elton 
but he was actually hurried off by miss bates she jumped away 
from him at last abruptly to the coles to usher in a letter from 
her niece 
oh yes mr elton i understand certainly as to dancing 
mrs cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at bath was 
mrs cole was so kind as to sit some time with us talking of jane 
for as soon as she came in she began inquiring after her 
jane is so very great a favourite there whenever she is with us 
mrs cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough 
and i must say that jane deserves it as much as any body can 
and so she began inquiring after her directly saying i know you 
cannot have heard from jane lately because it is not her time 
for writing and when i immediately said but indeed we have 
we had a letter this very morning i do not know that i ever saw 
any body more surprized have you upon your honour said she 
well that is quite unexpected do let me hear what she says 
emma s politeness was at hand directly to say with smiling interest 
have you heard from miss fairfax so lately i am extremely happy 
i hope she is well 
thank you you are so kind replied the happily deceived aunt 
while eagerly hunting for the letter oh here it is i was sure 
it could not be far off but i had put my huswife upon it you see 
without being aware and so it was quite hid but i had it in my hand 
so very lately that i was almost sure it must be on the table 
i was reading it to mrs cole and since she went away i was 
reading it again to my mother for it is such a pleasure to her 
a letter from jane that she can never hear it often enough 
so i knew it could not be far off and here it is only just under 
my huswife and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what 
she says but first of all i really must in justice to jane 
apologise for her writing so short a letter only two pages you see 
hardly two and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half 
my mother often wonders that i can make it out so well 
she often says when the letter is first opened well hetty 
now i think you will be put to it to make out all that checker work 
do not you madam and then i tell her i am sure she would contrive 
to make it out herself if she had nobody to do it for her 
every word of it i am sure she would pore over it till she had 
made out every word and indeed though my mother s eyes are not 
so good as they were she can see amazingly well still thank god 
with the help of spectacles it is such a blessing my mother s 
are really very good indeed jane often says when she is here 
i am sure grandmama you must have had very strong eyes to see 
as you do and so much fine work as you have done too i only wish 
my eyes may last me as well 
all this spoken extremely fast obliged miss bates to stop for breath 
and emma said something very civil about the excellence of miss 
fairfax s handwriting 
you are extremely kind replied miss bates highly gratified 
you who are such a judge and write so beautifully yourself 
i am sure there is nobody s praise that could give us so much pleasure 
as miss woodhouse s my mother does not hear she is a little deaf 
you know madam addressing her do you hear what miss woodhouse 
is so obliging to say about jane s handwriting 
and emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment 
repeated twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it 
she was pondering in the meanwhile upon the possibility without seeming 
very rude of making her escape from jane fairfax s letter and had 
almost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse 
when miss bates turned to her again and seized her attention 
my mother s deafness is very trifling you see just nothing at all 
by only raising my voice and saying any thing two or three times over 
she is sure to hear but then she is used to my voice but it is very 
remarkable that she should always hear jane better than she does me 
jane speaks so distinct however she will not find her grandmama 
at all deafer than she was two years ago which is saying a great 
deal at my mother s time of life and it really is full two years 
you know since she was here we never were so long without seeing 
her before and as i was telling mrs cole we shall hardly know 
how to make enough of her now 
are you expecting miss fairfax here soon 
oh yes next week 
indeed that must be a very great pleasure 
thank you you are very kind yes next week every body is 
so surprized and every body says the same obliging things i am 
sure she will be as happy to see her friends at highbury as they 
can be to see her yes friday or saturday she cannot say which 
because colonel campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one 
of those days so very good of them to send her the whole way 
but they always do you know oh yes friday or saturday next 
that is what she writes about that is the reason of her writing out 
of rule as we call it for in the common course we should not have 
heard from her before next tuesday or wednesday 
yes so i imagined i was afraid there could be little chance 
of my hearing any thing of miss fairfax to day 
so obliging of you no we should not have heard if it had not 
been for this particular circumstance of her being to come here 
so soon my mother is so delighted for she is to be three months 
with us at least three months she says so positively as i 
am going to have the pleasure of reading to you the case is 
you see that the campbells are going to ireland mrs dixon has 
persuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly 
they had not intended to go over till the summer but she is so 
impatient to see them again for till she married last october 
she was never away from them so much as a week which must make 
it very strange to be in different kingdoms i was going to say 
but however different countries and so she wrote a very urgent letter 
to her mother or her father i declare i do not know which it was 
but we shall see presently in jane s letter wrote in mr dixon s 
name as well as her own to press their coming over directly 
and they would give them the meeting in dublin and take them back 
to their country seat baly craig a beautiful place i fancy 
jane has heard a great deal of its beauty from mr dixon i mean 
i do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else 
but it was very natural you know that he should like to speak 
of his own place while he was paying his addresses and as jane used 
to be very often walking out with them for colonel and mrs campbell 
were very particular about their daughter s not walking out 
often with only mr dixon for which i do not at all blame them 
of course she heard every thing he might be telling miss campbell 
about his own home in ireland and i think she wrote us word 
that he had shewn them some drawings of the place views that he 
had taken himself he is a most amiable charming young man 
i believe jane was quite longing to go to ireland from his account 
of things 
at this moment an ingenious and animating suspicion entering 
emma s brain with regard to jane fairfax this charming mr dixon 
and the not going to ireland she said with the insidious design 
of farther discovery 
you must feel it very fortunate that miss fairfax should be allowed 
to come to you at such a time considering the very particular 
friendship between her and mrs dixon you could hardly have expected 
her to be excused from accompanying colonel and mrs campbell 
very true very true indeed the very thing that we have always 
been rather afraid of for we should not have liked to have her 
at such a distance from us for months together not able to come 
if any thing was to happen but you see every thing turns out 
for the best they want her mr and mrs dixon excessively to 
come over with colonel and mrs campbell quite depend upon it 
nothing can be more kind or pressing than their joint invitation 
jane says as you will hear presently mr dixon does not seem in the 
least backward in any attention he is a most charming young man 
ever since the service he rendered jane at weymouth when they were 
out in that party on the water and she by the sudden whirling 
round of something or other among the sails would have been dashed 
into the sea at once and actually was all but gone if he had not 
with the greatest presence of mind caught hold of her habit 
i can never think of it without trembling but ever since we 
had the history of that day i have been so fond of mr dixon 
but in spite of all her friends urgency and her own wish 
of seeing ireland miss fairfax prefers devoting the time to you 
and mrs bates 
yes entirely her own doing entirely her own choice and colonel 
and mrs campbell think she does quite right just what they 
should recommend and indeed they particularly wish her to try 
her native air as she has not been quite so well as usual lately 
i am concerned to hear of it i think they judge wisely 
but mrs dixon must be very much disappointed mrs dixon 
i understand has no remarkable degree of personal beauty is not 
by any means to be compared with miss fairfax 
oh no you are very obliging to say such things but certainly not 
there is no comparison between them miss campbell always was 
absolutely plain but extremely elegant and amiable 
yes that of course 
jane caught a bad cold poor thing so long ago as the th 
of november as i am going to read to you and has never been 
well since a long time is not it for a cold to hang upon her 
she never mentioned it before because she would not alarm us 
just like her so considerate but however she is so far from well 
that her kind friends the campbells think she had better come home 
and try an air that always agrees with her and they have no doubt 
that three or four months at highbury will entirely cure her 
and it is certainly a great deal better that she should come here 
than go to ireland if she is unwell nobody could nurse her as we 
should do 
it appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world 
and so she is to come to us next friday or saturday and the 
campbells leave town in their way to holyhead the monday following 
as you will find from jane s letter so sudden you may guess 
dear miss woodhouse what a flurry it has thrown me in 
if it was not for the drawback of her illness but i am afraid 
we must expect to see her grown thin and looking very poorly 
i must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me as to that 
i always make a point of reading jane s letters through to myself first 
before i read them aloud to my mother you know for fear of there 
being any thing in them to distress her jane desired me to do it 
so i always do and so i began to day with my usual caution 
but no sooner did i come to the mention of her being unwell than i 
burst out quite frightened with bless me poor jane is ill 
which my mother being on the watch heard distinctly and was sadly 
alarmed at however when i read on i found it was not near so bad 
as i had fancied at first and i make so light of it now to her 
that she does not think much about it but i cannot imagine 
how i could be so off my guard if jane does not get well soon 
we will call in mr perry the expense shall not be thought of 
and though he is so liberal and so fond of jane that i dare say 
he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance we could not 
suffer it to be so you know he has a wife and family to maintain 
and is not to be giving away his time well now i have just given you 
a hint of what jane writes about we will turn to her letter and i am 
sure she tells her own story a great deal better than i can tell it 
for her 
i am afraid we must be running away said emma glancing at harriet 
and beginning to rise my father will be expecting us 
i had no intention i thought i had no power of staying more than 
five minutes when i first entered the house i merely called 
because i would not pass the door without inquiring after mrs bates 
but i have been so pleasantly detained now however we must wish 
you and mrs bates good morning 
and not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded 
she regained the street happy in this that though much had been 
forced on her against her will though she had in fact heard 
the whole substance of jane fairfax s letter she had been able 
to escape the letter itself 
chapter ii 
jane fairfax was an orphan the only child of mrs bates s 
youngest daughter 
the marriage of lieut fairfax of the regiment of infantry 
and miss jane bates had had its day of fame and pleasure 
hope and interest but nothing now remained of it save the melancholy 
remembrance of him dying in action abroad of his widow sinking 
under consumption and grief soon afterwards and this girl 
by birth she belonged to highbury and when at three years old 
on losing her mother she became the property the charge 
the consolation the fondling of her grandmother and aunt there had 
seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there 
of her being taught only what very limited means could command 
and growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement 
to be engrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person 
good understanding and warm hearted well meaning relations 
but the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave 
a change to her destiny this was colonel campbell who had 
very highly regarded fairfax as an excellent officer and most 
deserving young man and farther had been indebted to him for 
such attentions during a severe camp fever as he believed had saved 
his life these were claims which he did not learn to overlook 
though some years passed away from the death of poor fairfax 
before his own return to england put any thing in his power 
when he did return he sought out the child and took notice of her 
he was a married man with only one living child a girl 
about jane s age and jane became their guest paying them long visits 
and growing a favourite with all and before she was nine years old 
his daughter s great fondness for her and his own wish of being 
a real friend united to produce an offer from colonel campbell 
of undertaking the whole charge of her education it was accepted 
and from that period jane had belonged to colonel campbell s family 
and had lived with them entirely only visiting her grandmother 
from time to time 
the plan was that she should be brought up for educating others 
the very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father 
making independence impossible to provide for her otherwise 
was out of colonel campbell s power for though his income by pay 
and appointments was handsome his fortune was moderate and must 
be all his daughter s but by giving her an education he hoped 
to be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter 
such was jane fairfax s history she had fallen into good hands 
known nothing but kindness from the campbells and been given 
an excellent education living constantly with right minded 
and well informed people her heart and understanding had received 
every advantage of discipline and culture and colonel campbell s 
residence being in london every lighter talent had been done 
full justice to by the attendance of first rate masters 
her disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that 
friendship could do and at eighteen or nineteen she was as far 
as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children 
fully competent to the office of instruction herself but she 
was too much beloved to be parted with neither father nor mother 
could promote and the daughter could not endure it the evil day 
was put off it was easy to decide that she was still too young 
and jane remained with them sharing as another daughter in all 
the rational pleasures of an elegant society and a judicious 
mixture of home and amusement with only the drawback of the future 
the sobering suggestions of her own good understanding to remind 
her that all this might soon be over 
the affection of the whole family the warm attachment of miss 
campbell in particular was the more honourable to each party 
from the circumstance of jane s decided superiority both in beauty 
and acquirements that nature had given it in feature could not 
be unseen by the young woman nor could her higher powers of mind 
be unfelt by the parents they continued together with unabated 
regard however till the marriage of miss campbell who by that chance 
that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs 
giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior 
engaged the affections of mr dixon a young man rich and agreeable 
almost as soon as they were acquainted and was eligibly 
and happily settled while jane fairfax had yet her bread to earn 
this event had very lately taken place too lately for any thing to be 
yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path 
of duty though she had now reached the age which her own judgment 
had fixed on for beginning she had long resolved that one and twenty 
should be the period with the fortitude of a devoted novitiate 
she had resolved at one and twenty to complete the sacrifice 
and retire from all the pleasures of life of rational intercourse 
equal society peace and hope to penance and mortification for ever 
the good sense of colonel and mrs campbell could not oppose such 
a resolution though their feelings did as long as they lived 
no exertions would be necessary their home might be hers for ever 
and for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly 
but this would be selfishness what must be at last had better 
be soon perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder 
and wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay and spared 
her from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must 
now be relinquished still however affection was glad to catch 
at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment 
she had never been quite well since the time of their daughter s marriage 
and till she should have completely recovered her usual strength 
they must forbid her engaging in duties which so far from being 
compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits seemed 
under the most favourable circumstances to require something 
more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with 
tolerable comfort 
with regard to her not accompanying them to ireland her account 
to her aunt contained nothing but truth though there might be some 
truths not told it was her own choice to give the time of their 
absence to highbury to spend perhaps her last months of perfect 
liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear 
and the campbells whatever might be their motive or motives 
whether single or double or treble gave the arrangement 
their ready sanction and said that they depended more on a few 
months spent in her native air for the recovery of her health 
than on any thing else certain it was that she was to come 
and that highbury instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which 
had been so long promised it mr frank churchill must put up for 
the present with jane fairfax who could bring only the freshness 
of a two years absence 
emma was sorry to have to pay civilities to a person she did 
not like through three long months to be always doing more than 
she wished and less than she ought why she did not like jane 
fairfax might be a difficult question to answer mr knightley 
had once told her it was because she saw in her the really 
accomplished young woman which she wanted to be thought herself 
and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time 
there were moments of self examination in which her conscience could 
not quite acquit her but she could never get acquainted with her 
she did not know how it was but there was such coldness and reserve 
such apparent indifference whether she pleased or not and then 
her aunt was such an eternal talker and she was made such a fuss 
with by every body and it had been always imagined that they were 
to be so intimate because their ages were the same every body had 
supposed they must be so fond of each other these were her reasons 
she had no better 
it was a dislike so little just every imputed fault was so magnified 
by fancy that she never saw jane fairfax the first time after any 
considerable absence without feeling that she had injured her 
and now when the due visit was paid on her arrival after a two years 
interval she was particularly struck with the very appearance 
and manners which for those two whole years she had been depreciating 
jane fairfax was very elegant remarkably elegant and she had 
herself the highest value for elegance her height was pretty 
just such as almost every body would think tall and nobody could 
think very tall her figure particularly graceful her size a most 
becoming medium between fat and thin though a slight appearance 
of ill health seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two 
emma could not but feel all this and then her face her features 
there was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered 
it was not regular but it was very pleasing beauty her eyes 
a deep grey with dark eye lashes and eyebrows had never been denied 
their praise but the skin which she had been used to cavil at 
as wanting colour had a clearness and delicacy which really needed 
no fuller bloom it was a style of beauty of which elegance 
was the reigning character and as such she must in honour 
by all her principles admire it elegance which whether of person 
or of mind she saw so little in highbury there not to be vulgar 
was distinction and merit 
in short she sat during the first visit looking at jane fairfax 
with twofold complacency the sense of pleasure and the sense 
of rendering justice and was determining that she would dislike 
her no longer when she took in her history indeed her situation 
as well as her beauty when she considered what all this elegance 
was destined to what she was going to sink from how she was going 
to live it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion 
and respect especially if to every well known particular entitling 
her to interest were added the highly probable circumstance 
of an attachment to mr dixon which she had so naturally started 
to herself in that case nothing could be more pitiable 
or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on 
emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced 
mr dixon s actions from his wife or of any thing mischievous 
which her imagination had suggested at first if it were love 
it might be simple single successless love on her side alone 
she might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison 
while a sharer of his conversation with her friend and from the best 
the purest of motives might now be denying herself this visit 
to ireland and resolving to divide herself effectually from 
him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty 
upon the whole emma left her with such softened charitable feelings 
as made her look around in walking home and lament that highbury 
afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence 
nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her 
these were charming feelings but not lasting before she had 
committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for 
jane fairfax or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices 
and errors than saying to mr knightley she certainly is handsome 
she is better than handsome jane had spent an evening at hartfield 
with her grandmother and aunt and every thing was relapsing much 
into its usual state former provocations reappeared the aunt 
was as tiresome as ever more tiresome because anxiety for her 
health was now added to admiration of her powers and they had to 
listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter 
she ate for breakfast and how small a slice of mutton for dinner 
as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her 
mother and herself and jane s offences rose again they had music 
emma was obliged to play and the thanks and praise which necessarily 
followed appeared to her an affectation of candour an air 
of greatness meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very 
superior performance she was besides which was the worst of all 
so cold so cautious there was no getting at her real opinion 
wrapt up in a cloak of politeness she seemed determined 
to hazard nothing she was disgustingly was suspiciously reserved 
if any thing could be more where all was most she was more 
reserved on the subject of weymouth and the dixons than any thing 
she seemed bent on giving no real insight into mr dixon s character 
or her own value for his company or opinion of the suitableness 
of the match it was all general approbation and smoothness 
nothing delineated or distinguished it did her no service however 
her caution was thrown away emma saw its artifice and returned 
to her first surmises there probably was something more to conceal 
than her own preference mr dixon perhaps had been very near 
changing one friend for the other or been fixed only to miss campbell 
for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds 
the like reserve prevailed on other topics she and mr frank churchill 
had been at weymouth at the same time it was known that they were 
a little acquainted but not a syllable of real information could emma 
procure as to what he truly was was he handsome she believed 
he was reckoned a very fine young man was he agreeable 
he was generally thought so did he appear a sensible young man 
a young man of information at a watering place or in a common 
london acquaintance it was difficult to decide on such points 
manners were all that could be safely judged of under a much longer 
knowledge than they had yet had of mr churchill she believed 
every body found his manners pleasing emma could not forgive her 
chapter iii 
emma could not forgive her but as neither provocation nor resentment 
were discerned by mr knightley who had been of the party and had 
seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side 
he was expressing the next morning being at hartfield again on 
business with mr woodhouse his approbation of the whole not so 
openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room 
but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to emma 
he had been used to think her unjust to jane and had now great 
pleasure in marking an improvement 
a very pleasant evening he began as soon as mr woodhouse 
had been talked into what was necessary told that he understood 
and the papers swept away particularly pleasant you and miss 
fairfax gave us some very good music i do not know a more 
luxurious state sir than sitting at one s ease to be entertained 
a whole evening by two such young women sometimes with music 
and sometimes with conversation i am sure miss fairfax must 
have found the evening pleasant emma you left nothing undone 
i was glad you made her play so much for having no instrument 
at her grandmother s it must have been a real indulgence 
i am happy you approved said emma smiling but i hope i am 
not often deficient in what is due to guests at hartfield 
no my dear said her father instantly that i am sure you 
are not there is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are 
if any thing you are too attentive the muffin last night if it 
had been handed round once i think it would have been enough 
no said mr knightley nearly at the same time you are not 
often deficient not often deficient either in manner or comprehension 
i think you understand me therefore 
an arch look expressed i understand you well enough but she 
said only miss fairfax is reserved 
i always told you she was a little but you will soon overcome 
all that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome all that 
has its foundation in diffidence what arises from discretion 
must be honoured 
you think her diffident i do not see it 
my dear emma said he moving from his chair into one close 
by her you are not going to tell me i hope that you 
had not a pleasant evening 
oh no i was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions 
and amused to think how little information i obtained 
i am disappointed was his only answer 
i hope every body had a pleasant evening said mr woodhouse 
in his quiet way i had once i felt the fire rather too much 
but then i moved back my chair a little a very little and it did 
not disturb me miss bates was very chatty and good humoured 
as she always is though she speaks rather too quick however 
she is very agreeable and mrs bates too in a different way 
i like old friends and miss jane fairfax is a very pretty sort of 
young lady a very pretty and a very well behaved young lady indeed 
she must have found the evening agreeable mr knightley because she 
had emma 
true sir and emma because she had miss fairfax 
emma saw his anxiety and wishing to appease it at least for 
the present said and with a sincerity which no one could question 
she is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one s eyes from 
i am always watching her to admire and i do pity her from my heart 
mr knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared 
to express and before he could make any reply mr woodhouse 
whose thoughts were on the bates s said 
it is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined 
a great pity indeed and i have often wished but it is so little one 
can venture to do small trifling presents of any thing uncommon 
now we have killed a porker and emma thinks of sending them 
a loin or a leg it is very small and delicate hartfield pork is 
not like any other pork but still it is pork and my dear emma 
unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks nicely fried 
as ours are fried without the smallest grease and not roast it 
for no stomach can bear roast pork i think we had better send the leg 
do not you think so my dear 
my dear papa i sent the whole hind quarter i knew you would wish it 
there will be the leg to be salted you know which is so very nice 
and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like 
that is right my dear very right i had not thought of it before 
but that is the best way they must not over salt the leg and then 
if it is not over salted and if it is very thoroughly boiled 
just as serle boils ours and eaten very moderately of with a 
boiled turnip and a little carrot or parsnip i do not consider 
it unwholesome 
emma said mr knightley presently i have a piece of news for you 
you like news and i heard an article in my way hither that i think 
will interest you 
news oh yes i always like news what is it why do you 
smile so where did you hear it at randalls 
he had time only to say 
no not at randalls i have not been near randalls when the door 
was thrown open and miss bates and miss fairfax walked into the room 
full of thanks and full of news miss bates knew not which to 
give quickest mr knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment 
and that not another syllable of communication could rest with him 
oh my dear sir how are you this morning my dear miss woodhouse 
i come quite over powered such a beautiful hind quarter of pork 
you are too bountiful have you heard the news mr elton is going 
to be married 
emma had not had time even to think of mr elton and she was 
so completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start 
and a little blush at the sound 
there is my news i thought it would interest you 
said mr knightley with a smile which implied a conviction 
of some part of what had passed between them 
but where could you hear it cried miss bates where could 
you possibly hear it mr knightley for it is not five minutes 
since i received mrs cole s note no it cannot be more than five 
or at least ten for i had got my bonnet and spencer on just ready 
to come out i was only gone down to speak to patty again about 
the pork jane was standing in the passage were not you jane 
for my mother was so afraid that we had not any salting pan 
large enough so i said i would go down and see and jane said 
shall i go down instead for i think you have a little cold 
and patty has been washing the kitchen oh my dear 
said i well and just then came the note a miss hawkins 
that is all i know a miss hawkins of bath but mr knightley 
how could you possibly have heard it for the very moment mr cole 
told mrs cole of it she sat down and wrote to me a miss hawkins 
i was with mr cole on business an hour and a half ago 
he had just read elton s letter as i was shewn in and handed it 
to me directly 
well that is quite i suppose there never was a piece of news more 
generally interesting my dear sir you really are too bountiful 
my mother desires her very best compliments and regards and a 
thousand thanks and says you really quite oppress her 
we consider our hartfield pork replied mr woodhouse indeed it 
certainly is so very superior to all other pork that emma and i 
cannot have a greater pleasure than 
oh my dear sir as my mother says our friends are only too good 
to us if ever there were people who without having great wealth 
themselves had every thing they could wish for i am sure it is us 
we may well say that our lot is cast in a goodly heritage 
well mr knightley and so you actually saw the letter well 
it was short merely to announce but cheerful exulting of course 
here was a sly glance at emma he had been so fortunate as to 
i forget the precise words one has no business to remember them 
the information was as you state that he was going to be married 
to a miss hawkins by his style i should imagine it just settled 
mr elton going to be married said emma as soon as she could speak 
he will have every body s wishes for his happiness 
he is very young to settle was mr woodhouse s observation 
he had better not be in a hurry he seemed to me very well off 
as he was we were always glad to see him at hartfield 
a new neighbour for us all miss woodhouse said miss bates 
joyfully my mother is so pleased she says she cannot 
bear to have the poor old vicarage without a mistress 
this is great news indeed jane you have never seen 
mr elton no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him 
jane s curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly 
to occupy her 
no i have never seen mr elton she replied starting on this appeal 
is he is he a tall man 
who shall answer that question cried emma my father would 
say yes mr knightley no and miss bates and i that he is 
just the happy medium when you have been here a little longer 
miss fairfax you will understand that mr elton is the standard 
of perfection in highbury both in person and mind 
very true miss woodhouse so she will he is the very best 
young man but my dear jane if you remember i told you yesterday 
he was precisely the height of mr perry miss hawkins i dare say 
an excellent young woman his extreme attention to my mother 
wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew that she might hear the better 
for my mother is a little deaf you know it is not much but she 
does not hear quite quick jane says that colonel campbell is a 
little deaf he fancied bathing might be good for it the warm bath 
but she says it did him no lasting benefit colonel campbell 
you know is quite our angel and mr dixon seems a very charming 
young man quite worthy of him it is such a happiness when good 
people get together and they always do now here will be mr elton 
and miss hawkins and there are the coles such very good people 
and the perrys i suppose there never was a happier or a better couple 
than mr and mrs perry i say sir turning to mr woodhouse 
i think there are few places with such society as highbury 
i always say we are quite blessed in our neighbours my dear sir 
if there is one thing my mother loves better than another it is pork 
a roast loin of pork 
as to who or what miss hawkins is or how long he has been 
acquainted with her said emma nothing i suppose can be known 
one feels that it cannot be a very long acquaintance he has been 
gone only four weeks 
nobody had any information to give and after a few more wonderings 
emma said 
you are silent miss fairfax but i hope you mean to take 
an interest in this news you who have been hearing and seeing 
so much of late on these subjects who must have been so deep 
in the business on miss campbell s account we shall not excuse 
your being indifferent about mr elton and miss hawkins 
when i have seen mr elton replied jane i dare say i 
shall be interested but i believe it requires that with me 
and as it is some months since miss campbell married the impression 
may be a little worn off 
yes he has been gone just four weeks as you observe miss woodhouse 
said miss bates four weeks yesterday a miss hawkins well i had 
always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts 
not that i ever mrs cole once whispered to me but i immediately said 
no mr elton is a most worthy young man but in short i do 
not think i am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries 
i do not pretend to it what is before me i see at the same time 
nobody could wonder if mr elton should have aspired miss woodhouse 
let us me chatter on so good humouredly she knows i would not 
offend for the world how does miss smith do she seems quite 
recovered now have you heard from mrs john knightley lately 
oh those dear little children jane do you know i always fancy 
mr dixon like mr john knightley i mean in person tall and with 
that sort of look and not very talkative 
quite wrong my dear aunt there is no likeness at all 
very odd but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand 
one takes up a notion and runs away with it mr dixon you say 
is not strictly speaking handsome 
handsome oh no far from it certainly plain i told you he 
was plain 
my dear you said that miss campbell would not allow him to be plain 
and that you yourself 
oh as for me my judgment is worth nothing where i have a regard 
i always think a person well looking but i gave what i believed 
the general opinion when i called him plain 
well my dear jane i believe we must be running away 
the weather does not look well and grandmama will be uneasy 
you are too obliging my dear miss woodhouse but we really must 
take leave this has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed 
i shall just go round by mrs cole s but i shall not stop three minutes 
and jane you had better go home directly i would not have you 
out in a shower we think she is the better for highbury already 
thank you we do indeed i shall not attempt calling on mrs goddard 
for i really do not think she cares for any thing but boiled pork 
when we dress the leg it will be another thing good morning to you 
my dear sir oh mr knightley is coming too well that is 
so very i am sure if jane is tired you will be so kind as to 
give her your arm mr elton and miss hawkins good morning 
to you 
emma alone with her father had half her attention wanted by him 
while he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry 
and to marry strangers too and the other half she could give 
to her own view of the subject it was to herself an amusing 
and a very welcome piece of news as proving that mr elton 
could not have suffered long but she was sorry for harriet 
harriet must feel it and all that she could hope was by giving 
the first information herself to save her from hearing it abruptly 
from others it was now about the time that she was likely to call 
if she were to meet miss bates in her way and upon its beginning 
to rain emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be 
detaining her at mrs goddard s and that the intelligence would 
undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation 
the shower was heavy but short and it had not been over five minutes 
when in came harriet with just the heated agitated look which 
hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give and the 
oh miss woodhouse what do you think has happened which instantly 
burst forth had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation 
as the blow was given emma felt that she could not now shew greater 
kindness than in listening and harriet unchecked ran eagerly 
through what she had to tell she had set out from mrs goddard s 
half an hour ago she had been afraid it would rain she had been 
afraid it would pour down every moment but she thought she might 
get to hartfield first she had hurried on as fast as possible 
but then as she was passing by the house where a young woman 
was making up a gown for her she thought she would just step 
in and see how it went on and though she did not seem to stay 
half a moment there soon after she came out it began to rain 
and she did not know what to do so she ran on directly as fast 
as she could and took shelter at ford s ford s was the principal 
woollen draper linen draper and haberdasher s shop united 
the shop first in size and fashion in the place and so 
there she had set without an idea of any thing in the world 
full ten minutes perhaps when all of a sudden who should come in 
to be sure it was so very odd but they always dealt at ford s 
who should come in but elizabeth martin and her brother 
dear miss woodhouse only think i thought i should have fainted 
i did not know what to do i was sitting near the door elizabeth saw 
me directly but he did not he was busy with the umbrella 
i am sure she saw me but she looked away directly and took 
no notice and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop 
and i kept sitting near the door oh dear i was so miserable 
i am sure i must have been as white as my gown i could not go away 
you know because of the rain but i did so wish myself anywhere 
in the world but there oh dear miss woodhouse well at last 
i fancy he looked round and saw me for instead of going 
on with her buyings they began whispering to one another 
i am sure they were talking of me and i could not help thinking 
that he was persuading her to speak to me do you think he was 
miss woodhouse for presently she came forward came quite up 
to me and asked me how i did and seemed ready to shake hands 
if i would she did not do any of it in the same way that she used 
i could see she was altered but however she seemed to try to be 
very friendly and we shook hands and stood talking some time 
but i know no more what i said i was in such a tremble i remember 
she said she was sorry we never met now which i thought almost 
too kind dear miss woodhouse i was absolutely miserable 
by that time it was beginning to hold up and i was determined 
that nothing should stop me from getting away and then only think 
i found he was coming up towards me too slowly you know and as 
if he did not quite know what to do and so he came and spoke 
and i answered and i stood for a minute feeling dreadfully 
you know one cannot tell how and then i took courage and said it 
did not rain and i must go and so off i set and i had not got 
three yards from the door when he came after me only to say 
if i was going to hartfield he thought i had much better go round 
by mr cole s stables for i should find the near way quite floated 
by this rain oh dear i thought it would have been the death of me 
so i said i was very much obliged to him you know i could 
not do less and then he went back to elizabeth and i came round 
by the stables i believe i did but i hardly knew where i was 
or any thing about it oh miss woodhouse i would rather done 
any thing than have it happen and yet you know there was a sort 
of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly 
and elizabeth too oh miss woodhouse do talk to me and make 
me comfortable again 
very sincerely did emma wish to do so but it was not immediately in 
her power she was obliged to stop and think she was not thoroughly 
comfortable herself the young man s conduct and his sister s 
seemed the result of real feeling and she could not but pity them 
as harriet described it there had been an interesting mixture 
of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour 
but she had believed them to be well meaning worthy people before 
and what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion 
it was folly to be disturbed by it of course he must be sorry 
to lose her they must be all sorry ambition as well as love 
had probably been mortified they might all have hoped to rise 
by harriet s acquaintance and besides what was the value of 
harriet s description so easily pleased so little discerning 
what signified her praise 
she exerted herself and did try to make her comfortable 
by considering all that had passed as a mere trifle and quite 
unworthy of being dwelt on 
it might be distressing for the moment said she but you seem 
to have behaved extremely well and it is over and may never 
can never as a first meeting occur again and therefore you need 
not think about it 
harriet said very true and she would not think about it 
but still she talked of it still she could talk of nothing else 
and emma at last in order to put the martins out of her head 
was obliged to hurry on the news which she had meant to give 
with so much tender caution hardly knowing herself whether 
to rejoice or be angry ashamed or only amused at such a state 
of mind in poor harriet such a conclusion of mr elton s importance 
with her 
mr elton s rights however gradually revived though she did not 
feel the first intelligence as she might have done the day before 
or an hour before its interest soon increased and before their 
first conversation was over she had talked herself into all the 
sensations of curiosity wonder and regret pain and pleasure 
as to this fortunate miss hawkins which could conduce to place 
the martins under proper subordination in her fancy 
emma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting 
it had been serviceable in deadening the first shock without retaining 
any influence to alarm as harriet now lived the martins could 
not get at her without seeking her where hitherto they had wanted 
either the courage or the condescension to seek her for since her 
refusal of the brother the sisters never had been at mrs goddard s 
and a twelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again 
with any necessity or even any power of speech 
chapter iv 
human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in 
interesting situations that a young person who either marries 
or dies is sure of being kindly spoken of 
a week had not passed since miss hawkins s name was first 
mentioned in highbury before she was by some means or other 
discovered to have every recommendation of person and mind 
to be handsome elegant highly accomplished and perfectly amiable 
and when mr elton himself arrived to triumph in his happy prospects 
and circulate the fame of her merits there was very little more 
for him to do than to tell her christian name and say whose 
music she principally played 
mr elton returned a very happy man he had gone away rejected 
and mortified disappointed in a very sanguine hope after a series 
of what appeared to him strong encouragement and not only losing 
the right lady but finding himself debased to the level of a very 
wrong one he had gone away deeply offended he came back engaged 
to another and to another as superior of course to the first 
as under such circumstances what is gained always is to what is lost 
he came back gay and self satisfied eager and busy caring nothing 
for miss woodhouse and defying miss smith 
the charming augusta hawkins in addition to all the usual advantages 
of perfect beauty and merit was in possession of an independent fortune 
of so many thousands as would always be called ten a point of 
some dignity as well as some convenience the story told well 
he had not thrown himself away he had gained a woman of l 
or thereabouts and he had gained her with such delightful rapidity 
the first hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by 
distinguishing notice the history which he had to give mrs cole 
of the rise and progress of the affair was so glorious the steps 
so quick from the accidental rencontre to the dinner at mr green s 
and the party at mrs brown s smiles and blushes rising in importance 
with consciousness and agitation richly scattered the lady 
had been so easily impressed so sweetly disposed had in short 
to use a most intelligible phrase been so very ready to have him 
that vanity and prudence were equally contented 
he had caught both substance and shadow both fortune and affection 
and was just the happy man he ought to be talking only of himself 
and his own concerns expecting to be congratulated ready to be 
laughed at and with cordial fearless smiles now addressing 
all the young ladies of the place to whom a few weeks ago 
he would have been more cautiously gallant 
the wedding was no distant event as the parties had only themselves 
to please and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for 
and when he set out for bath again there was a general expectation 
which a certain glance of mrs cole s did not seem to contradict 
that when he next entered highbury he would bring his bride 
during his present short stay emma had barely seen him but just 
enough to feel that the first meeting was over and to give her 
the impression of his not being improved by the mixture of pique 
and pretension now spread over his air she was in fact 
beginning very much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing 
at all and his sight was so inseparably connected with some very 
disagreeable feelings that except in a moral light as a penance 
a lesson a source of profitable humiliation to her own mind 
she would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him again 
she wished him very well but he gave her pain and his welfare 
twenty miles off would administer most satisfaction 
the pain of his continued residence in highbury however must certainly 
be lessened by his marriage many vain solicitudes would be prevented 
many awkwardnesses smoothed by it a mrs elton would be an excuse for 
any change of intercourse former intimacy might sink without remark 
it would be almost beginning their life of civility again 
of the lady individually emma thought very little she was good 
enough for mr elton no doubt accomplished enough for highbury 
handsome enough to look plain probably by harriet s side 
as to connexion there emma was perfectly easy persuaded 
that after all his own vaunted claims and disdain of harriet 
he had done nothing on that article truth seemed attainable 
what she was must be uncertain but who she was might be found out 
and setting aside the l it did not appear that she was at 
all harriet s superior she brought no name no blood no alliance 
miss hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters of a bristol 
merchant of course he must be called but as the whole of the 
profits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate it was 
not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very 
moderate also part of every winter she had been used to spend in bath 
but bristol was her home the very heart of bristol for though 
the father and mother had died some years ago an uncle remained 
in the law line nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded 
of him than that he was in the law line and with him the daughter 
had lived emma guessed him to be the drudge of some attorney 
and too stupid to rise and all the grandeur of the connexion 
seemed dependent on the elder sister who was very well married 
to a gentleman in a great way near bristol who kept two carriages 
that was the wind up of the history that was the glory of 
miss hawkins 
could she but have given harriet her feelings about it all 
she had talked her into love but alas she was not so easily to be 
talked out of it the charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies 
of harriet s mind was not to be talked away he might be superseded 
by another he certainly would indeed nothing could be clearer 
even a robert martin would have been sufficient but nothing else 
she feared would cure her harriet was one of those who 
having once begun would be always in love and now poor girl 
she was considerably worse from this reappearance of mr elton 
she was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other emma saw 
him only once but two or three times every day harriet was sure 
just to meet with him or just to miss him just to hear his voice 
or see his shoulder just to have something occur to preserve him 
in her fancy in all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture 
she was moreover perpetually hearing about him for excepting when 
at hartfield she was always among those who saw no fault in mr elton 
and found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his concerns 
and every report therefore every guess all that had already 
occurred all that might occur in the arrangement of his affairs 
comprehending income servants and furniture was continually 
in agitation around her her regard was receiving strength by 
invariable praise of him and her regrets kept alive and feelings 
irritated by ceaseless repetitions of miss hawkins s happiness 
and continual observation of how much he seemed attached 
his air as he walked by the house the very sitting of his hat 
being all in proof of how much he was in love 
had it been allowable entertainment had there been no pain 
to her friend or reproach to herself in the waverings of 
harriet s mind emma would have been amused by its variations 
sometimes mr elton predominated sometimes the martins and each 
was occasionally useful as a check to the other mr elton s 
engagement had been the cure of the agitation of meeting mr martin 
the unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been 
a little put aside by elizabeth martin s calling at mrs goddard s 
a few days afterwards harriet had not been at home but a note had 
been prepared and left for her written in the very style to touch 
a small mixture of reproach with a great deal of kindness 
and till mr elton himself appeared she had been much occupied 
by it continually pondering over what could be done in return 
and wishing to do more than she dared to confess but mr elton 
in person had driven away all such cares while he staid 
the martins were forgotten and on the very morning of his setting off 
for bath again emma to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned 
judged it best for her to return elizabeth martin s visit 
how that visit was to be acknowledged what would be necessary 
and what might be safest had been a point of some doubtful 
consideration absolute neglect of the mother and sisters 
when invited to come would be ingratitude it must not be 
and yet the danger of a renewal of the acquaintance 
after much thinking she could determine on nothing better than harriet s 
returning the visit but in a way that if they had understanding 
should convince them that it was to be only a formal acquaintance 
she meant to take her in the carriage leave her at the abbey mill 
while she drove a little farther and call for her again so soon 
as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous 
recurrences to the past and give the most decided proof of what 
degree of intimacy was chosen for the future 
she could think of nothing better and though there was something 
in it which her own heart could not approve something of ingratitude 
merely glossed over it must be done or what would become of harriet 
chapter v 
small heart had harriet for visiting only half an hour before her 
friend called for her at mrs goddard s her evil stars had led 
her to the very spot where at that moment a trunk directed to 
the rev philip elton white hart bath was to be seen under the 
operation of being lifted into the butcher s cart which was to 
convey it to where the coaches past and every thing in this world 
excepting that trunk and the direction was consequently a blank 
she went however and when they reached the farm and she was to 
be put down at the end of the broad neat gravel walk which led 
between espalier apple trees to the front door the sight of every 
thing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn before 
was beginning to revive a little local agitation and when they parted 
emma observed her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity 
which determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed 
quarter of an hour she went on herself to give that portion 
of time to an old servant who was married and settled in donwell 
the quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again 
and miss smith receiving her summons was with her without delay 
and unattended by any alarming young man she came solitarily 
down the gravel walk a miss martin just appearing at the door 
and parting with her seemingly with ceremonious civility 
harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account 
she was feeling too much but at last emma collected from her 
enough to understand the sort of meeting and the sort of pain it 
was creating she had seen only mrs martin and the two girls 
they had received her doubtingly if not coolly and nothing 
beyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time 
till just at last when mrs martin s saying all of a sudden 
that she thought miss smith was grown had brought on a more 
interesting subject and a warmer manner in that very room 
she had been measured last september with her two friends 
there were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by 
the window he had done it they all seemed to remember the day 
the hour the party the occasion to feel the same consciousness 
the same regrets to be ready to return to the same good understanding 
and they were just growing again like themselves harriet as emma 
must suspect as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy 
when the carriage reappeared and all was over the style of 
the visit and the shortness of it were then felt to be decisive 
fourteen minutes to be given to those with whom she had thankfully 
passed six weeks not six months ago emma could not but picture 
it all and feel how justly they might resent how naturally 
harriet must suffer it was a bad business she would have given 
a great deal or endured a great deal to have had the martins 
in a higher rank of life they were so deserving that a little 
higher should have been enough but as it was how could she have 
done otherwise impossible she could not repent they must 
be separated but there was a great deal of pain in the process 
so much to herself at this time that she soon felt the necessity 
of a little consolation and resolved on going home by way of randalls 
to procure it her mind was quite sick of mr elton and the martins 
the refreshment of randalls was absolutely necessary 
it was a good scheme but on driving to the door they heard 
that neither master nor mistress was at home they had both 
been out some time the man believed they were gone to hartfield 
this is too bad cried emma as they turned away and now we 
shall just miss them too provoking i do not know when i have been 
so disappointed and she leaned back in the corner to indulge 
her murmurs or to reason them away probably a little of both 
such being the commonest process of a not ill disposed mind 
presently the carriage stopt she looked up it was stopt 
by mr and mrs weston who were standing to speak to her 
there was instant pleasure in the sight of them and still greater 
pleasure was conveyed in sound for mr weston immediately accosted 
her with 
how d ye do how d ye do we have been sitting with your father 
glad to see him so well frank comes to morrow i had a letter 
this morning we see him to morrow by dinner time to a certainty 
he is at oxford to day and he comes for a whole fortnight i knew it would 
be so if he had come at christmas he could not have staid three days 
i was always glad he did not come at christmas now we are going 
to have just the right weather for him fine dry settled weather 
we shall enjoy him completely every thing has turned out exactly 
as we could wish 
there was no resisting such news no possibility of avoiding the 
influence of such a happy face as mr weston s confirmed as it all 
was by the words and the countenance of his wife fewer and quieter 
but not less to the purpose to know that she thought his coming 
certain was enough to make emma consider it so and sincerely did 
she rejoice in their joy it was a most delightful reanimation 
of exhausted spirits the worn out past was sunk in the freshness 
of what was coming and in the rapidity of half a moment s thought 
she hoped mr elton would now be talked of no more 
mr weston gave her the history of the engagements at enscombe 
which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at 
his command as well as the route and the method of his journey 
and she listened and smiled and congratulated 
i shall soon bring him over to hartfield said he at the conclusion 
emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech 
from his wife 
we had better move on mr weston said she we are detaining 
the girls 
well well i am ready and turning again to emma but you must 
not be expecting such a very fine young man you have only had my 
account you know i dare say he is really nothing extraordinary 
though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very 
different conviction 
emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent and answer 
in a manner that appropriated nothing 
think of me to morrow my dear emma about four of the clock 
was mrs weston s parting injunction spoken with some anxiety 
and meant only for her 
four of the clock depend upon it he will be here by three was mr weston s 
quick amendment and so ended a most satisfactory meeting 
emma s spirits were mounted quite up to happiness every thing wore 
a different air james and his horses seemed not half so sluggish 
as before when she looked at the hedges she thought the elder at 
least must soon be coming out and when she turned round to harriet 
she saw something like a look of spring a tender smile even there 
will mr frank churchill pass through bath as well as oxford 
was a question however which did not augur much 
but neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once 
and emma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come 
in time 
the morning of the interesting day arrived and mrs weston s 
faithful pupil did not forget either at ten or eleven or twelve 
of the clock that she was to think of her at four 
my dear dear anxious friend said she in mental soliloquy 
while walking downstairs from her own room always overcareful 
for every body s comfort but your own i see you now in all your 
little fidgets going again and again into his room to be sure 
that all is right the clock struck twelve as she passed through 
the hall it is twelve i shall not forget to think of you four 
hours hence and by this time to morrow perhaps or a little later 
i may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here 
i am sure they will bring him soon 
she opened the parlour door and saw two gentlemen sitting with 
her father mr weston and his son they had been arrived only 
a few minutes and mr weston had scarcely finished his explanation 
of frank s being a day before his time and her father was yet 
in the midst of his very civil welcome and congratulations when 
she appeared to have her share of surprize introduction and pleasure 
the frank churchill so long talked of so high in interest 
was actually before her he was presented to her and she did 
not think too much had been said in his praise he was a very good 
looking young man height air address all were unexceptionable 
and his countenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness 
of his father s he looked quick and sensible she felt immediately 
that she should like him and there was a well bred ease of manner 
and a readiness to talk which convinced her that he came intending 
to be acquainted with her and that acquainted they soon must be 
he had reached randalls the evening before she was pleased 
with the eagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan 
and travel earlier later and quicker that he might gain half 
a day 
i told you yesterday cried mr weston with exultation i told 
you all that he would be here before the time named i remembered 
what i used to do myself one cannot creep upon a journey 
one cannot help getting on faster than one has planned and the 
pleasure of coming in upon one s friends before the look out begins 
is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs 
it is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it said the young man 
though there are not many houses that i should presume on so far 
but in coming home i felt i might do any thing 
the word home made his father look on him with fresh complacency 
emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable 
the conviction was strengthened by what followed he was very much 
pleased with randalls thought it a most admirably arranged house 
would hardly allow it even to be very small admired the situation 
the walk to highbury highbury itself hartfield still more 
and professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest 
in the country which none but one s own country gives and the 
greatest curiosity to visit it that he should never have been 
able to indulge so amiable a feeling before passed suspiciously 
through emma s brain but still if it were a falsehood it was a 
pleasant one and pleasantly handled his manner had no air of study 
or exaggeration he did really look and speak as if in a state of no 
common enjoyment 
their subjects in general were such as belong to an opening acquaintance 
on his side were the inquiries was she a horsewoman pleasant rides 
pleasant walks had they a large neighbourhood highbury perhaps 
afforded society enough there were several very pretty houses 
in and about it balls had they balls was it a musical society 
but when satisfied on all these points and their acquaintance 
proportionably advanced he contrived to find an opportunity 
while their two fathers were engaged with each other of introducing 
his mother in law and speaking of her with so much handsome praise 
so much warm admiration so much gratitude for the happiness she 
secured to his father and her very kind reception of himself 
as was an additional proof of his knowing how to please 
and of his certainly thinking it worth while to try to please her 
he did not advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be 
thoroughly deserved by mrs weston but undoubtedly he could know 
very little of the matter he understood what would be welcome 
he could be sure of little else his father s marriage he said 
had been the wisest measure every friend must rejoice in it 
and the family from whom he had received such a blessing must 
be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation 
on him 
he got as near as he could to thanking her for miss taylor s merits 
without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it 
was to be rather supposed that miss taylor had formed miss woodhouse s 
character than miss woodhouse miss taylor s and at last as if resolved 
to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object he 
wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person 
elegant agreeable manners i was prepared for said he 
but i confess that considering every thing i had not expected 
more than a very tolerably well looking woman of a certain age 
i did not know that i was to find a pretty young woman in mrs weston 
you cannot see too much perfection in mrs weston for my feelings 
said emma were you to guess her to be eighteen i should listen 
with pleasure but she would be ready to quarrel with you for using 
such words do not let her imagine that you have spoken of her as 
a pretty young woman 
i hope i should know better he replied no depend upon it 
with a gallant bow that in addressing mrs weston i should 
understand whom i might praise without any danger of being thought 
extravagant in my terms 
emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected 
from their knowing each other which had taken strong possession 
of her mind had ever crossed his and whether his compliments were 
to be considered as marks of acquiescence or proofs of defiance 
she must see more of him to understand his ways at present she 
only felt they were agreeable 
she had no doubt of what mr weston was often thinking about 
his quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them 
with a happy expression and even when he might have determined not 
to look she was confident that he was often listening 
her own father s perfect exemption from any thought of the kind 
the entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration 
or suspicion was a most comfortable circumstance happily he 
was not farther from approving matrimony than from foreseeing it 
though always objecting to every marriage that was arranged 
he never suffered beforehand from the apprehension of any 
it seemed as if he could not think so ill of any two persons 
understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it were 
proved against them she blessed the favouring blindness 
he could now without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise 
without a glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest 
give way to all his natural kind hearted civility in solicitous 
inquiries after mr frank churchill s accommodation on his journey 
through the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road and express 
very genuine unmixed anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped 
catching cold which however he could not allow him to feel quite 
assured of himself till after another night 
a reasonable visit paid mr weston began to move he must be going 
he had business at the crown about his hay and a great many errands 
for mrs weston at ford s but he need not hurry any body else 
his son too well bred to hear the hint rose immediately also 
saying 
as you are going farther on business sir i will take the 
opportunity of paying a visit which must be paid some day or other 
and therefore may as well be paid now i have the honour of being 
acquainted with a neighbour of yours turning to emma a lady 
residing in or near highbury a family of the name of fairfax 
i shall have no difficulty i suppose in finding the house 
though fairfax i believe is not the proper name i should rather 
say barnes or bates do you know any family of that name 
to be sure we do cried his father mrs bates we passed her house 
i saw miss bates at the window true true you are acquainted 
with miss fairfax i remember you knew her at weymouth and a fine 
girl she is call upon her by all means 
there is no necessity for my calling this morning said the 
young man another day would do as well but there was that degree 
of acquaintance at weymouth which 
oh go to day go to day do not defer it what is right to be done 
cannot be done too soon and besides i must give you a hint frank 
any want of attention to her here should be carefully avoided 
you saw her with the campbells when she was the equal of every body 
she mixed with but here she is with a poor old grandmother 
who has barely enough to live on if you do not call early it 
will be a slight 
the son looked convinced 
i have heard her speak of the acquaintance said emma she is 
a very elegant young woman 
he agreed to it but with so quiet a yes as inclined her almost 
to doubt his real concurrence and yet there must be a very distinct 
sort of elegance for the fashionable world if jane fairfax could 
be thought only ordinarily gifted with it 
if you were never particularly struck by her manners before 
said she i think you will to day you will see her to advantage 
see her and hear her no i am afraid you will not hear her at all 
for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue 
you are acquainted with miss jane fairfax sir are you 
said mr woodhouse always the last to make his way in conversation 
then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very 
agreeable young lady she is staying here on a visit to her grandmama 
and aunt very worthy people i have known them all my life 
they will be extremely glad to see you i am sure and one of my 
servants shall go with you to shew you the way 
my dear sir upon no account in the world my father can direct me 
but your father is not going so far he is only going to the crown 
quite on the other side of the street and there are a great many houses 
you might be very much at a loss and it is a very dirty walk 
unless you keep on the footpath but my coachman can tell you 
where you had best cross the street 
mr frank churchill still declined it looking as serious as he could 
and his father gave his hearty support by calling out my good friend 
this is quite unnecessary frank knows a puddle of water when he 
sees it and as to mrs bates s he may get there from the crown 
in a hop step and jump 
they were permitted to go alone and with a cordial nod from one 
and a graceful bow from the other the two gentlemen took leave 
emma remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance 
and could now engage to think of them all at randalls any hour of 
the day with full confidence in their comfort 
chapter vi 
the next morning brought mr frank churchill again he came with 
mrs weston to whom and to highbury he seemed to take very cordially 
he had been sitting with her it appeared most companionably at home 
till her usual hour of exercise and on being desired to chuse 
their walk immediately fixed on highbury he did not doubt there 
being very pleasant walks in every direction but if left to him 
he should always chuse the same highbury that airy cheerful 
happy looking highbury would be his constant attraction 
highbury with mrs weston stood for hartfield and she trusted to 
its bearing the same construction with him they walked thither directly 
emma had hardly expected them for mr weston who had called in 
for half a minute in order to hear that his son was very handsome 
knew nothing of their plans and it was an agreeable surprize 
to her therefore to perceive them walking up to the house together 
arm in arm she was wanting to see him again and especially 
to see him in company with mrs weston upon his behaviour to whom 
her opinion of him was to depend if he were deficient there 
nothing should make amends for it but on seeing them together 
she became perfectly satisfied it was not merely in fine words 
or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his duty nothing could be 
more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to her nothing could 
more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as a friend and 
securing her affection and there was time enough for emma to form a 
reasonable judgment as their visit included all the rest of the morning 
they were all three walking about together for an hour or two 
first round the shrubberies of hartfield and afterwards in highbury 
he was delighted with every thing admired hartfield sufficiently 
for mr woodhouse s ear and when their going farther was resolved on 
confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village 
and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than emma 
could have supposed 
some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings 
he begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long 
and which had been the home of his father s father and on recollecting 
that an old woman who had nursed him was still living walked in quest 
of her cottage from one end of the street to the other and though 
in some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit 
they shewed altogether a good will towards highbury in general 
which must be very like a merit to those he was with 
emma watched and decided that with such feelings as were now shewn 
it could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily 
absenting himself that he had not been acting a part or making 
a parade of insincere professions and that mr knightley certainly 
had not done him justice 
their first pause was at the crown inn an inconsiderable house 
though the principal one of the sort where a couple of pair of 
post horses were kept more for the convenience of the neighbourhood 
than from any run on the road and his companions had not expected 
to be detained by any interest excited there but in passing it they 
gave the history of the large room visibly added it had been built 
many years ago for a ball room and while the neighbourhood had been 
in a particularly populous dancing state had been occasionally used 
as such but such brilliant days had long passed away and now the 
highest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist 
club established among the gentlemen and half gentlemen of the place 
he was immediately interested its character as a ball room caught him 
and instead of passing on he stopt for several minutes at the two 
superior sashed windows which were open to look in and contemplate 
its capabilities and lament that its original purpose should 
have ceased he saw no fault in the room he would acknowledge 
none which they suggested no it was long enough broad enough 
handsome enough it would hold the very number for comfort 
they ought to have balls there at least every fortnight through 
the winter why had not miss woodhouse revived the former good 
old days of the room she who could do any thing in highbury 
the want of proper families in the place and the conviction 
that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be 
tempted to attend were mentioned but he was not satisfied 
he could not be persuaded that so many good looking houses as he saw 
around him could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting 
and even when particulars were given and families described he was 
still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture 
would be any thing or that there would be the smallest difficulty 
in every body s returning into their proper place the next morning 
he argued like a young man very much bent on dancing and emma 
was rather surprized to see the constitution of the weston prevail 
so decidedly against the habits of the churchills he seemed to have 
all the life and spirit cheerful feelings and social inclinations 
of his father and nothing of the pride or reserve of enscombe 
of pride indeed there was perhaps scarcely enough his indifference 
to a confusion of rank bordered too much on inelegance of mind 
he could be no judge however of the evil he was holding cheap 
it was but an effusion of lively spirits 
at last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the crown 
and being now almost facing the house where the bateses lodged 
emma recollected his intended visit the day before and asked him 
if he had paid it 
yes oh yes he replied i was just going to mention it 
a very successful visit i saw all the three ladies and felt very 
much obliged to you for your preparatory hint if the talking aunt 
had taken me quite by surprize it must have been the death of me 
as it was i was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit 
ten minutes would have been all that was necessary perhaps all that 
was proper and i had told my father i should certainly be at home 
before him but there was no getting away no pause and to my 
utter astonishment i found when he finding me nowhere else 
joined me there at last that i had been actually sitting with them 
very nearly three quarters of an hour the good lady had not given me 
the possibility of escape before 
and how did you think miss fairfax looking 
ill very ill that is if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill 
but the expression is hardly admissible mrs weston is it 
ladies can never look ill and seriously miss fairfax is naturally 
so pale as almost always to give the appearance of ill health 
a most deplorable want of complexion 
emma would not agree to this and began a warm defence of miss 
fairfax s complexion it was certainly never brilliant but she 
would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general and there was 
a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance 
to the character of her face he listened with all due deference 
acknowledged that he had heard many people say the same but yet he 
must confess that to him nothing could make amends for the want 
of the fine glow of health where features were indifferent 
a fine complexion gave beauty to them all and where they were good 
the effect was fortunately he need not attempt to describe what the 
effect was 
well said emma there is no disputing about taste at least 
you admire her except her complexion 
he shook his head and laughed i cannot separate miss fairfax 
and her complexion 
did you see her often at weymouth were you often in the same society 
at this moment they were approaching ford s and he hastily exclaimed 
ha this must be the very shop that every body attends every day 
of their lives as my father informs me he comes to highbury himself 
he says six days out of the seven and has always business at ford s 
if it be not inconvenient to you pray let us go in that i may prove 
myself to belong to the place to be a true citizen of highbury 
i must buy something at ford s it will be taking out my freedom 
i dare say they sell gloves 
oh yes gloves and every thing i do admire your patriotism 
you will be adored in highbury you were very popular before you came 
because you were mr weston s son but lay out half a guinea at 
ford s and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues 
they went in and while the sleek well tied parcels of men s beavers 
and york tan were bringing down and displaying on the counter 
he said but i beg your pardon miss woodhouse you were speaking 
to me you were saying something at the very moment of this burst 
of my amor patriae do not let me lose it i assure you the utmost 
stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any 
happiness in private life 
i merely asked whether you had known much of miss fairfax 
and her party at weymouth 
and now that i understand your question i must pronounce it to be a 
very unfair one it is always the lady s right to decide on the degree 
of acquaintance miss fairfax must already have given her account 
i shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow 
upon my word you answer as discreetly as she could do herself 
but her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed 
she is so very reserved so very unwilling to give the least 
information about any body that i really think you may say what you 
like of your acquaintance with her 
may i indeed then i will speak the truth and nothing suits me 
so well i met her frequently at weymouth i had known the campbells 
a little in town and at weymouth we were very much in the same set 
colonel campbell is a very agreeable man and mrs campbell a friendly 
warm hearted woman i like them all 
you know miss fairfax s situation in life i conclude what she 
is destined to be 
yes rather hesitatingly i believe i do 
you get upon delicate subjects emma said mrs weston smiling 
remember that i am here mr frank churchill hardly knows 
what to say when you speak of miss fairfax s situation in life 
i will move a little farther off 
i certainly do forget to think of her said emma as having ever 
been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend 
he looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment 
when the gloves were bought and they had quitted the shop again 
did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of play 
said frank churchill 
ever hear her repeated emma you forget how much she belongs 
to highbury i have heard her every year of our lives since we 
both began she plays charmingly 
you think so do you i wanted the opinion of some one who 
could really judge she appeared to me to play well that is 
with considerable taste but i know nothing of the matter myself 
i am excessively fond of music but without the smallest skill 
or right of judging of any body s performance i have been used 
to hear her s admired and i remember one proof of her being 
thought to play well a man a very musical man and in love 
with another woman engaged to her on the point of marriage 
would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument 
if the lady in question could sit down instead never seemed 
to like to hear one if he could hear the other that i thought 
in a man of known musical talent was some proof 
proof indeed said emma highly amused mr dixon is very musical 
is he we shall know more about them all in half an hour from you 
than miss fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year 
yes mr dixon and miss campbell were the persons and i thought 
it a very strong proof 
certainly very strong it was to own the truth a great deal 
stronger than if i had been miss campbell would have been at all 
agreeable to me i could not excuse a man s having more music 
than love more ear than eye a more acute sensibility to fine 
sounds than to my feelings how did miss campbell appear to like it 
it was her very particular friend you know 
poor comfort said emma laughing one would rather have a stranger 
preferred than one s very particular friend with a stranger it might 
not recur again but the misery of having a very particular friend 
always at hand to do every thing better than one does oneself 
poor mrs dixon well i am glad she is gone to settle in ireland 
you are right it was not very flattering to miss campbell 
but she really did not seem to feel it 
so much the better or so much the worse i do not know which 
but be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her quickness of friendship 
or dulness of feeling there was one person i think who must have 
felt it miss fairfax herself she must have felt the improper 
and dangerous distinction 
as to that i do not 
oh do not imagine that i expect an account of miss fairfax s 
sensations from you or from any body else they are known to no 
human being i guess but herself but if she continued to play 
whenever she was asked by mr dixon one may guess what one chuses 
there appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all 
he began rather quickly but checking himself added however it 
is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were 
how it might all be behind the scenes i can only say that there 
was smoothness outwardly but you who have known miss fairfax from 
a child must be a better judge of her character and of how she 
is likely to conduct herself in critical situations than i can be 
i have known her from a child undoubtedly we have been children 
and women together and it is natural to suppose that we should 
be intimate that we should have taken to each other whenever 
she visited her friends but we never did i hardly know how it 
has happened a little perhaps from that wickedness on my side 
which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized 
and so cried up as she always was by her aunt and grandmother 
and all their set and then her reserve i never could attach 
myself to any one so completely reserved 
it is a most repulsive quality indeed said he oftentimes 
very convenient no doubt but never pleasing there is safety 
in reserve but no attraction one cannot love a reserved person 
not till the reserve ceases towards oneself and then the attraction 
may be the greater but i must be more in want of a friend 
or an agreeable companion than i have yet been to take 
the trouble of conquering any body s reserve to procure one 
intimacy between miss fairfax and me is quite out of the question 
i have no reason to think ill of her not the least except that 
such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner 
such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body is apt 
to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal 
he perfectly agreed with her and after walking together so long 
and thinking so much alike emma felt herself so well acquainted with him 
that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting 
he was not exactly what she had expected less of the man of the 
world in some of his notions less of the spoiled child of fortune 
therefore better than she had expected his ideas seemed more moderate 
his feelings warmer she was particularly struck by his manner 
of considering mr elton s house which as well as the church 
he would go and look at and would not join them in finding much 
fault with no he could not believe it a bad house not such a house 
as a man was to be pitied for having if it were to be shared with 
the woman he loved he could not think any man to be pitied for having 
that house there must be ample room in it for every real comfort 
the man must be a blockhead who wanted more 
mrs weston laughed and said he did not know what he was talking about 
used only to a large house himself and without ever thinking how many 
advantages and accommodations were attached to its size he could 
be no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one 
but emma in her own mind determined that he did know what he 
was talking about and that he shewed a very amiable inclination 
to settle early in life and to marry from worthy motives 
he might not be aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be 
occasioned by no housekeeper s room or a bad butler s pantry 
but no doubt he did perfectly feel that enscombe could not make 
him happy and that whenever he were attached he would willingly 
give up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment 
chapter vii 
emma s very good opinion of frank churchill was a little shaken 
the following day by hearing that he was gone off to london 
merely to have his hair cut a sudden freak seemed to have seized him 
at breakfast and he had sent for a chaise and set off intending to 
return to dinner but with no more important view that appeared than 
having his hair cut there was certainly no harm in his travelling 
sixteen miles twice over on such an errand but there was an air 
of foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve it did 
not accord with the rationality of plan the moderation in expense 
or even the unselfish warmth of heart which she had believed herself 
to discern in him yesterday vanity extravagance love of change 
restlessness of temper which must be doing something good or bad 
heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and mrs weston 
indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general he became 
liable to all these charges his father only called him a coxcomb 
and thought it a very good story but that mrs weston did not like it 
was clear enough by her passing it over as quickly as possible 
and making no other comment than that all young people would have 
their little whims 
with the exception of this little blot emma found that his visit 
hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him mrs weston 
was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he 
made himself how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether 
he appeared to have a very open temper certainly a very cheerful 
and lively one she could observe nothing wrong in his notions 
a great deal decidedly right he spoke of his uncle with warm regard 
was fond of talking of him said he would be the best man in the 
world if he were left to himself and though there was no being 
attached to the aunt he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude 
and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect 
this was all very promising and but for such an unfortunate fancy 
for having his hair cut there was nothing to denote him unworthy 
of the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him 
the honour if not of being really in love with her of being 
at least very near it and saved only by her own indifference 
for still her resolution held of never marrying the honour in short 
of being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance 
mr weston on his side added a virtue to the account which must 
have some weight he gave her to understand that frank admired 
her extremely thought her very beautiful and very charming 
and with so much to be said for him altogether she found she must 
not judge him harshly as mrs weston observed all young people 
would have their little whims 
there was one person among his new acquaintance in surry not so 
leniently disposed in general he was judged throughout the parishes 
of donwell and highbury with great candour liberal allowances 
were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man 
one who smiled so often and bowed so well but there was one spirit 
among them not to be softened from its power of censure by bows 
or smiles mr knightley the circumstance was told him at hartfield 
for the moment he was silent but emma heard him almost immediately 
afterwards say to himself over a newspaper he held in his hand 
hum just the trifling silly fellow i took him for she had 
half a mind to resent but an instant s observation convinced 
her that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings 
and not meant to provoke and therefore she let it pass 
although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings 
mr and mrs weston s visit this morning was in another respect 
particularly opportune something occurred while they were 
at hartfield to make emma want their advice and which was 
still more lucky she wanted exactly the advice they gave 
this was the occurrence the coles had been settled some years 
in highbury and were very good sort of people friendly liberal 
and unpretending but on the other hand they were of low origin 
in trade and only moderately genteel on their first coming into 
the country they had lived in proportion to their income quietly 
keeping little company and that little unexpensively but the last 
year or two had brought them a considerable increase of means 
the house in town had yielded greater profits and fortune in general 
had smiled on them with their wealth their views increased 
their want of a larger house their inclination for more company 
they added to their house to their number of servants 
to their expenses of every sort and by this time were in fortune 
and style of living second only to the family at hartfield 
their love of society and their new dining room prepared every body 
for their keeping dinner company and a few parties chiefly among 
the single men had already taken place the regular and best 
families emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite 
neither donwell nor hartfield nor randalls nothing should 
tempt her to go if they did and she regretted that her father s 
known habits would be giving her refusal less meaning than she 
could wish the coles were very respectable in their way but they 
ought to be taught that it was not for them to arrange the terms 
on which the superior families would visit them this lesson 
she very much feared they would receive only from herself 
she had little hope of mr knightley none of mr weston 
but she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many 
weeks before it appeared that when the insult came at last 
it found her very differently affected donwell and randalls 
had received their invitation and none had come for her father 
and herself and mrs weston s accounting for it with i suppose 
they will not take the liberty with you they know you do not 
dine out was not quite sufficient she felt that she should 
like to have had the power of refusal and afterwards as the idea 
of the party to be assembled there consisting precisely of those 
whose society was dearest to her occurred again and again 
she did not know that she might not have been tempted to accept 
harriet was to be there in the evening and the bateses they had 
been speaking of it as they walked about highbury the day before 
and frank churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence 
might not the evening end in a dance had been a question of his 
the bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits 
and her being left in solitary grandeur even supposing the omission 
to be intended as a compliment was but poor comfort 
it was the arrival of this very invitation while the westons were 
at hartfield which made their presence so acceptable for though her 
first remark on reading it was that of course it must be declined 
she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do 
that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful 
she owned that considering every thing she was not absolutely 
without inclination for the party the coles expressed themselves 
so properly there was so much real attention in the manner of it 
so much consideration for her father they would have solicited the 
honour earlier but had been waiting the arrival of a folding screen 
from london which they hoped might keep mr woodhouse from any draught 
of air and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the 
honour of his company upon the whole she was very persuadable 
and it being briefly settled among themselves how it might be 
done without neglecting his comfort how certainly mrs goddard 
if not mrs bates might be depended on for bearing him company 
mr woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of his daughter s 
going out to dinner on a day now near at hand and spending 
the whole evening away from him as for his going emma did 
not wish him to think it possible the hours would be too late 
and the party too numerous he was soon pretty well resigned 
i am not fond of dinner visiting said he i never was 
no more is emma late hours do not agree with us i am sorry 
mr and mrs cole should have done it i think it would be 
much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer 
and take their tea with us take us in their afternoon walk 
which they might do as our hours are so reasonable and yet get home 
without being out in the damp of the evening the dews of a summer 
evening are what i would not expose any body to however as they 
are so very desirous to have dear emma dine with them and as you 
will both be there and mr knightley too to take care of her 
i cannot wish to prevent it provided the weather be what it ought 
neither damp nor cold nor windy then turning to mrs weston 
with a look of gentle reproach ah miss taylor if you had 
not married you would have staid at home with me 
well sir cried mr weston as i took miss taylor away 
it is incumbent on me to supply her place if i can and i will 
step to mrs goddard in a moment if you wish it 
but the idea of any thing to be done in a moment was increasing 
not lessening mr woodhouse s agitation the ladies knew better 
how to allay it mr weston must be quiet and every thing 
deliberately arranged 
with this treatment mr woodhouse was soon composed enough 
for talking as usual he should be happy to see mrs goddard 
he had a great regard for mrs goddard and emma should write a line 
and invite her james could take the note but first of all 
there must be an answer written to mrs cole 
you will make my excuses my dear as civilly as possible you will 
say that i am quite an invalid and go no where and therefore must 
decline their obliging invitation beginning with my compliments 
of course but you will do every thing right i need not tell you 
what is to be done we must remember to let james know that the carriage 
will be wanted on tuesday i shall have no fears for you with him 
we have never been there above once since the new approach was made 
but still i have no doubt that james will take you very safely 
and when you get there you must tell him at what time you would 
have him come for you again and you had better name an early hour 
you will not like staying late you will get very tired when tea 
is over 
but you would not wish me to come away before i am tired papa 
oh no my love but you will soon be tired there will be 
a great many people talking at once you will not like the noise 
but my dear sir cried mr weston if emma comes away early 
it will be breaking up the party 
and no great harm if it does said mr woodhouse the sooner 
every party breaks up the better 
but you do not consider how it may appear to the coles 
emma s going away directly after tea might be giving offence 
they are good natured people and think little of their own claims 
but still they must feel that any body s hurrying away is no 
great compliment and miss woodhouse s doing it would be more thought 
of than any other person s in the room you would not wish to disappoint 
and mortify the coles i am sure sir friendly good sort of people 
as ever lived and who have been your neighbours these ten years 
no upon no account in the world mr weston i am much obliged 
to you for reminding me i should be extremely sorry to be giving 
them any pain i know what worthy people they are perry tells 
me that mr cole never touches malt liquor you would not think 
it to look at him but he is bilious mr cole is very bilious 
no i would not be the means of giving them any pain my dear emma 
we must consider this i am sure rather than run the risk of hurting 
mr and mrs cole you would stay a little longer than you might wish 
you will not regard being tired you will be perfectly safe 
you know among your friends 
oh yes papa i have no fears at all for myself and i should have 
no scruples of staying as late as mrs weston but on your account 
i am only afraid of your sitting up for me i am not afraid 
of your not being exceedingly comfortable with mrs goddard 
she loves piquet you know but when she is gone home i am afraid 
you will be sitting up by yourself instead of going to bed at your 
usual time and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort 
you must promise me not to sit up 
he did on the condition of some promises on her side such as that 
if she came home cold she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly 
if hungry that she would take something to eat that her own maid 
should sit up for her and that serle and the butler should see 
that every thing were safe in the house as usual 
chapter viii 
frank churchill came back again and if he kept his father s 
dinner waiting it was not known at hartfield for mrs weston 
was too anxious for his being a favourite with mr woodhouse 
to betray any imperfection which could be concealed 
he came back had had his hair cut and laughed at himself with 
a very good grace but without seeming really at all ashamed 
of what he had done he had no reason to wish his hair longer 
to conceal any confusion of face no reason to wish the money unspent 
to improve his spirits he was quite as undaunted and as lively 
as ever and after seeing him emma thus moralised to herself 
i do not know whether it ought to be so but certainly silly things 
do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an 
impudent way wickedness is always wickedness but folly is not 
always folly it depends upon the character of those who handle it 
mr knightley he is not a trifling silly young man if he were 
he would have done this differently he would either have gloried 
in the achievement or been ashamed of it there would have been 
either the ostentation of a coxcomb or the evasions of a mind too 
weak to defend its own vanities no i am perfectly sure that he 
is not trifling or silly 
with tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again 
and for a longer time than hitherto of judging of his general manners 
and by inference of the meaning of his manners towards herself 
of guessing how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness 
into her air and of fancying what the observations of all those 
might be who were now seeing them together for the first time 
she meant to be very happy in spite of the scene being laid at 
mr cole s and without being able to forget that among the failings 
of mr elton even in the days of his favour none had disturbed 
her more than his propensity to dine with mr cole 
her father s comfort was amply secured mrs bates as well as 
mrs goddard being able to come and her last pleasing duty 
before she left the house was to pay her respects to them as 
they sat together after dinner and while her father was fondly 
noticing the beauty of her dress to make the two ladies all 
the amends in her power by helping them to large slices of cake 
and full glasses of wine for whatever unwilling self denial his 
care of their constitution might have obliged them to practise 
during the meal she had provided a plentiful dinner for them 
she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat it 
she followed another carriage to mr cole s door and was pleased 
to see that it was mr knightley s for mr knightley keeping 
no horses having little spare money and a great deal of health 
activity and independence was too apt in emma s opinion to get 
about as he could and not use his carriage so often as became 
the owner of donwell abbey she had an opportunity now of speaking 
her approbation while warm from her heart for he stopped to hand her out 
this is coming as you should do said she like a gentleman 
i am quite glad to see you 
he thanked her observing how lucky that we should arrive at the same 
moment for if we had met first in the drawing room i doubt whether 
you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual 
you might not have distinguished how i came by my look or manner 
yes i should i am sure i should there is always a look of 
consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know 
to be beneath them you think you carry it off very well i dare say 
but with you it is a sort of bravado an air of affected unconcern 
i always observe it whenever i meet you under those circumstances 
now you have nothing to try for you are not afraid of being 
supposed ashamed you are not striving to look taller than any 
body else now i shall really be very happy to walk into the same 
room with you 
nonsensical girl was his reply but not at all in anger 
emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party 
as with mr knightley she was received with a cordial respect 
which could not but please and given all the consequence she could 
wish for when the westons arrived the kindest looks of love 
the strongest of admiration were for her from both husband and wife 
the son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which marked 
her as his peculiar object and at dinner she found him seated 
by her and as she firmly believed not without some dexterity 
on his side 
the party was rather large as it included one other family a proper 
unobjectionable country family whom the coles had the advantage of 
naming among their acquaintance and the male part of mr cox s family 
the lawyer of highbury the less worthy females were to come 
in the evening with miss bates miss fairfax and miss smith 
but already at dinner they were too numerous for any subject 
of conversation to be general and while politics and mr elton 
were talked over emma could fairly surrender all her attention to 
the pleasantness of her neighbour the first remote sound to which 
she felt herself obliged to attend was the name of jane fairfax 
mrs cole seemed to be relating something of her that was expected to be 
very interesting she listened and found it well worth listening to 
that very dear part of emma her fancy received an amusing supply 
mrs cole was telling that she had been calling on miss bates 
and as soon as she entered the room had been struck by the sight 
of a pianoforte a very elegant looking instrument not a grand 
but a large sized square pianoforte and the substance of the story 
the end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize and inquiry 
and congratulations on her side and explanations on miss bates s was 
that this pianoforte had arrived from broadwood s the day before 
to the great astonishment of both aunt and niece entirely unexpected 
that at first by miss bates s account jane herself was quite at 
a loss quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it 
but now they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only 
one quarter of course it must be from colonel campbell 
one can suppose nothing else added mrs cole and i was only 
surprized that there could ever have been a doubt but jane 
it seems had a letter from them very lately and not a word was said 
about it she knows their ways best but i should not consider their 
silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present 
they might chuse to surprize her 
mrs cole had many to agree with her every body who spoke on the 
subject was equally convinced that it must come from colonel campbell 
and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made and there 
were enough ready to speak to allow emma to think her own way 
and still listen to mrs cole 
i declare i do not know when i have heard any thing that has given 
me more satisfaction it always has quite hurt me that jane fairfax 
who plays so delightfully should not have an instrument 
it seemed quite a shame especially considering how many houses 
there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away 
this is like giving ourselves a slap to be sure and it was 
but yesterday i was telling mr cole i really was ashamed 
to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing room while i 
do not know one note from another and our little girls who are 
but just beginning perhaps may never make any thing of it 
and there is poor jane fairfax who is mistress of music has not 
any thing of the nature of an instrument not even the pitifullest 
old spinet in the world to amuse herself with i was saying this 
to mr cole but yesterday and he quite agreed with me only he 
is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging 
himself in the purchase hoping that some of our good neighbours might 
be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can 
and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought 
or else i am sure we ought to be ashamed of it we are in great 
hopes that miss woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening 
miss woodhouse made the proper acquiescence and finding that nothing 
more was to be entrapped from any communication of mrs cole s 
turned to frank churchill 
why do you smile said she 
nay why do you 
me i suppose i smile for pleasure at colonel campbell s being 
so rich and so liberal it is a handsome present 
very 
i rather wonder that it was never made before 
perhaps miss fairfax has never been staying here so long before 
or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument 
which must now be shut up in london untouched by any body 
that is a grand pianoforte and he might think it too large 
for mrs bates s house 
you may say what you chuse but your countenance testifies 
that your thoughts on this subject are very much like mine 
i do not know i rather believe you are giving me more credit for 
acuteness than i deserve i smile because you smile and shall probably 
suspect whatever i find you suspect but at present i do not see what 
there is to question if colonel campbell is not the person who can be 
what do you say to mrs dixon 
mrs dixon very true indeed i had not thought of mrs dixon 
she must know as well as her father how acceptable an instrument 
would be and perhaps the mode of it the mystery the surprize 
is more like a young woman s scheme than an elderly man s it 
is mrs dixon i dare say i told you that your suspicions would 
guide mine 
if so you must extend your suspicions and comprehend mr dixon 
in them 
mr dixon very well yes i immediately perceive that it must 
be the joint present of mr and mrs dixon we were speaking the 
other day you know of his being so warm an admirer of her performance 
yes and what you told me on that head confirmed an idea which i 
had entertained before i do not mean to reflect upon the good 
intentions of either mr dixon or miss fairfax but i cannot help 
suspecting either that after making his proposals to her friend 
he had the misfortune to fall in love with her or that he became 
conscious of a little attachment on her side one might guess 
twenty things without guessing exactly the right but i am sure 
there must be a particular because for her chusing to come to highbury 
instead of going with the campbells to ireland here she must be 
leading a life of privation and penance there it would have been 
all enjoyment as to the pretence of trying her native air i look 
upon that as a mere excuse in the summer it might have passed 
but what can any body s native air do for them in the months 
of january february and march good fires and carriages would 
be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health and i 
dare say in her s i do not require you to adopt all my suspicions 
though you make so noble a profession of doing it but i honestly 
tell you what they are 
and upon my word they have an air of great probability 
mr dixon s preference of her music to her friend s i can answer 
for being very decided 
and then he saved her life did you ever hear of that 
a water party and by some accident she was falling overboard 
he caught her 
he did i was there one of the party 
were you really well but you observed nothing of course 
for it seems to be a new idea to you if i had been there i think 
i should have made some discoveries 
i dare say you would but i simple i saw nothing but the fact 
that miss fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that mr dixon 
caught her it was the work of a moment and though the consequent 
shock and alarm was very great and much more durable indeed i 
believe it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again 
yet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar 
anxiety to be observable i do not mean to say however that you 
might not have made discoveries 
the conversation was here interrupted they were called on to share 
in the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses 
and obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others but when 
the table was again safely covered when every corner dish was placed 
exactly right and occupation and ease were generally restored 
emma said 
the arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me i wanted to know 
a little more and this tells me quite enough depend upon it 
we shall soon hear that it is a present from mr and mrs dixon 
and if the dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we 
must conclude it to come from the campbells 
no i am sure it is not from the campbells miss fairfax knows it 
is not from the campbells or they would have been guessed at first 
she would not have been puzzled had she dared fix on them 
i may not have convinced you perhaps but i am perfectly convinced 
myself that mr dixon is a principal in the business 
indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced your reasonings 
carry my judgment along with them entirely at first while i 
supposed you satisfied that colonel campbell was the giver i saw 
it only as paternal kindness and thought it the most natural thing 
in the world but when you mentioned mrs dixon i felt how much more 
probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship 
and now i can see it in no other light than as an offering of love 
there was no occasion to press the matter farther the conviction 
seemed real he looked as if he felt it she said no more 
other subjects took their turn and the rest of the dinner passed away 
the dessert succeeded the children came in and were talked 
to and admired amid the usual rate of conversation a few clever 
things said a few downright silly but by much the larger proportion 
neither the one nor the other nothing worse than everyday remarks 
dull repetitions old news and heavy jokes 
the ladies had not been long in the drawing room before the other ladies 
in their different divisions arrived emma watched the entree of her 
own particular little friend and if she could not exult in her dignity 
and grace she could not only love the blooming sweetness and the 
artless manner but could most heartily rejoice in that light cheerful 
unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many alleviations 
of pleasure in the midst of the pangs of disappointed affection 
there she sat and who would have guessed how many tears she had 
been lately shedding to be in company nicely dressed herself 
and seeing others nicely dressed to sit and smile and look pretty 
and say nothing was enough for the happiness of the present hour 
jane fairfax did look and move superior but emma suspected she 
might have been glad to change feelings with harriet very glad 
to have purchased the mortification of having loved yes of having 
loved even mr elton in vain by the surrender of all the dangerous 
pleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her friend 
in so large a party it was not necessary that emma should approach her 
she did not wish to speak of the pianoforte she felt too much 
in the secret herself to think the appearance of curiosity 
or interest fair and therefore purposely kept at a distance 
but by the others the subject was almost immediately introduced 
and she saw the blush of consciousness with which congratulations 
were received the blush of guilt which accompanied the name of my 
excellent friend colonel campbell 
mrs weston kind hearted and musical was particularly interested 
by the circumstance and emma could not help being amused at her 
perseverance in dwelling on the subject and having so much to ask 
and to say as to tone touch and pedal totally unsuspicious 
of that wish of saying as little about it as possible which she 
plainly read in the fair heroine s countenance 
they were soon joined by some of the gentlemen and the very first of the 
early was frank churchill in he walked the first and the handsomest 
and after paying his compliments en passant to miss bates and 
her niece made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle 
where sat miss woodhouse and till he could find a seat by her 
would not sit at all emma divined what every body present must 
be thinking she was his object and every body must perceive it 
she introduced him to her friend miss smith and at convenient 
moments afterwards heard what each thought of the other he had 
never seen so lovely a face and was delighted with her naivete 
and she only to be sure it was paying him too great a compliment 
but she did think there were some looks a little like mr elton 
emma restrained her indignation and only turned from her in silence 
smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first 
glancing towards miss fairfax but it was most prudent to avoid speech 
he told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining room 
hated sitting long was always the first to move when he could 
that his father mr knightley mr cox and mr cole were left 
very busy over parish business that as long as he had staid 
however it had been pleasant enough as he had found them in general 
a set of gentlemanlike sensible men and spoke so handsomely of 
highbury altogether thought it so abundant in agreeable families 
that emma began to feel she had been used to despise the place 
rather too much she questioned him as to the society in yorkshire 
the extent of the neighbourhood about enscombe and the sort 
and could make out from his answers that as far as enscombe 
was concerned there was very little going on that their visitings 
were among a range of great families none very near and that even 
when days were fixed and invitations accepted it was an even 
chance that mrs churchill were not in health and spirits for going 
that they made a point of visiting no fresh person and that 
though he had his separate engagements it was not without difficulty 
without considerable address at times that he could get away 
or introduce an acquaintance for a night 
she saw that enscombe could not satisfy and that highbury 
taken at its best might reasonably please a young man who had more 
retirement at home than he liked his importance at enscombe was 
very evident he did not boast but it naturally betrayed itself 
that he had persuaded his aunt where his uncle could do nothing 
and on her laughing and noticing it he owned that he believed excepting 
one or two points he could with time persuade her to any thing 
one of those points on which his influence failed he then mentioned 
he had wanted very much to go abroad had been very eager indeed 
to be allowed to travel but she would not hear of it this had 
happened the year before now he said he was beginning to have 
no longer the same wish 
the unpersuadable point which he did not mention emma guessed 
to be good behaviour to his father 
i have made a most wretched discovery said he after a short pause 
i have been here a week to morrow half my time i never knew 
days fly so fast a week to morrow and i have hardly begun to 
enjoy myself but just got acquainted with mrs weston and others 
i hate the recollection 
perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day 
out of so few in having your hair cut 
no said he smiling that is no subject of regret at all 
i have no pleasure in seeing my friends unless i can believe myself 
fit to be seen 
the rest of the gentlemen being now in the room emma found herself 
obliged to turn from him for a few minutes and listen to mr cole 
when mr cole had moved away and her attention could be restored 
as before she saw frank churchill looking intently across the room 
at miss fairfax who was sitting exactly opposite 
what is the matter said she 
he started thank you for rousing me he replied i believe 
i have been very rude but really miss fairfax has done her hair 
in so odd a way so very odd a way that i cannot keep my eyes 
from her i never saw any thing so outree those curls this must 
be a fancy of her own i see nobody else looking like her 
i must go and ask her whether it is an irish fashion shall i 
yes i will i declare i will and you shall see how she takes it 
whether she colours 
he was gone immediately and emma soon saw him standing before miss 
fairfax and talking to her but as to its effect on the young lady 
as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them exactly 
in front of miss fairfax she could absolutely distinguish nothing 
before he could return to his chair it was taken by mrs weston 
this is the luxury of a large party said she one can get 
near every body and say every thing my dear emma i am longing 
to talk to you i have been making discoveries and forming plans 
just like yourself and i must tell them while the idea is fresh 
do you know how miss bates and her niece came here 
how they were invited were not they 
oh yes but how they were conveyed hither the manner of their coming 
they walked i conclude how else could they come 
very true well a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad 
it would be to have jane fairfax walking home again late at night 
and cold as the nights are now and as i looked at her though i 
never saw her appear to more advantage it struck me that she 
was heated and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold 
poor girl i could not bear the idea of it so as soon as mr weston 
came into the room and i could get at him i spoke to him about 
the carriage you may guess how readily he came into my wishes 
and having his approbation i made my way directly to miss bates 
to assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took 
us home for i thought it would be making her comfortable at once 
good soul she was as grateful as possible you may be sure 
nobody was ever so fortunate as herself but with many 
many thanks there was no occasion to trouble us for mr knightley s 
carriage had brought and was to take them home again i was 
quite surprized very glad i am sure but really quite surprized 
such a very kind attention and so thoughtful an attention 
the sort of thing that so few men would think of and in short 
from knowing his usual ways i am very much inclined to think 
that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all 
i do suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself 
and that it was only as an excuse for assisting them 
very likely said emma nothing more likely i know no man 
more likely than mr knightley to do the sort of thing to do any 
thing really good natured useful considerate or benevolent 
he is not a gallant man but he is a very humane one and this 
considering jane fairfax s ill health would appear a case 
of humanity to him and for an act of unostentatious kindness 
there is nobody whom i would fix on more than on mr knightley 
i know he had horses to day for we arrived together and i laughed at 
him about it but he said not a word that could betray 
well said mrs weston smiling you give him credit for 
more simple disinterested benevolence in this instance than i do 
for while miss bates was speaking a suspicion darted into my head 
and i have never been able to get it out again the more i think 
of it the more probable it appears in short i have made a match 
between mr knightley and jane fairfax see the consequence 
of keeping you company what do you say to it 
mr knightley and jane fairfax exclaimed emma dear mrs weston 
how could you think of such a thing mr knightley mr knightley 
must not marry you would not have little henry cut out from donwell 
oh no no henry must have donwell i cannot at all consent to 
mr knightley s marrying and i am sure it is not at all likely 
i am amazed that you should think of such a thing 
my dear emma i have told you what led me to think of it 
i do not want the match i do not want to injure dear little henry 
but the idea has been given me by circumstances and if mr knightley 
really wished to marry you would not have him refrain on henry s 
account a boy of six years old who knows nothing of the matter 
yes i would i could not bear to have henry supplanted 
mr knightley marry no i have never had such an idea and i 
cannot adopt it now and jane fairfax too of all women 
nay she has always been a first favourite with him as you 
very well know 
but the imprudence of such a match 
i am not speaking of its prudence merely its probability 
i see no probability in it unless you have any better foundation 
than what you mention his good nature his humanity as i tell you 
would be quite enough to account for the horses he has a great 
regard for the bateses you know independent of jane fairfax 
and is always glad to shew them attention my dear mrs weston 
do not take to match making you do it very ill jane fairfax mistress 
of the abbey oh no no every feeling revolts for his own sake 
i would not have him do so mad a thing 
imprudent if you please but not mad excepting inequality of fortune 
and perhaps a little disparity of age i can see nothing unsuitable 
but mr knightley does not want to marry i am sure he has not the 
least idea of it do not put it into his head why should he marry 
he is as happy as possible by himself with his farm and his sheep 
and his library and all the parish to manage and he is extremely 
fond of his brother s children he has no occasion to marry 
either to fill up his time or his heart 
my dear emma as long as he thinks so it is so but if he really 
loves jane fairfax 
nonsense he does not care about jane fairfax in the way 
of love i am sure he does not he would do any good to her 
or her family but 
well said mrs weston laughing perhaps the greatest good he 
could do them would be to give jane such a respectable home 
if it would be good to her i am sure it would be evil to himself 
a very shameful and degrading connexion how would he bear to have 
miss bates belonging to him to have her haunting the abbey 
and thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying jane 
so very kind and obliging but he always had been such a very 
kind neighbour and then fly off through half a sentence 
to her mother s old petticoat not that it was such a very old 
petticoat either for still it would last a great while and indeed 
she must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong 
for shame emma do not mimic her you divert me against 
my conscience and upon my word i do not think mr knightley would 
be much disturbed by miss bates little things do not irritate him 
she might talk on and if he wanted to say any thing himself he would 
only talk louder and drown her voice but the question is not 
whether it would be a bad connexion for him but whether he wishes it 
and i think he does i have heard him speak and so must you 
so very highly of jane fairfax the interest he takes in her 
his anxiety about her health his concern that she should have no 
happier prospect i have heard him express himself so warmly on 
those points such an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte 
and of her voice i have heard him say that he could listen to her 
for ever oh and i had almost forgotten one idea that occurred 
to me this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody 
though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present 
from the campbells may it not be from mr knightley i cannot 
help suspecting him i think he is just the person to do it 
even without being in love 
then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love 
but i do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do 
mr knightley does nothing mysteriously 
i have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly 
oftener than i should suppose such a circumstance would in the common 
course of things occur to him 
very well and if he had intended to give her one he would have 
told her so 
there might be scruples of delicacy my dear emma i have a very 
strong notion that it comes from him i am sure he was particularly 
silent when mrs cole told us of it at dinner 
you take up an idea mrs weston and run away with it as you have 
many a time reproached me with doing i see no sign of attachment 
i believe nothing of the pianoforte and proof only shall convince 
me that mr knightley has any thought of marrying jane fairfax 
they combated the point some time longer in the same way emma rather 
gaining ground over the mind of her friend for mrs weston was 
the most used of the two to yield till a little bustle in the room 
shewed them that tea was over and the instrument in preparation 
and at the same moment mr cole approaching to entreat miss woodhouse 
would do them the honour of trying it frank churchill of whom 
in the eagerness of her conversation with mrs weston she had been 
seeing nothing except that he had found a seat by miss fairfax 
followed mr cole to add his very pressing entreaties and as 
in every respect it suited emma best to lead she gave a very 
proper compliance 
she knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt 
more than she could perform with credit she wanted neither taste 
nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable 
and could accompany her own voice well one accompaniment to her song 
took her agreeably by surprize a second slightly but correctly 
taken by frank churchill her pardon was duly begged at the close 
of the song and every thing usual followed he was accused 
of having a delightful voice and a perfect knowledge of music 
which was properly denied and that he knew nothing of the matter 
and had no voice at all roundly asserted they sang together 
once more and emma would then resign her place to miss fairfax 
whose performance both vocal and instrumental she never could 
attempt to conceal from herself was infinitely superior to her own 
with mixed feelings she seated herself at a little distance from the 
numbers round the instrument to listen frank churchill sang again 
they had sung together once or twice it appeared at weymouth 
but the sight of mr knightley among the most attentive soon drew 
away half emma s mind and she fell into a train of thinking 
on the subject of mrs weston s suspicions to which the sweet 
sounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions 
her objections to mr knightley s marrying did not in the least subside 
she could see nothing but evil in it it would be a great 
disappointment to mr john knightley consequently to isabella 
a real injury to the children a most mortifying change 
and material loss to them all a very great deduction from her 
father s daily comfort and as to herself she could not at all 
endure the idea of jane fairfax at donwell abbey a mrs knightley 
for them all to give way to no mr knightley must never marry 
little henry must remain the heir of donwell 
presently mr knightley looked back and came and sat down by her 
they talked at first only of the performance his admiration 
was certainly very warm yet she thought but for mrs weston 
it would not have struck her as a sort of touchstone however 
she began to speak of his kindness in conveying the aunt and niece 
and though his answer was in the spirit of cutting the matter short 
she believed it to indicate only his disinclination to dwell on any 
kindness of his own 
i often feel concern said she that i dare not make our carriage 
more useful on such occasions it is not that i am without the wish 
but you know how impossible my father would deem it that james 
should put to for such a purpose 
quite out of the question quite out of the question he replied 
but you must often wish it i am sure and he smiled with such 
seeming pleasure at the conviction that she must proceed another step 
this present from the campbells said she this pianoforte 
is very kindly given 
yes he replied and without the smallest apparent embarrassment 
but they would have done better had they given her notice of it 
surprizes are foolish things the pleasure is not enhanced and the 
inconvenience is often considerable i should have expected better 
judgment in colonel campbell 
from that moment emma could have taken her oath that mr knightley 
had had no concern in giving the instrument but whether he 
were entirely free from peculiar attachment whether there 
were no actual preference remained a little longer doubtful 
towards the end of jane s second song her voice grew thick 
that will do said he when it was finished thinking aloud 
you have sung quite enough for one evening now be quiet 
another song however was soon begged for one more they would 
not fatigue miss fairfax on any account and would only ask for 
one more and frank churchill was heard to say i think you could 
manage this without effort the first part is so very trifling 
the strength of the song falls on the second 
mr knightley grew angry 
that fellow said he indignantly thinks of nothing but shewing 
off his own voice this must not be and touching miss bates 
who at that moment passed near miss bates are you mad to let 
your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner go and interfere 
they have no mercy on her 
miss bates in her real anxiety for jane could hardly stay even 
to be grateful before she stept forward and put an end to all 
farther singing here ceased the concert part of the evening 
for miss woodhouse and miss fairfax were the only young lady performers 
but soon within five minutes the proposal of dancing 
originating nobody exactly knew where was so effectually promoted 
by mr and mrs cole that every thing was rapidly clearing away 
to give proper space mrs weston capital in her country dances 
was seated and beginning an irresistible waltz and frank churchill 
coming up with most becoming gallantry to emma had secured her hand 
and led her up to the top 
while waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off 
emma found time in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her 
voice and her taste to look about and see what became of mr knightley 
this would be a trial he was no dancer in general if he were to be 
very alert in engaging jane fairfax now it might augur something 
there was no immediate appearance no he was talking to mrs cole 
he was looking on unconcerned jane was asked by somebody else 
and he was still talking to mrs cole 
emma had no longer an alarm for henry his interest was yet safe 
and she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment 
not more than five couple could be mustered but the rarity and the 
suddenness of it made it very delightful and she found herself well 
matched in a partner they were a couple worth looking at 
two dances unfortunately were all that could be allowed 
it was growing late and miss bates became anxious to get home 
on her mother s account after some attempts therefore to be 
permitted to begin again they were obliged to thank mrs weston 
look sorrowful and have done 
perhaps it is as well said frank churchill as he attended emma 
to her carriage i must have asked miss fairfax and her languid 
dancing would not have agreed with me after your s 
chapter ix 
emma did not repent her condescension in going to the coles 
the visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day 
and all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side 
of dignified seclusion must be amply repaid in the splendour 
of popularity she must have delighted the coles worthy people 
who deserved to be made happy and left a name behind her that would 
not soon die away 
perfect happiness even in memory is not common and there were 
two points on which she was not quite easy she doubted whether 
she had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman in betraying 
her suspicions of jane fairfax s feelings to frank churchill 
it was hardly right but it had been so strong an idea that it 
would escape her and his submission to all that she told 
was a compliment to her penetration which made it difficult 
for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue 
the other circumstance of regret related also to jane fairfax 
and there she had no doubt she did unfeignedly and unequivocally 
regret the inferiority of her own playing and singing she did 
most heartily grieve over the idleness of her childhood and sat 
down and practised vigorously an hour and a half 
she was then interrupted by harriet s coming in and if harriet s 
praise could have satisfied her she might soon have been comforted 
oh if i could but play as well as you and miss fairfax 
do not class us together harriet my playing is no more like 
her s than a lamp is like sunshine 
oh dear i think you play the best of the two i think you play 
quite as well as she does i am sure i had much rather hear you 
every body last night said how well you played 
those who knew any thing about it must have felt the difference 
the truth is harriet that my playing is just good enough to be praised 
but jane fairfax s is much beyond it 
well i always shall think that you play quite as well as she does 
or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out 
mr cole said how much taste you had and mr frank churchill talked 
a great deal about your taste and that he valued taste much more 
than execution 
ah but jane fairfax has them both harriet 
are you sure i saw she had execution but i did not know she had 
any taste nobody talked about it and i hate italian singing 
there is no understanding a word of it besides if she does play 
so very well you know it is no more than she is obliged to do 
because she will have to teach the coxes were wondering last night 
whether she would get into any great family how did you think the 
coxes looked 
just as they always do very vulgar 
they told me something said harriet rather hesitatingly 
but it is nothing of any consequence 
emma was obliged to ask what they had told her though fearful 
of its producing mr elton 
they told me that mr martin dined with them last saturday 
oh 
he came to their father upon some business and he asked him 
to stay to dinner 
oh 
they talked a great deal about him especially anne cox 
i do not know what she meant but she asked me if i thought i 
should go and stay there again next summer 
she meant to be impertinently curious just as such an anne cox 
should be 
she said he was very agreeable the day he dined there he sat 
by her at dinner miss nash thinks either of the coxes would 
be very glad to marry him 
very likely i think they are without exception the most vulgar 
girls in highbury 
harriet had business at ford s emma thought it most prudent to go 
with her another accidental meeting with the martins was possible 
and in her present state would be dangerous 
harriet tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word was always 
very long at a purchase and while she was still hanging over muslins 
and changing her mind emma went to the door for amusement much could 
not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of highbury 
mr perry walking hastily by mr william cox letting himself in at 
the office door mr cole s carriage horses returning from exercise 
or a stray letter boy on an obstinate mule were the liveliest 
objects she could presume to expect and when her eyes fell only on 
the butcher with his tray a tidy old woman travelling homewards from 
shop with her full basket two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone 
and a string of dawdling children round the baker s little bow window 
eyeing the gingerbread she knew she had no reason to complain 
and was amused enough quite enough still to stand at the door 
a mind lively and at ease can do with seeing nothing and can see 
nothing that does not answer 
she looked down the randalls road the scene enlarged 
two persons appeared mrs weston and her son in law they were 
walking into highbury to hartfield of course they were stopping 
however in the first place at mrs bates s whose house was 
a little nearer randalls than ford s and had all but knocked 
when emma caught their eye immediately they crossed the road 
and came forward to her and the agreeableness of yesterday s 
engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present meeting 
mrs weston informed her that she was going to call on the bateses 
in order to hear the new instrument 
for my companion tells me said she that i absolutely promised 
miss bates last night that i would come this morning i was 
not aware of it myself i did not know that i had fixed a day 
but as he says i did i am going now 
and while mrs weston pays her visit i may be allowed i hope 
said frank churchill to join your party and wait for her at hartfield 
if you are going home 
mrs weston was disappointed 
i thought you meant to go with me they would be very much pleased 
me i should be quite in the way but perhaps i may be equally 
in the way here miss woodhouse looks as if she did not want me 
my aunt always sends me off when she is shopping she says i fidget 
her to death and miss woodhouse looks as if she could almost say 
the same what am i to do 
i am here on no business of my own said emma i am only waiting 
for my friend she will probably have soon done and then we 
shall go home but you had better go with mrs weston and hear 
the instrument 
well if you advise it but with a smile if colonel campbell 
should have employed a careless friend and if it should prove 
to have an indifferent tone what shall i say i shall be no 
support to mrs weston she might do very well by herself 
a disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips but i 
am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood 
i do not believe any such thing replied emma i am persuaded 
that you can be as insincere as your neighbours when it is necessary 
but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent 
quite otherwise indeed if i understood miss fairfax s opinion 
last night 
do come with me said mrs weston if it be not very disagreeable 
to you it need not detain us long we will go to hartfield afterwards 
we will follow them to hartfield i really wish you to call with me 
it will be felt so great an attention and i always thought you 
meant it 
he could say no more and with the hope of hartfield to reward him 
returned with mrs weston to mrs bates s door emma watched them in 
and then joined harriet at the interesting counter trying with all 
the force of her own mind to convince her that if she wanted plain 
muslin it was of no use to look at figured and that a blue ribbon 
be it ever so beautiful would still never match her yellow pattern 
at last it was all settled even to the destination of the parcel 
should i send it to mrs goddard s madam asked mrs ford 
yes no yes to mrs goddard s only my pattern gown is 
at hartfield no you shall send it to hartfield if you please 
but then mrs goddard will want to see it and i could take the 
pattern gown home any day but i shall want the ribbon directly 
so it had better go to hartfield at least the ribbon you could 
make it into two parcels mrs ford could not you 
it is not worth while harriet to give mrs ford the trouble 
of two parcels 
no more it is 
no trouble in the world madam said the obliging mrs ford 
oh but indeed i would much rather have it only in one 
then if you please you shall send it all to mrs goddard s 
i do not know no i think miss woodhouse i may just as well 
have it sent to hartfield and take it home with me at night 
what do you advise 
that you do not give another half second to the subject 
to hartfield if you please mrs ford 
aye that will be much best said harriet quite satisfied 
i should not at all like to have it sent to mrs goddard s 
voices approached the shop or rather one voice and two ladies 
mrs weston and miss bates met them at the door 
my dear miss woodhouse said the latter i am just run across to 
entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while 
and give us your opinion of our new instrument you and miss smith 
how do you do miss smith very well i thank you and i begged 
mrs weston to come with me that i might be sure of succeeding 
i hope mrs bates and miss fairfax are 
very well i am much obliged to you my mother is delightfully well 
and jane caught no cold last night how is mr woodhouse i am so glad 
to hear such a good account mrs weston told me you were here 
oh then said i i must run across i am sure miss woodhouse will 
allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in my mother 
will be so very happy to see her and now we are such a nice party 
she cannot refuse aye pray do said mr frank churchill 
miss woodhouse s opinion of the instrument will be worth having 
but said i i shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go 
with me oh said he wait half a minute till i have finished 
my job for would you believe it miss woodhouse there he is 
in the most obliging manner in the world fastening in the rivet of my 
mother s spectacles the rivet came out you know this morning 
so very obliging for my mother had no use of her spectacles 
could not put them on and by the bye every body ought to have 
two pair of spectacles they should indeed jane said so 
i meant to take them over to john saunders the first thing i did 
but something or other hindered me all the morning first one thing 
then another there is no saying what you know at one time patty came 
to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping oh said i 
patty do not come with your bad news to me here is the rivet 
of your mistress s spectacles out then the baked apples came home 
mrs wallis sent them by her boy they are extremely civil and 
obliging to us the wallises always i have heard some people 
say that mrs wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer 
but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention 
from them and it cannot be for the value of our custom now 
for what is our consumption of bread you know only three of us 
besides dear jane at present and she really eats nothing makes such 
a shocking breakfast you would be quite frightened if you saw it 
i dare not let my mother know how little she eats so i say one 
thing and then i say another and it passes off but about the 
middle of the day she gets hungry and there is nothing she likes 
so well as these baked apples and they are extremely wholesome 
for i took the opportunity the other day of asking mr perry 
i happened to meet him in the street not that i had any doubt before 
i have so often heard mr woodhouse recommend a baked apple 
i believe it is the only way that mr woodhouse thinks the 
fruit thoroughly wholesome we have apple dumplings however 
very often patty makes an excellent apple dumpling well 
mrs weston you have prevailed i hope and these ladies will 
oblige us 
emma would be very happy to wait on mrs bates c and they 
did at last move out of the shop with no farther delay from miss 
bates than 
how do you do mrs ford i beg your pardon i did not see 
you before i hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons 
from town jane came back delighted yesterday thank ye 
the gloves do very well only a little too large about the wrist 
but jane is taking them in 
what was i talking of said she beginning again when they were 
all in the street 
emma wondered on what of all the medley she would fix 
i declare i cannot recollect what i was talking of oh my 
mother s spectacles so very obliging of mr frank churchill 
oh said he i do think i can fasten the rivet i like a job 
of this kind excessively which you know shewed him to be so 
very indeed i must say that much as i had heard of him 
before and much as i had expected he very far exceeds any 
thing i do congratulate you mrs weston most warmly 
he seems every thing the fondest parent could oh said he 
i can fasten the rivet i like a job of that sort excessively 
i never shall forget his manner and when i brought out the baked 
apples from the closet and hoped our friends would be so very 
obliging as to take some oh said he directly there is nothing 
in the way of fruit half so good and these are the finest looking 
home baked apples i ever saw in my life that you know was so 
very and i am sure by his manner it was no compliment 
indeed they are very delightful apples and mrs wallis does them 
full justice only we do not have them baked more than twice 
and mr woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times 
but miss woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it the apples 
themselves are the very finest sort for baking beyond a doubt 
all from donwell some of mr knightley s most liberal supply 
he sends us a sack every year and certainly there never was such 
a keeping apple anywhere as one of his trees i believe there 
is two of them my mother says the orchard was always famous 
in her younger days but i was really quite shocked the other day 
for mr knightley called one morning and jane was eating these apples 
and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them 
and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock 
i am sure you must be said he and i will send you 
another supply for i have a great many more than i can ever use 
william larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year 
i will send you some more before they get good for nothing 
so i begged he would not for really as to ours being gone i could 
not absolutely say that we had a great many left it was but half 
a dozen indeed but they should be all kept for jane and i could 
not at all bear that he should be sending us more so liberal as he 
had been already and jane said the same and when he was gone 
she almost quarrelled with me no i should not say quarrelled 
for we never had a quarrel in our lives but she was quite distressed 
that i had owned the apples were so nearly gone she wished i had 
made him believe we had a great many left oh said i my dear 
i did say as much as i could however the very same evening 
william larkins came over with a large basket of apples the same 
sort of apples a bushel at least and i was very much obliged 
and went down and spoke to william larkins and said every thing 
as you may suppose william larkins is such an old acquaintance 
i am always glad to see him but however i found afterwards 
from patty that william said it was all the apples of that sort 
his master had he had brought them all and now his master had not 
one left to bake or boil william did not seem to mind it himself 
he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many for william 
you know thinks more of his master s profit than any thing 
but mrs hodges he said was quite displeased at their being 
all sent away she could not bear that her master should not be 
able to have another apple tart this spring he told patty this 
but bid her not mind it and be sure not to say any thing to us 
about it for mrs hodges would be cross sometimes and as long as 
so many sacks were sold it did not signify who ate the remainder 
and so patty told me and i was excessively shocked indeed 
i would not have mr knightley know any thing about it for 
the world he would be so very i wanted to keep it from 
jane s knowledge but unluckily i had mentioned it before i was 
aware 
miss bates had just done as patty opened the door and her visitors 
walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to 
pursued only by the sounds of her desultory good will 
pray take care mrs weston there is a step at the turning 
pray take care miss woodhouse ours is rather a dark staircase 
rather darker and narrower than one could wish miss smith 
pray take care miss woodhouse i am quite concerned i am sure you 
hit your foot miss smith the step at the turning 
chapter x 
the appearance of the little sitting room as they entered 
was tranquillity itself mrs bates deprived of her usual employment 
slumbering on one side of the fire frank churchill at a table 
near her most deedily occupied about her spectacles and jane fairfax 
standing with her back to them intent on her pianoforte 
busy as he was however the young man was yet able to shew a most 
happy countenance on seeing emma again 
this is a pleasure said he in rather a low voice coming at 
least ten minutes earlier than i had calculated you find me 
trying to be useful tell me if you think i shall succeed 
what said mrs weston have not you finished it yet you would 
not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate 
i have not been working uninterruptedly he replied i have been 
assisting miss fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily 
it was not quite firm an unevenness in the floor i believe 
you see we have been wedging one leg with paper this was very kind 
of you to be persuaded to come i was almost afraid you would be 
hurrying home 
he contrived that she should be seated by him and was sufficiently 
employed in looking out the best baked apple for her and trying 
to make her help or advise him in his work till jane fairfax was 
quite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again that she was not 
immediately ready emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves 
she had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it 
without emotion she must reason herself into the power of performance 
and emma could not but pity such feelings whatever their origin 
and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again 
at last jane began and though the first bars were feebly given 
the powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to 
mrs weston had been delighted before and was delighted again 
emma joined her in all her praise and the pianoforte with every 
proper discrimination was pronounced to be altogether of the 
highest promise 
whoever colonel campbell might employ said frank churchill 
with a smile at emma the person has not chosen ill i heard a good 
deal of colonel campbell s taste at weymouth and the softness of the 
upper notes i am sure is exactly what he and all that party would 
particularly prize i dare say miss fairfax that he either gave 
his friend very minute directions or wrote to broadwood himself 
do not you think so 
jane did not look round she was not obliged to hear mrs weston 
had been speaking to her at the same moment 
it is not fair said emma in a whisper mine was a random guess 
do not distress her 
he shook his head with a smile and looked as if he had very little 
doubt and very little mercy soon afterwards he began again 
how much your friends in ireland must be enjoying your pleasure 
on this occasion miss fairfax i dare say they often think of you 
and wonder which will be the day the precise day of the instrument s 
coming to hand do you imagine colonel campbell knows the business 
to be going forward just at this time do you imagine it to be 
the consequence of an immediate commission from him or that he may 
have sent only a general direction an order indefinite as to time 
to depend upon contingencies and conveniences 
he paused she could not but hear she could not avoid answering 
till i have a letter from colonel campbell said she in a voice 
of forced calmness i can imagine nothing with any confidence 
it must be all conjecture 
conjecture aye sometimes one conjectures right and sometimes 
one conjectures wrong i wish i could conjecture how soon i shall 
make this rivet quite firm what nonsense one talks miss woodhouse 
when hard at work if one talks at all your real workmen 
i suppose hold their tongues but we gentlemen labourers if we get 
hold of a word miss fairfax said something about conjecturing 
there it is done i have the pleasure madam to mrs bates 
of restoring your spectacles healed for the present 
he was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter to escape 
a little from the latter he went to the pianoforte and begged 
miss fairfax who was still sitting at it to play something more 
if you are very kind said he it will be one of the waltzes 
we danced last night let me live them over again you did not 
enjoy them as i did you appeared tired the whole time i believe 
you were glad we danced no longer but i would have given worlds 
all the worlds one ever has to give for another half hour 
she played 
what felicity it is to hear a tune again which has made one happy 
if i mistake not that was danced at weymouth 
she looked up at him for a moment coloured deeply and played 
something else he took some music from a chair near the pianoforte 
and turning to emma said 
here is something quite new to me do you know it cramer 
and here are a new set of irish melodies that from such a quarter 
one might expect this was all sent with the instrument very thoughtful 
of colonel campbell was not it he knew miss fairfax could have 
no music here i honour that part of the attention particularly 
it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart nothing hastily 
done nothing incomplete true affection only could have prompted it 
emma wished he would be less pointed yet could not help being amused 
and when on glancing her eye towards jane fairfax she caught 
the remains of a smile when she saw that with all the deep blush 
of consciousness there had been a smile of secret delight 
she had less scruple in the amusement and much less compunction 
with respect to her this amiable upright perfect jane fairfax 
was apparently cherishing very reprehensible feelings 
he brought all the music to her and they looked it over together 
emma took the opportunity of whispering 
you speak too plain she must understand you 
i hope she does i would have her understand me i am not 
in the least ashamed of my meaning 
but really i am half ashamed and wish i had never taken up 
the idea 
i am very glad you did and that you communicated it to me 
i have now a key to all her odd looks and ways leave shame to her 
if she does wrong she ought to feel it 
she is not entirely without it i think 
i do not see much sign of it she is playing robin adair 
at this moment his favourite 
shortly afterwards miss bates passing near the window 
descried mr knightley on horse back not far off 
mr knightley i declare i must speak to him if possible 
just to thank him i will not open the window here it would give 
you all cold but i can go into my mother s room you know i dare 
say he will come in when he knows who is here quite delightful 
to have you all meet so our little room so honoured 
she was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke and opening 
the casement there immediately called mr knightley s attention 
and every syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard 
by the others as if it had passed within the same apartment 
how d ye do how d ye do very well i thank you so obliged 
to you for the carriage last night we were just in time 
my mother just ready for us pray come in do come in you will 
find some friends here 
so began miss bates and mr knightley seemed determined to be heard 
in his turn for most resolutely and commandingly did he say 
how is your niece miss bates i want to inquire after you all 
but particularly your niece how is miss fairfax i hope she 
caught no cold last night how is she to day tell me how miss 
fairfax is 
and miss bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he 
would hear her in any thing else the listeners were amused 
and mrs weston gave emma a look of particular meaning but emma 
still shook her head in steady scepticism 
so obliged to you so very much obliged to you for the carriage 
resumed miss bates 
he cut her short with 
i am going to kingston can i do any thing for you 
oh dear kingston are you mrs cole was saying the other day 
she wanted something from kingston 
mrs cole has servants to send can i do any thing for you 
no i thank you but do come in who do you think is here 
miss woodhouse and miss smith so kind as to call to hear the 
new pianoforte do put up your horse at the crown and come in 
well said he in a deliberating manner for five minutes perhaps 
and here is mrs weston and mr frank churchill too quite delightful 
so many friends 
no not now i thank you i could not stay two minutes 
i must get on to kingston as fast as i can 
oh do come in they will be so very happy to see you 
no no your room is full enough i will call another day 
and hear the pianoforte 
well i am so sorry oh mr knightley what a delightful party 
last night how extremely pleasant did you ever see such dancing 
was not it delightful miss woodhouse and mr frank churchill 
i never saw any thing equal to it 
oh very delightful indeed i can say nothing less for i suppose 
miss woodhouse and mr frank churchill are hearing every thing 
that passes and raising his voice still more i do not see why miss 
fairfax should not be mentioned too i think miss fairfax dances 
very well and mrs weston is the very best country dance player 
without exception in england now if your friends have any gratitude 
they will say something pretty loud about you and me in return 
but i cannot stay to hear it 
oh mr knightley one moment more something of consequence 
so shocked jane and i are both so shocked about the apples 
what is the matter now 
to think of your sending us all your store apples you said you had 
a great many and now you have not one left we really are so shocked 
mrs hodges may well be angry william larkins mentioned it here 
you should not have done it indeed you should not ah he is off 
he never can bear to be thanked but i thought he would have staid now 
and it would have been a pity not to have mentioned well 
returning to the room i have not been able to succeed 
mr knightley cannot stop he is going to kingston he asked me 
if he could do any thing 
yes said jane we heard his kind offers we heard every thing 
oh yes my dear i dare say you might because you know the door 
was open and the window was open and mr knightley spoke loud 
you must have heard every thing to be sure can i do any thing 
for you at kingston said he so i just mentioned oh 
miss woodhouse must you be going you seem but just come so very 
obliging of you 
emma found it really time to be at home the visit had already 
lasted long and on examining watches so much of the morning was 
perceived to be gone that mrs weston and her companion taking 
leave also could allow themselves only to walk with the two young 
ladies to hartfield gates before they set off for randalls 
chapter xi 
it may be possible to do without dancing entirely instances have 
been known of young people passing many many months successively 
without being at any ball of any description and no material injury 
accrue either to body or mind but when a beginning is made 
when the felicities of rapid motion have once been though slightly 
felt it must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more 
frank churchill had danced once at highbury and longed to dance again 
and the last half hour of an evening which mr woodhouse was persuaded 
to spend with his daughter at randalls was passed by the two young 
people in schemes on the subject frank s was the first idea 
and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it for the lady was the best 
judge of the difficulties and the most solicitous for accommodation 
and appearance but still she had inclination enough for shewing 
people again how delightfully mr frank churchill and miss 
woodhouse danced for doing that in which she need not blush to compare 
herself with jane fairfax and even for simple dancing itself 
without any of the wicked aids of vanity to assist him first 
in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made 
to hold and then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour 
in the hope of discovering in spite of all that mr weston could 
say of their exactly equal size that it was a little the largest 
his first proposition and request that the dance begun at mr cole s 
should be finished there that the same party should be collected 
and the same musician engaged met with the readiest acquiescence 
mr weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment 
and mrs weston most willingly undertook to play as long as they 
could wish to dance and the interesting employment had followed 
of reckoning up exactly who there would be and portioning out the 
indispensable division of space to every couple 
you and miss smith and miss fairfax will be three and the two 
miss coxes five had been repeated many times over and there 
will be the two gilberts young cox my father and myself 
besides mr knightley yes that will be quite enough for pleasure 
you and miss smith and miss fairfax will be three and the two miss 
coxes five and for five couple there will be plenty of room 
but soon it came to be on one side 
but will there be good room for five couple i really do not think 
there will 
on another 
and after all five couple are not enough to make it worth 
while to stand up five couple are nothing when one thinks 
seriously about it it will not do to invite five couple 
it can be allowable only as the thought of the moment 
somebody said that miss gilbert was expected at her brother s 
and must be invited with the rest somebody else believed 
mrs gilbert would have danced the other evening if she had 
been asked a word was put in for a second young cox and at last 
mr weston naming one family of cousins who must be included 
and another of very old acquaintance who could not be left out 
it became a certainty that the five couple would be at least ten 
and a very interesting speculation in what possible manner they 
could be disposed of 
the doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other 
might not they use both rooms and dance across the passage 
it seemed the best scheme and yet it was not so good but that 
many of them wanted a better emma said it would be awkward 
mrs weston was in distress about the supper and mr woodhouse 
opposed it earnestly on the score of health it made him so 
very unhappy indeed that it could not be persevered in 
oh no said he it would be the extreme of imprudence 
i could not bear it for emma emma is not strong she would 
catch a dreadful cold so would poor little harriet 
so you would all mrs weston you would be quite laid up 
do not let them talk of such a wild thing pray do not let them 
talk of it that young man speaking lower is very thoughtless 
do not tell his father but that young man is not quite the thing 
he has been opening the doors very often this evening and keeping 
them open very inconsiderately he does not think of the draught 
i do not mean to set you against him but indeed he is not quite 
the thing 
mrs weston was sorry for such a charge she knew the importance 
of it and said every thing in her power to do it away every door 
was now closed the passage plan given up and the first scheme 
of dancing only in the room they were in resorted to again 
and with such good will on frank churchill s part that the space 
which a quarter of an hour before had been deemed barely sufficient 
for five couple was now endeavoured to be made out quite enough 
for ten 
we were too magnificent said he we allowed unnecessary room 
ten couple may stand here very well 
emma demurred it would be a crowd a sad crowd and what could 
be worse than dancing without space to turn in 
very true he gravely replied it was very bad but still he 
went on measuring and still he ended with 
i think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple 
no no said she you are quite unreasonable it would be dreadful 
to be standing so close nothing can be farther from pleasure 
than to be dancing in a crowd and a crowd in a little room 
there is no denying it he replied i agree with you exactly 
a crowd in a little room miss woodhouse you have the art of giving 
pictures in a few words exquisite quite exquisite still however 
having proceeded so far one is unwilling to give the matter up 
it would be a disappointment to my father and altogether i do 
not know that i am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand 
here very well 
emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little 
self willed and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure 
of dancing with her but she took the compliment and forgave 
the rest had she intended ever to marry him it might have been 
worth while to pause and consider and try to understand the value 
of his preference and the character of his temper but for 
all the purposes of their acquaintance he was quite amiable enough 
before the middle of the next day he was at hartfield and he entered 
the room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance 
of the scheme it soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement 
well miss woodhouse he almost immediately began your inclination 
for dancing has not been quite frightened away i hope by the 
terrors of my father s little rooms i bring a new proposal 
on the subject a thought of my father s which waits only your 
approbation to be acted upon may i hope for the honour of your 
hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball 
to be given not at randalls but at the crown inn 
the crown 
yes if you and mr woodhouse see no objection and i trust you cannot 
my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there 
better accommodations he can promise them and not a less grateful 
welcome than at randalls it is his own idea mrs weston sees 
no objection to it provided you are satisfied this is what we 
all feel oh you were perfectly right ten couple in either of 
the randalls rooms would have been insufferable dreadful i felt 
how right you were the whole time but was too anxious for securing 
any thing to like to yield is not it a good exchange you consent 
i hope you consent 
it appears to me a plan that nobody can object to if mr and 
mrs weston do not i think it admirable and as far as i can 
answer for myself shall be most happy it seems the only improvement 
that could be papa do you not think it an excellent improvement 
she was obliged to repeat and explain it before it was fully 
comprehended and then being quite new farther representations 
were necessary to make it acceptable 
no he thought it very far from an improvement a very bad plan 
much worse than the other a room at an inn was always damp 
and dangerous never properly aired or fit to be inhabited 
if they must dance they had better dance at randalls he had never 
been in the room at the crown in his life did not know the people 
who kept it by sight oh no a very bad plan they would catch 
worse colds at the crown than anywhere 
i was going to observe sir said frank churchill 
that one of the great recommendations of this change would 
be the very little danger of any body s catching cold 
so much less danger at the crown than at randalls mr perry 
might have reason to regret the alteration but nobody else could 
sir said mr woodhouse rather warmly you are very much 
mistaken if you suppose mr perry to be that sort of character 
mr perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill but i 
do not understand how the room at the crown can be safer for you 
than your father s house 
from the very circumstance of its being larger sir we shall have 
no occasion to open the windows at all not once the whole evening 
and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows letting in cold 
air upon heated bodies which as you well know sir does the mischief 
open the windows but surely mr churchill nobody would think 
of opening the windows at randalls nobody could be so imprudent 
i never heard of such a thing dancing with open windows i am sure 
neither your father nor mrs weston poor miss taylor that was 
would suffer it 
ah sir but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind 
a window curtain and throw up a sash without its being suspected 
i have often known it done myself 
have you indeed sir bless me i never could have supposed it 
but i live out of the world and am often astonished at what i hear 
however this does make a difference and perhaps when we come 
to talk it over but these sort of things require a good deal 
of consideration one cannot resolve upon them in a hurry 
if mr and mrs weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning 
we may talk it over and see what can be done 
but unfortunately sir my time is so limited 
oh interrupted emma there will be plenty of time for talking 
every thing over there is no hurry at all if it can be contrived 
to be at the crown papa it will be very convenient for the horses 
they will be so near their own stable 
so they will my dear that is a great thing not that james 
ever complains but it is right to spare our horses when we can 
if i could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired but is 
mrs stokes to be trusted i doubt it i do not know her 
even by sight 
i can answer for every thing of that nature sir because it will 
be under mrs weston s care mrs weston undertakes to direct 
the whole 
there papa now you must be satisfied our own dear mrs weston 
who is carefulness itself do not you remember what mr perry said 
so many years ago when i had the measles if miss taylor undertakes 
to wrap miss emma up you need not have any fears sir how often 
have i heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her 
aye very true mr perry did say so i shall never forget it 
poor little emma you were very bad with the measles that is 
you would have been very bad but for perry s great attention 
he came four times a day for a week he said from the first 
it was a very good sort which was our great comfort but the measles 
are a dreadful complaint i hope whenever poor isabella s little ones 
have the measles she will send for perry 
my father and mrs weston are at the crown at this moment 
said frank churchill examining the capabilities of the house 
i left them there and came on to hartfield impatient for your opinion 
and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice 
on the spot i was desired to say so from both it would be the 
greatest pleasure to them if you could allow me to attend you there 
they can do nothing satisfactorily without you 
emma was most happy to be called to such a council and her father 
engaging to think it all over while she was gone the two young 
people set off together without delay for the crown there were 
mr and mrs weston delighted to see her and receive her approbation 
very busy and very happy in their different way she in some 
little distress and he finding every thing perfect 
emma said she this paper is worse than i expected 
look in places you see it is dreadfully dirty and the wainscot 
is more yellow and forlorn than any thing i could have imagined 
my dear you are too particular said her husband what does 
all that signify you will see nothing of it by candlelight 
it will be as clean as randalls by candlelight we never see any 
thing of it on our club nights 
the ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant men never 
know when things are dirty or not and the gentlemen perhaps 
thought each to himself women will have their little nonsenses 
and needless cares 
one perplexity however arose which the gentlemen did not disdain 
it regarded a supper room at the time of the ballroom s being built 
suppers had not been in question and a small card room adjoining 
was the only addition what was to be done this card room would 
be wanted as a card room now or if cards were conveniently voted 
unnecessary by their four selves still was it not too small for 
any comfortable supper another room of much better size might be 
secured for the purpose but it was at the other end of the house 
and a long awkward passage must be gone through to get at it 
this made a difficulty mrs weston was afraid of draughts 
for the young people in that passage and neither emma nor the 
gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded 
at supper 
mrs weston proposed having no regular supper merely sandwiches 
c set out in the little room but that was scouted as a 
wretched suggestion a private dance without sitting down to supper 
was pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women 
and mrs weston must not speak of it again she then took another 
line of expediency and looking into the doubtful room observed 
i do not think it is so very small we shall not be many 
you know 
and mr weston at the same time walking briskly with long steps 
through the passage was calling out 
you talk a great deal of the length of this passage my dear 
it is a mere nothing after all and not the least draught from 
the stairs 
i wish said mrs weston one could know which arrangement our 
guests in general would like best to do what would be most generally 
pleasing must be our object if one could but tell what that would be 
yes very true cried frank very true you want your neighbours 
opinions i do not wonder at you if one could ascertain what the 
chief of them the coles for instance they are not far off 
shall i call upon them or miss bates she is still nearer 
and i do not know whether miss bates is not as likely to understand 
the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body i think 
we do want a larger council suppose i go and invite miss bates 
to join us 
well if you please said mrs weston rather hesitating if you 
think she will be of any use 
you will get nothing to the purpose from miss bates said emma 
she will be all delight and gratitude but she will tell you nothing 
she will not even listen to your questions i see no advantage in 
consulting miss bates 
but she is so amusing so extremely amusing i am very fond 
of hearing miss bates talk and i need not bring the whole family 
you know 
here mr weston joined them and on hearing what was proposed 
gave it his decided approbation 
aye do frank go and fetch miss bates and let us end the matter 
at once she will enjoy the scheme i am sure and i do not know 
a properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties 
fetch miss bates we are growing a little too nice she is 
a standing lesson of how to be happy but fetch them both 
invite them both 
both sir can the old lady 
the old lady no the young lady to be sure i shall think you 
a great blockhead frank if you bring the aunt without the niece 
oh i beg your pardon sir i did not immediately recollect 
undoubtedly if you wish it i will endeavour to persuade them both 
and away he ran 
long before he reappeared attending the short neat brisk moving aunt 
and her elegant niece mrs weston like a sweet tempered 
woman and a good wife had examined the passage again 
and found the evils of it much less than she had supposed before 
indeed very trifling and here ended the difficulties of decision 
all the rest in speculation at least was perfectly smooth 
all the minor arrangements of table and chair lights and music 
tea and supper made themselves or were left as mere trifles 
to be settled at any time between mrs weston and mrs stokes 
every body invited was certainly to come frank had already written 
to enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight 
which could not possibly be refused and a delightful dance it was 
to be 
most cordially when miss bates arrived did she agree that it must 
as a counsellor she was not wanted but as an approver a much 
safer character she was truly welcome her approbation at once 
general and minute warm and incessant could not but please 
and for another half hour they were all walking to and fro 
between the different rooms some suggesting some attending 
and all in happy enjoyment of the future the party did not break 
up without emma s being positively secured for the two first dances 
by the hero of the evening nor without her overhearing mr weston 
whisper to his wife he has asked her my dear that is right 
i knew he would 
chapter xii 
one thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball 
completely satisfactory to emma its being fixed for a day within 
the granted term of frank churchill s stay in surry for in spite 
of mr weston s confidence she could not think it so very impossible 
that the churchills might not allow their nephew to remain 
a day beyond his fortnight but this was not judged feasible 
the preparations must take their time nothing could be properly 
ready till the third week were entered on and for a few days they 
must be planning proceeding and hoping in uncertainty at the risk 
in her opinion the great risk of its being all in vain 
enscombe however was gracious gracious in fact if not in word 
his wish of staying longer evidently did not please but it was 
not opposed all was safe and prosperous and as the removal of one 
solicitude generally makes way for another emma being now certain 
of her ball began to adopt as the next vexation mr knightley s 
provoking indifference about it either because he did not 
dance himself or because the plan had been formed without his 
being consulted he seemed resolved that it should not interest him 
determined against its exciting any present curiosity or affording 
him any future amusement to her voluntary communications emma 
could get no more approving reply than 
very well if the westons think it worth while to be at all this 
trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment i have nothing 
to say against it but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me 
oh yes i must be there i could not refuse and i will keep 
as much awake as i can but i would rather be at home looking over 
william larkins s week s account much rather i confess 
pleasure in seeing dancing not i indeed i never look at it 
i do not know who does fine dancing i believe like virtue 
must be its own reward those who are standing by are usually 
thinking of something very different 
this emma felt was aimed at her and it made her quite angry 
it was not in compliment to jane fairfax however that he was 
so indifferent or so indignant he was not guided by her feelings 
in reprobating the ball for she enjoyed the thought of it 
to an extraordinary degree it made her animated open hearted 
she voluntarily said 
oh miss woodhouse i hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball 
what a disappointment it would be i do look forward to it i own 
with very great pleasure 
it was not to oblige jane fairfax therefore that he would have 
preferred the society of william larkins no she was more and more 
convinced that mrs weston was quite mistaken in that surmise 
there was a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment 
on his side but no love 
alas there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with mr knightley 
two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the 
over throw of every thing a letter arrived from mr churchill 
to urge his nephew s instant return mrs churchill was unwell 
far too unwell to do without him she had been in a very suffering 
state so said her husband when writing to her nephew two days before 
though from her usual unwillingness to give pain and constant 
habit of never thinking of herself she had not mentioned it 
but now she was too ill to trifle and must entreat him to set off 
for enscombe without delay 
the substance of this letter was forwarded to emma in a note 
from mrs weston instantly as to his going it was inevitable 
he must be gone within a few hours though without feeling any real 
alarm for his aunt to lessen his repugnance he knew her illnesses 
they never occurred but for her own convenience 
mrs weston added that he could only allow himself time to 
hurry to highbury after breakfast and take leave of the few 
friends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him 
and that he might be expected at hartfield very soon 
this wretched note was the finale of emma s breakfast when once 
it had been read there was no doing any thing but lament 
and exclaim the loss of the ball the loss of the young man 
and all that the young man might be feeling it was too wretched 
such a delightful evening as it would have been every body so happy 
and she and her partner the happiest i said it would be so 
was the only consolation 
her father s feelings were quite distinct he thought principally 
of mrs churchill s illness and wanted to know how she was treated 
and as for the ball it was shocking to have dear emma disappointed 
but they would all be safer at home 
emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared 
but if this reflected at all upon his impatience his sorrowful 
look and total want of spirits when he did come might redeem him 
he felt the going away almost too much to speak of it his dejection 
was most evident he sat really lost in thought for the first 
few minutes and when rousing himself it was only to say 
of all horrid things leave taking is the worst 
but you will come again said emma this will not be your only 
visit to randalls 
ah shaking his head the uncertainty of when i may be able 
to return i shall try for it with a zeal it will be the object 
of all my thoughts and cares and if my uncle and aunt go to town 
this spring but i am afraid they did not stir last spring 
i am afraid it is a custom gone for ever 
our poor ball must be quite given up 
ah that ball why did we wait for any thing why not seize the 
pleasure at once how often is happiness destroyed by preparation 
foolish preparation you told us it would be so oh miss woodhouse 
why are you always so right 
indeed i am very sorry to be right in this instance i would 
much rather have been merry than wise 
if i can come again we are still to have our ball my father 
depends on it do not forget your engagement 
emma looked graciously 
such a fortnight as it has been he continued every day more 
precious and more delightful than the day before every day making 
me less fit to bear any other place happy those who can remain 
at highbury 
as you do us such ample justice now said emma laughing i will 
venture to ask whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first 
do not we rather surpass your expectations i am sure we do 
i am sure you did not much expect to like us you would not have been 
so long in coming if you had had a pleasant idea of highbury 
he laughed rather consciously and though denying the sentiment 
emma was convinced that it had been so 
and you must be off this very morning 
yes my father is to join me here we shall walk back together 
and i must be off immediately i am almost afraid that every moment 
will bring him 
not five minutes to spare even for your friends miss fairfax and 
miss bates how unlucky miss bates s powerful argumentative mind 
might have strengthened yours 
yes i have called there passing the door i thought it better 
it was a right thing to do i went in for three minutes and was 
detained by miss bates s being absent she was out and i felt it 
impossible not to wait till she came in she is a woman that one may 
that one must laugh at but that one would not wish to slight 
it was better to pay my visit then 
he hesitated got up walked to a window 
in short said he perhaps miss woodhouse i think you can 
hardly be quite without suspicion 
he looked at her as if wanting to read her thoughts she hardly 
knew what to say it seemed like the forerunner of something 
absolutely serious which she did not wish forcing herself 
to speak therefore in the hope of putting it by she calmly said 
you are quite in the right it was most natural to pay your visit then 
he was silent she believed he was looking at her probably reflecting 
on what she had said and trying to understand the manner 
she heard him sigh it was natural for him to feel that he had 
cause to sigh he could not believe her to be encouraging him 
a few awkward moments passed and he sat down again and in a more 
determined manner said 
it was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be 
given to hartfield my regard for hartfield is most warm 
he stopt again rose again and seemed quite embarrassed 
he was more in love with her than emma had supposed and who can say 
how it might have ended if his father had not made his appearance 
mr woodhouse soon followed and the necessity of exertion made 
him composed 
a very few minutes more however completed the present trial 
mr weston always alert when business was to be done and as 
incapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable 
as of foreseeing any that was doubtful said it was time to go 
and the young man though he might and did sigh could not but agree 
to take leave 
i shall hear about you all said he that is my chief consolation 
i shall hear of every thing that is going on among you i have 
engaged mrs weston to correspond with me she has been so kind as 
to promise it oh the blessing of a female correspondent when one 
is really interested in the absent she will tell me every thing 
in her letters i shall be at dear highbury again 
a very friendly shake of the hand a very earnest good bye 
closed the speech and the door had soon shut out frank churchill 
short had been the notice short their meeting he was gone and emma 
felt so sorry to part and foresaw so great a loss to their little 
society from his absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry 
and feeling it too much 
it was a sad change they had been meeting almost every day 
since his arrival certainly his being at randalls had given 
great spirit to the last two weeks indescribable spirit the idea 
the expectation of seeing him which every morning had brought 
the assurance of his attentions his liveliness his manners 
it had been a very happy fortnight and forlorn must be the sinking 
from it into the common course of hartfield days to complete every 
other recommendation he had almost told her that he loved her 
what strength or what constancy of affection he might be subject to 
was another point but at present she could not doubt his having 
a decidedly warm admiration a conscious preference of herself 
and this persuasion joined to all the rest made her think that 
she must be a little in love with him in spite of every previous 
determination against it 
i certainly must said she this sensation of listlessness 
weariness stupidity this disinclination to sit down and employ myself 
this feeling of every thing s being dull and insipid about the house 
i must be in love i should be the oddest creature in the world if i 
were not for a few weeks at least well evil to some is always 
good to others i shall have many fellow mourners for the ball 
if not for frank churchill but mr knightley will be happy 
he may spend the evening with his dear william larkins now if he likes 
mr knightley however shewed no triumphant happiness he could 
not say that he was sorry on his own account his very cheerful look 
would have contradicted him if he had but he said and very steadily 
that he was sorry for the disappointment of the others and with 
considerable kindness added 
you emma who have so few opportunities of dancing you are really 
out of luck you are very much out of luck 
it was some days before she saw jane fairfax to judge of her 
honest regret in this woeful change but when they did meet 
her composure was odious she had been particularly unwell however 
suffering from headache to a degree which made her aunt declare 
that had the ball taken place she did not think jane could have 
attended it and it was charity to impute some of her unbecoming 
indifference to the languor of ill health 
chapter xiii 
emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love her ideas 
only varied as to the how much at first she thought it was a good deal 
and afterwards but little she had great pleasure in hearing frank 
churchill talked of and for his sake greater pleasure than ever 
in seeing mr and mrs weston she was very often thinking of him 
and quite impatient for a letter that she might know how he was 
how were his spirits how was his aunt and what was the chance 
of his coming to randalls again this spring but on the other hand 
she could not admit herself to be unhappy nor after the 
first morning to be less disposed for employment than usual 
she was still busy and cheerful and pleasing as he was she could 
yet imagine him to have faults and farther though thinking of him 
so much and as she sat drawing or working forming a thousand 
amusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment 
fancying interesting dialogues and inventing elegant letters 
the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his side was that she 
refused him their affection was always to subside into friendship 
every thing tender and charming was to mark their parting 
but still they were to part when she became sensible of this 
it struck her that she could not be very much in love for in spite 
of her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father 
never to marry a strong attachment certainly must produce more 
of a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings 
i do not find myself making any use of the word sacrifice said she 
in not one of all my clever replies my delicate negatives 
is there any allusion to making a sacrifice i do suspect that he 
is not really necessary to my happiness so much the better 
i certainly will not persuade myself to feel more than i do i am 
quite enough in love i should be sorry to be more 
upon the whole she was equally contented with her view of his feelings 
he is undoubtedly very much in love every thing denotes it very much 
in love indeed and when he comes again if his affection continue 
i must be on my guard not to encourage it it would be most 
inexcusable to do otherwise as my own mind is quite made up 
not that i imagine he can think i have been encouraging him hitherto 
no if he had believed me at all to share his feelings he would 
not have been so wretched could he have thought himself encouraged 
his looks and language at parting would have been different 
still however i must be on my guard this is in the supposition 
of his attachment continuing what it now is but i do not know that i 
expect it will i do not look upon him to be quite the sort of man 
i do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy 
his feelings are warm but i can imagine them rather changeable 
every consideration of the subject in short makes me thankful 
that my happiness is not more deeply involved i shall do very well 
again after a little while and then it will be a good thing over 
for they say every body is in love once in their lives and i shall 
have been let off easily 
when his letter to mrs weston arrived emma had the perusal of it 
and she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made 
her at first shake her head over her own sensations and think she 
had undervalued their strength it was a long well written letter 
giving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings 
expressing all the affection gratitude and respect which was 
natural and honourable and describing every thing exterior and local 
that could be supposed attractive with spirit and precision 
no suspicious flourishes now of apology or concern it was the 
language of real feeling towards mrs weston and the transition 
from highbury to enscombe the contrast between the places in some 
of the first blessings of social life was just enough touched on 
to shew how keenly it was felt and how much more might have been 
said but for the restraints of propriety the charm of her own 
name was not wanting miss woodhouse appeared more than once 
and never without a something of pleasing connexion either a 
compliment to her taste or a remembrance of what she had said 
and in the very last time of its meeting her eye unadorned as it 
was by any such broad wreath of gallantry she yet could discern 
the effect of her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment 
perhaps of all conveyed compressed into the very lowest vacant 
corner were these words i had not a spare moment on tuesday 
as you know for miss woodhouse s beautiful little friend pray make 
my excuses and adieus to her this emma could not doubt was all 
for herself harriet was remembered only from being her friend 
his information and prospects as to enscombe were neither worse nor 
better than had been anticipated mrs churchill was recovering 
and he dared not yet even in his own imagination fix a time for 
coming to randalls again 
gratifying however and stimulative as was the letter in the 
material part its sentiments she yet found when it was folded up 
and returned to mrs weston that it had not added any lasting warmth 
that she could still do without the writer and that he must learn 
to do without her her intentions were unchanged her resolution 
of refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for 
his subsequent consolation and happiness his recollection of harriet 
and the words which clothed it the beautiful little friend 
suggested to her the idea of harriet s succeeding her in his affections 
was it impossible no harriet undoubtedly was greatly his 
inferior in understanding but he had been very much struck with 
the loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner 
and all the probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in 
her favour for harriet it would be advantageous and delightful indeed 
i must not dwell upon it said she i must not think of it 
i know the danger of indulging such speculations but stranger 
things have happened and when we cease to care for each other 
as we do now it will be the means of confirming us in that sort 
of true disinterested friendship which i can already look forward 
to with pleasure 
it was well to have a comfort in store on harriet s behalf 
though it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom for evil 
in that quarter was at hand as frank churchill s arrival had 
succeeded mr elton s engagement in the conversation of highbury 
as the latest interest had entirely borne down the first so now 
upon frank churchill s disappearance mr elton s concerns were 
assuming the most irresistible form his wedding day was named 
he would soon be among them again mr elton and his bride 
there was hardly time to talk over the first letter from enscombe 
before mr elton and his bride was in every body s mouth 
and frank churchill was forgotten emma grew sick at the sound 
she had had three weeks of happy exemption from mr elton 
and harriet s mind she had been willing to hope had been lately 
gaining strength with mr weston s ball in view at least 
there had been a great deal of insensibility to other things 
but it was now too evident that she had not attained such a state 
of composure as could stand against the actual approach new carriage 
bell ringing and all 
poor harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the 
reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that emma 
could give emma felt that she could not do too much for her 
that harriet had a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience 
but it was heavy work to be for ever convincing without producing 
any effect for ever agreed to without being able to make their opinions 
the same harriet listened submissively and said it was very true 
it was just as miss woodhouse described it was not worth while to 
think about them and she would not think about them any longer 
but no change of subject could avail and the next half hour 
saw her as anxious and restless about the eltons as before 
at last emma attacked her on another ground 
your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about 
mr elton s marrying harriet is the strongest reproach you can 
make me you could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake i 
fell into it was all my doing i know i have not forgotten it 
i assure you deceived myself i did very miserably deceive you 
and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever do not imagine 
me in danger of forgetting it 
harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words 
of eager exclamation emma continued 
i have not said exert yourself harriet for my sake think less 
talk less of mr elton for my sake because for your own sake rather 
i would wish it to be done for the sake of what is more important 
than my comfort a habit of self command in you a consideration 
of what is your duty an attention to propriety an endeavour 
to avoid the suspicions of others to save your health and credit 
and restore your tranquillity these are the motives which i 
have been pressing on you they are very important and sorry 
i am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act upon them 
my being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration i want 
you to save yourself from greater pain perhaps i may sometimes 
have felt that harriet would not forget what was due or rather 
what would be kind by me 
this appeal to her affections did more than all the rest 
the idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for miss woodhouse 
whom she really loved extremely made her wretched for a while 
and when the violence of grief was comforted away still remained 
powerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it 
very tolerably 
you who have been the best friend i ever had in my life 
want gratitude to you nobody is equal to you i care for nobody 
as i do for you oh miss woodhouse how ungrateful i have been 
such expressions assisted as they were by every thing that look 
and manner could do made emma feel that she had never loved harriet 
so well nor valued her affection so highly before 
there is no charm equal to tenderness of heart said she 
afterwards to herself there is nothing to be compared to it 
warmth and tenderness of heart with an affectionate open manner 
will beat all the clearness of head in the world for attraction 
i am sure it will it is tenderness of heart which makes my dear 
father so generally beloved which gives isabella all her popularity 
i have it not but i know how to prize and respect it harriet is 
my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives 
dear harriet i would not change you for the clearest headed 
longest sighted best judging female breathing oh the coldness 
of a jane fairfax harriet is worth a hundred such and for a wife 
a sensible man s wife it is invaluable i mention no names 
but happy the man who changes emma for harriet 
chapter xiv 
mrs elton was first seen at church but though devotion might 
be interrupted curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew 
and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid 
to settle whether she were very pretty indeed or only rather pretty 
or not pretty at all 
emma had feelings less of curiosity than of pride or propriety 
to make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects 
and she made a point of harriet s going with her that the worst of 
the business might be gone through as soon as possible 
she could not enter the house again could not be in the same room 
to which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago 
to lace up her boot without recollecting a thousand vexatious 
thoughts would recur compliments charades and horrible blunders 
and it was not to be supposed that poor harriet should not be 
recollecting too but she behaved very well and was only rather 
pale and silent the visit was of course short and there was so 
much embarrassment and occupation of mind to shorten it that emma 
would not allow herself entirely to form an opinion of the lady 
and on no account to give one beyond the nothing meaning terms 
of being elegantly dressed and very pleasing 
she did not really like her she would not be in a hurry to find fault 
but she suspected that there was no elegance ease but not elegance 
she was almost sure that for a young woman a stranger a bride 
there was too much ease her person was rather good her face 
not unpretty but neither feature nor air nor voice nor manner 
were elegant emma thought at least it would turn out so 
as for mr elton his manners did not appear but no she would 
not permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners 
it was an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits 
and a man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it 
the woman was better off she might have the assistance of fine clothes 
and the privilege of bashfulness but the man had only his own 
good sense to depend on and when she considered how peculiarly 
unlucky poor mr elton was in being in the same room at once with 
the woman he had just married the woman he had wanted to marry 
and the woman whom he had been expected to marry she must allow him 
to have the right to look as little wise and to be as much affectedly 
and as little really easy as could be 
well miss woodhouse said harriet when they had quitted 
the house and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin 
well miss woodhouse with a gentle sigh what do you think of her 
is not she very charming 
there was a little hesitation in emma s answer 
oh yes very a very pleasing young woman 
i think her beautiful quite beautiful 
very nicely dressed indeed a remarkably elegant gown 
i am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love 
oh no there is nothing to surprize one at all a pretty fortune 
and she came in his way 
i dare say returned harriet sighing again i dare say she 
was very much attached to him 
perhaps she might but it is not every man s fate to marry the 
woman who loves him best miss hawkins perhaps wanted a home 
and thought this the best offer she was likely to have 
yes said harriet earnestly and well she might nobody could ever 
have a better well i wish them happy with all my heart and now 
miss woodhouse i do not think i shall mind seeing them again 
he is just as superior as ever but being married you know 
it is quite a different thing no indeed miss woodhouse you need 
not be afraid i can sit and admire him now without any great misery 
to know that he has not thrown himself away is such a comfort 
she does seem a charming young woman just what he deserves 
happy creature he called her augusta how delightful 
when the visit was returned emma made up her mind she could then 
see more and judge better from harriet s happening not to be 
at hartfield and her father s being present to engage mr elton 
she had a quarter of an hour of the lady s conversation to herself 
and could composedly attend to her and the quarter of an hour quite 
convinced her that mrs elton was a vain woman extremely well 
satisfied with herself and thinking much of her own importance 
that she meant to shine and be very superior but with manners which 
had been formed in a bad school pert and familiar that all her 
notions were drawn from one set of people and one style of living 
that if not foolish she was ignorant and that her society would 
certainly do mr elton no good 
harriet would have been a better match if not wise or refined herself 
she would have connected him with those who were but miss hawkins 
it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit had been the best 
of her own set the rich brother in law near bristol was the pride 
of the alliance and his place and his carriages were the pride 
of him 
the very first subject after being seated was maple grove my brother 
mr suckling s seat a comparison of hartfield to maple grove 
the grounds of hartfield were small but neat and pretty and the 
house was modern and well built mrs elton seemed most favourably 
impressed by the size of the room the entrance and all that she 
could see or imagine very like maple grove indeed she was quite 
struck by the likeness that room was the very shape and size 
of the morning room at maple grove her sister s favourite room 
mr elton was appealed to was not it astonishingly like 
she could really almost fancy herself at maple grove 
and the staircase you know as i came in i observed how very like 
the staircase was placed exactly in the same part of the house 
i really could not help exclaiming i assure you miss woodhouse 
it is very delightful to me to be reminded of a place i am so 
extremely partial to as maple grove i have spent so many happy 
months there with a little sigh of sentiment a charming place 
undoubtedly every body who sees it is struck by its beauty 
but to me it has been quite a home whenever you are transplanted 
like me miss woodhouse you will understand how very delightful it 
is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind 
i always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony 
emma made as slight a reply as she could but it was fully sufficient 
for mrs elton who only wanted to be talking herself 
so extremely like maple grove and it is not merely the house 
the grounds i assure you as far as i could observe are strikingly 
like the laurels at maple grove are in the same profusion as here 
and stand very much in the same way just across the lawn 
and i had a glimpse of a fine large tree with a bench round it 
which put me so exactly in mind my brother and sister will be 
enchanted with this place people who have extensive grounds 
themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style 
emma doubted the truth of this sentiment she had a great idea 
that people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little 
for the extensive grounds of any body else but it was not worth 
while to attack an error so double dyed and therefore only said 
in reply 
when you have seen more of this country i am afraid you will think 
you have overrated hartfield surry is full of beauties 
oh yes i am quite aware of that it is the garden of england 
you know surry is the garden of england 
yes but we must not rest our claims on that distinction 
many counties i believe are called the garden of england 
as well as surry 
no i fancy not replied mrs elton with a most satisfied smile 
i never heard any county but surry called so 
emma was silenced 
my brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring 
or summer at farthest continued mrs elton and that will be 
our time for exploring while they are with us we shall explore 
a great deal i dare say they will have their barouche landau 
of course which holds four perfectly and therefore without saying 
any thing of our carriage we should be able to explore the different 
beauties extremely well they would hardly come in their chaise 
i think at that season of the year indeed when the time draws on 
i shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche landau 
it will be so very much preferable when people come into a beautiful 
country of this sort you know miss woodhouse one naturally wishes 
them to see as much as possible and mr suckling is extremely fond 
of exploring we explored to king s weston twice last summer 
in that way most delightfully just after their first having the 
barouche landau you have many parties of that kind here i suppose 
miss woodhouse every summer 
no not immediately here we are rather out of distance of the very 
striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of 
and we are a very quiet set of people i believe more disposed 
to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure 
ah there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort 
nobody can be more devoted to home than i am i was quite 
a proverb for it at maple grove many a time has selina said 
when she has been going to bristol i really cannot get this girl 
to move from the house i absolutely must go in by myself though i 
hate being stuck up in the barouche landau without a companion 
but augusta i believe with her own good will would never stir 
beyond the park paling many a time has she said so and yet i 
am no advocate for entire seclusion i think on the contrary 
when people shut themselves up entirely from society it is a very 
bad thing and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in 
a proper degree without living in it either too much or too little 
i perfectly understand your situation however miss woodhouse 
looking towards mr woodhouse your father s state of health must 
be a great drawback why does not he try bath indeed he should 
let me recommend bath to you i assure you i have no doubt of its doing 
mr woodhouse good 
my father tried it more than once formerly but without receiving 
any benefit and mr perry whose name i dare say is not unknown 
to you does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be 
useful now 
ah that is a great pity for i assure you miss woodhouse 
where the waters do agree it is quite wonderful the relief 
they give in my bath life i have seen such instances of it 
and it is so cheerful a place that it could not fail of being of 
use to mr woodhouse s spirits which i understand are sometimes 
much depressed and as to its recommendations to you i fancy i 
need not take much pains to dwell on them the advantages of bath 
to the young are pretty generally understood it would be a charming 
introduction for you who have lived so secluded a life and i could 
immediately secure you some of the best society in the place 
a line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance and my 
particular friend mrs partridge the lady i have always resided 
with when in bath would be most happy to shew you any attentions 
and would be the very person for you to go into public with 
it was as much as emma could bear without being impolite 
the idea of her being indebted to mrs elton for what was called 
an introduction of her going into public under the auspices 
of a friend of mrs elton s probably some vulgar dashing widow 
who with the help of a boarder just made a shift to live 
the dignity of miss woodhouse of hartfield was sunk indeed 
she restrained herself however from any of the reproofs she could 
have given and only thanked mrs elton coolly but their going 
to bath was quite out of the question and she was not perfectly 
convinced that the place might suit her better than her father 
and then to prevent farther outrage and indignation changed the 
subject directly 
i do not ask whether you are musical mrs elton upon these occasions 
a lady s character generally precedes her and highbury has long 
known that you are a superior performer 
oh no indeed i must protest against any such idea 
a superior performer very far from it i assure you 
consider from how partial a quarter your information came 
i am doatingly fond of music passionately fond and my friends 
say i am not entirely devoid of taste but as to any thing else 
upon my honour my performance is mediocre to the last degree 
you miss woodhouse i well know play delightfully i assure you 
it has been the greatest satisfaction comfort and delight to me 
to hear what a musical society i am got into i absolutely cannot 
do without music it is a necessary of life to me and having always 
been used to a very musical society both at maple grove and in bath 
it would have been a most serious sacrifice i honestly said as much 
to mr e when he was speaking of my future home and expressing 
his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable 
and the inferiority of the house too knowing what i had been 
accustomed to of course he was not wholly without apprehension 
when he was speaking of it in that way i honestly said that the 
world i could give up parties balls plays for i had no fear 
of retirement blessed with so many resources within myself 
the world was not necessary to me i could do very well without it 
to those who had no resources it was a different thing but my 
resources made me quite independent and as to smaller sized rooms 
than i had been used to i really could not give it a thought 
i hoped i was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description 
certainly i had been accustomed to every luxury at maple grove but i 
did assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness 
nor were spacious apartments but said i to be quite honest 
i do not think i can live without something of a musical society 
i condition for nothing else but without music life would be a blank 
to me 
we cannot suppose said emma smiling that mr elton would hesitate 
to assure you of there being a very musical society in highbury 
and i hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than 
may be pardoned in consideration of the motive 
no indeed i have no doubts at all on that head i am delighted 
to find myself in such a circle i hope we shall have many sweet 
little concerts together i think miss woodhouse you and i 
must establish a musical club and have regular weekly meetings 
at your house or ours will not it be a good plan if we 
exert ourselves i think we shall not be long in want of allies 
something of that nature would be particularly desirable for me 
as an inducement to keep me in practice for married women you know 
there is a sad story against them in general they are but too apt 
to give up music 
but you who are so extremely fond of it there can 
be no danger surely 
i should hope not but really when i look around among my acquaintance 
i tremble selina has entirely given up music never touches 
the instrument though she played sweetly and the same may be said 
of mrs jeffereys clara partridge that was and of the two milmans 
now mrs bird and mrs james cooper and of more than i can enumerate 
upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright i used to be 
quite angry with selina but really i begin now to comprehend 
that a married woman has many things to call her attention 
i believe i was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper 
but every thing of that kind said emma will soon 
be in so regular a train 
well said mrs elton laughing we shall see 
emma finding her so determined upon neglecting her music 
had nothing more to say and after a moment s pause mrs elton 
chose another subject 
we have been calling at randalls said she and found them 
both at home and very pleasant people they seem to be 
i like them extremely mr weston seems an excellent creature 
quite a first rate favourite with me already i assure you 
and she appears so truly good there is something so motherly 
and kind hearted about her that it wins upon one directly 
she was your governess i think 
emma was almost too much astonished to answer but mrs elton 
hardly waited for the affirmative before she went on 
having understood as much i was rather astonished to find her 
so very lady like but she is really quite the gentlewoman 
mrs weston s manners said emma were always particularly good 
their propriety simplicity and elegance would make them the safest 
model for any young woman 
and who do you think came in while we were there 
emma was quite at a loss the tone implied some old acquaintance 
and how could she possibly guess 
knightley continued mrs elton knightley himself was not 
it lucky for not being within when he called the other day 
i had never seen him before and of course as so particular a 
friend of mr e s i had a great curiosity my friend knightley 
had been so often mentioned that i was really impatient to see him 
and i must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not 
be ashamed of his friend knightley is quite the gentleman 
i like him very much decidedly i think a very gentleman like man 
happily it was now time to be gone they were off and emma 
could breathe 
insufferable woman was her immediate exclamation worse than i 
had supposed absolutely insufferable knightley i could not 
have believed it knightley never seen him in her life before 
and call him knightley and discover that he is a gentleman 
a little upstart vulgar being with her mr e and her caro sposo 
and her resources and all her airs of pert pretension and 
underbred finery actually to discover that mr knightley is 
a gentleman i doubt whether he will return the compliment 
and discover her to be a lady i could not have believed it 
and to propose that she and i should unite to form a musical club 
one would fancy we were bosom friends and mrs weston 
astonished that the person who had brought me up should be 
a gentlewoman worse and worse i never met with her equal 
much beyond my hopes harriet is disgraced by any comparison 
oh what would frank churchill say to her if he were here 
how angry and how diverted he would be ah there i am 
thinking of him directly always the first person to be thought of 
how i catch myself out frank churchill comes as regularly into 
my mind 
all this ran so glibly through her thoughts that by the time 
her father had arranged himself after the bustle of the eltons 
departure and was ready to speak she was very tolerably capable 
of attending 
well my dear he deliberately began considering we never saw 
her before she seems a very pretty sort of young lady and i dare say 
she was very much pleased with you she speaks a little too quick 
a little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear 
but i believe i am nice i do not like strange voices and nobody speaks 
like you and poor miss taylor however she seems a very obliging 
pretty behaved young lady and no doubt will make him a very good wife 
though i think he had better not have married i made the best 
excuses i could for not having been able to wait on him and mrs elton 
on this happy occasion i said that i hoped i should in the course 
of the summer but i ought to have gone before not to wait upon 
a bride is very remiss ah it shews what a sad invalid i am 
but i do not like the corner into vicarage lane 
i dare say your apologies were accepted sir mr elton knows you 
yes but a young lady a bride i ought to have paid my respects 
to her if possible it was being very deficient 
but my dear papa you are no friend to matrimony and therefore 
why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a bride 
it ought to be no recommendation to you it is encouraging people 
to marry if you make so much of them 
no my dear i never encouraged any body to marry but i would 
always wish to pay every proper attention to a lady and a bride 
especially is never to be neglected more is avowedly due to her 
a bride you know my dear is always the first in company 
let the others be who they may 
well papa if this is not encouragement to marry i do not know 
what is and i should never have expected you to be lending your 
sanction to such vanity baits for poor young ladies 
my dear you do not understand me this is a 
matter of mere common politeness and good breeding 
and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry 
emma had done her father was growing nervous and could not 
understand her her mind returned to mrs elton s offences 
and long very long did they occupy her 
chapter xv 
emma was not required by any subsequent discovery to retract her ill 
opinion of mrs elton her observation had been pretty correct 
such as mrs elton appeared to her on this second interview 
such she appeared whenever they met again self important presuming 
familiar ignorant and ill bred she had a little beauty and a 
little accomplishment but so little judgment that she thought herself 
coming with superior knowledge of the world to enliven and improve 
a country neighbourhood and conceived miss hawkins to have held 
such a place in society as mrs elton s consequence only could surpass 
there was no reason to suppose mr elton thought at all differently 
from his wife he seemed not merely happy with her but proud 
he had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such 
a woman to highbury as not even miss woodhouse could equal 
and the greater part of her new acquaintance disposed to commend 
or not in the habit of judging following the lead of miss bates s 
good will or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever 
and as agreeable as she professed herself were very well satisfied 
so that mrs elton s praise passed from one mouth to another as it 
ought to do unimpeded by miss woodhouse who readily continued her 
first contribution and talked with a good grace of her being very 
pleasant and very elegantly dressed 
in one respect mrs elton grew even worse than she had appeared 
at first her feelings altered towards emma offended probably 
by the little encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with 
she drew back in her turn and gradually became much more cold 
and distant and though the effect was agreeable the ill will 
which produced it was necessarily increasing emma s dislike 
her manners too and mr elton s were unpleasant towards harriet 
they were sneering and negligent emma hoped it must rapidly work 
harriet s cure but the sensations which could prompt such behaviour 
sunk them both very much it was not to be doubted that poor 
harriet s attachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve 
and her own share in the story under a colouring the least favourable 
to her and the most soothing to him had in all likelihood been 
given also she was of course the object of their joint dislike 
when they had nothing else to say it must be always easy to begin 
abusing miss woodhouse and the enmity which they dared not shew 
in open disrespect to her found a broader vent in contemptuous 
treatment of harriet 
mrs elton took a great fancy to jane fairfax and from the first 
not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be 
supposed to recommend the other but from the very first and she 
was not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration 
but without solicitation or plea or privilege she must be wanting 
to assist and befriend her before emma had forfeited her confidence 
and about the third time of their meeting she heard all mrs elton s 
knight errantry on the subject 
jane fairfax is absolutely charming miss woodhouse i quite 
rave about jane fairfax a sweet interesting creature so mild 
and ladylike and with such talents i assure you i think she 
has very extraordinary talents i do not scruple to say that she 
plays extremely well i know enough of music to speak decidedly 
on that point oh she is absolutely charming you will laugh at 
my warmth but upon my word i talk of nothing but jane fairfax 
and her situation is so calculated to affect one miss woodhouse 
we must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her 
we must bring her forward such talent as hers must not be suffered 
to remain unknown i dare say you have heard those charming lines of 
the poet 
full many a flower is born to blush unseen 
and waste its fragrance on the desert air 
we must not allow them to be verified in sweet jane fairfax 
i cannot think there is any danger of it was emma s calm answer 
and when you are better acquainted with miss fairfax s situation 
and understand what her home has been with colonel and mrs campbell 
i have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown 
oh but dear miss woodhouse she is now in such retirement 
such obscurity so thrown away whatever advantages she may have 
enjoyed with the campbells are so palpably at an end and i think 
she feels it i am sure she does she is very timid and silent 
one can see that she feels the want of encouragement i like her 
the better for it i must confess it is a recommendation to me 
i am a great advocate for timidity and i am sure one does 
not often meet with it but in those who are at all inferior 
it is extremely prepossessing oh i assure you jane fairfax 
is a very delightful character and interests me more than i 
can express 
you appear to feel a great deal but i am not aware how you or any 
of miss fairfax s acquaintance here any of those who have known 
her longer than yourself can shew her any other attention than 
my dear miss woodhouse a vast deal may be done by those who dare 
to act you and i need not be afraid if we set the example 
many will follow it as far as they can though all have not 
our situations we have carriages to fetch and convey her home 
and we live in a style which could not make the addition of 
jane fairfax at any time the least inconvenient i should be 
extremely displeased if wright were to send us up such a dinner 
as could make me regret having asked more than jane fairfax 
to partake of it i have no idea of that sort of thing it is 
not likely that i should considering what i have been used to 
my greatest danger perhaps in housekeeping may be quite the 
other way in doing too much and being too careless of expense 
maple grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be 
for we do not at all affect to equal my brother mr suckling 
in income however my resolution is taken as to noticing jane fairfax 
i shall certainly have her very often at my house shall introduce 
her wherever i can shall have musical parties to draw out her talents 
and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation 
my acquaintance is so very extensive that i have little doubt 
of hearing of something to suit her shortly i shall introduce her 
of course very particularly to my brother and sister when they come 
to us i am sure they will like her extremely and when she gets 
a little acquainted with them her fears will completely wear off 
for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is 
highly conciliating i shall have her very often indeed while they 
are with me and i dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in 
the barouche landau in some of our exploring parties 
poor jane fairfax thought emma you have not deserved this 
you may have done wrong with regard to mr dixon but this is a 
punishment beyond what you can have merited the kindness and protection 
of mrs elton jane fairfax and jane fairfax heavens let me 
not suppose that she dares go about emma woodhouse ing me 
but upon my honour there seems no limits to the licentiousness 
of that woman s tongue 
emma had not to listen to such paradings again to any so exclusively 
addressed to herself so disgustingly decorated with a dear miss 
woodhouse the change on mrs elton s side soon afterwards appeared 
and she was left in peace neither forced to be the very particular 
friend of mrs elton nor under mrs elton s guidance the very 
active patroness of jane fairfax and only sharing with others in a 
general way in knowing what was felt what was meditated what was done 
she looked on with some amusement miss bates s gratitude for 
mrs elton s attentions to jane was in the first style of guileless 
simplicity and warmth she was quite one of her worthies 
the most amiable affable delightful woman just as accomplished 
and condescending as mrs elton meant to be considered 
emma s only surprize was that jane fairfax should accept 
those attentions and tolerate mrs elton as she seemed to do 
she heard of her walking with the eltons sitting with the eltons 
spending a day with the eltons this was astonishing she could not 
have believed it possible that the taste or the pride of miss fairfax 
could endure such society and friendship as the vicarage had to offer 
she is a riddle quite a riddle said she to chuse to remain 
here month after month under privations of every sort and now 
to chuse the mortification of mrs elton s notice and the penury 
of her conversation rather than return to the superior companions 
who have always loved her with such real generous affection 
jane had come to highbury professedly for three months the campbells 
were gone to ireland for three months but now the campbells 
had promised their daughter to stay at least till midsummer 
and fresh invitations had arrived for her to join them there 
according to miss bates it all came from her mrs dixon had 
written most pressingly would jane but go means were to be found 
servants sent friends contrived no travelling difficulty allowed 
to exist but still she had declined it 
she must have some motive more powerful than appears for refusing 
this invitation was emma s conclusion she must be under some 
sort of penance inflicted either by the campbells or herself 
there is great fear great caution great resolution somewhere 
she is not to be with the dixons the decree is issued by somebody 
but why must she consent to be with the eltons here is quite a 
separate puzzle 
upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject 
before the few who knew her opinion of mrs elton mrs weston 
ventured this apology for jane 
we cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the vicarage 
my dear emma but it is better than being always at home 
her aunt is a good creature but as a constant companion 
must be very tiresome we must consider what miss fairfax quits 
before we condemn her taste for what she goes to 
you are right mrs weston said mr knightley warmly miss fairfax 
is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of mrs elton 
could she have chosen with whom to associate she would not have 
chosen her but with a reproachful smile at emma she receives 
attentions from mrs elton which nobody else pays her 
emma felt that mrs weston was giving her a momentary glance 
and she was herself struck by his warmth with a faint blush 
she presently replied 
such attentions as mrs elton s i should have imagined 
would rather disgust than gratify miss fairfax mrs elton s 
invitations i should have imagined any thing but inviting 
i should not wonder said mrs weston if miss fairfax were to have 
been drawn on beyond her own inclination by her aunt s eagerness 
in accepting mrs elton s civilities for her poor miss bates may 
very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater 
appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated 
in spite of the very natural wish of a little change 
both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again and after a few 
minutes silence he said 
another thing must be taken into consideration too mrs elton 
does not talk to miss fairfax as she speaks of her we all know 
the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou the plainest 
spoken amongst us we all feel the influence of a something beyond 
common civility in our personal intercourse with each other 
a something more early implanted we cannot give any body the 
disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before 
we feel things differently and besides the operation of this 
as a general principle you may be sure that miss fairfax awes 
mrs elton by her superiority both of mind and manner and that 
face to face mrs elton treats her with all the respect which she 
has a claim to such a woman as jane fairfax probably never fell 
in mrs elton s way before and no degree of vanity can prevent 
her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action if not 
in consciousness 
i know how highly you think of jane fairfax said emma 
little henry was in her thoughts and a mixture of alarm and delicacy 
made her irresolute what else to say 
yes he replied any body may know how highly i think of her 
and yet said emma beginning hastily and with an arch look 
but soon stopping it was better however to know the worst at once 
she hurried on and yet perhaps you may hardly be aware yourself 
how highly it is the extent of your admiration may take you by 
surprize some day or other 
mr knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick 
leather gaiters and either the exertion of getting them together 
or some other because brought the colour into his face as he answered 
oh are you there but you are miserably behindhand mr cole 
gave me a hint of it six weeks ago 
he stopped emma felt her foot pressed by mrs weston and did 
not herself know what to think in a moment he went on 
that will never be however i can assure you miss fairfax 
i dare say would not have me if i were to ask her and i am very 
sure i shall never ask her 
emma returned her friend s pressure with interest and was pleased 
enough to exclaim 
you are not vain mr knightley i will say that for you 
he seemed hardly to hear her he was thoughtful and in a manner 
which shewed him not pleased soon afterwards said 
so you have been settling that i should marry jane fairfax 
no indeed i have not you have scolded me too much for match making 
for me to presume to take such a liberty with you what i said 
just now meant nothing one says those sort of things of course 
without any idea of a serious meaning oh no upon my word i have not 
the smallest wish for your marrying jane fairfax or jane any body 
you would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way 
if you were married 
mr knightley was thoughtful again the result of his reverie was 
no emma i do not think the extent of my admiration for her will 
ever take me by surprize i never had a thought of her in that way 
i assure you and soon afterwards jane fairfax is a very charming 
young woman but not even jane fairfax is perfect she has a fault 
she has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife 
emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault 
well said she and you soon silenced mr cole i suppose 
yes very soon he gave me a quiet hint i told him he was mistaken 
he asked my pardon and said no more cole does not want to be wiser 
or wittier than his neighbours 
in that respect how unlike dear mrs elton who wants to be wiser 
and wittier than all the world i wonder how she speaks of the coles 
what she calls them how can she find any appellation for them 
deep enough in familiar vulgarity she calls you knightley what can 
she do for mr cole and so i am not to be surprized that jane 
fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her 
mrs weston your argument weighs most with me i can much more 
readily enter into the temptation of getting away from miss bates 
than i can believe in the triumph of miss fairfax s mind over 
mrs elton i have no faith in mrs elton s acknowledging herself 
the inferior in thought word or deed or in her being under any 
restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good breeding i cannot 
imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor 
with praise encouragement and offers of service that she will not be 
continually detailing her magnificent intentions from the procuring 
her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful 
exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche landau 
jane fairfax has feeling said mr knightley i do not 
accuse her of want of feeling her sensibilities i suspect 
are strong and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance 
patience self controul but it wants openness she is reserved 
more reserved i think than she used to be and i love an 
open temper no till cole alluded to my supposed attachment 
it had never entered my head i saw jane fairfax and conversed with 
her with admiration and pleasure always but with no thought beyond 
well mrs weston said emma triumphantly when he left them 
what do you say now to mr knightley s marrying jane fairfax 
why really dear emma i say that he is so very much occupied 
by the idea of not being in love with her that i should not wonder 
if it were to end in his being so at last do not beat me 
chapter xvi 
every body in and about highbury who had ever visited mr elton 
was disposed to pay him attention on his marriage dinner parties and 
evening parties were made for him and his lady and invitations 
flowed in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending 
they were never to have a disengaged day 
i see how it is said she i see what a life i am to lead 
among you upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated 
we really seem quite the fashion if this is living in the country 
it is nothing very formidable from monday next to saturday 
i assure you we have not a disengaged day a woman with fewer 
resources than i have need not have been at a loss 
no invitation came amiss to her her bath habits made evening parties 
perfectly natural to her and maple grove had given her a taste 
for dinners she was a little shocked at the want of two 
drawing rooms at the poor attempt at rout cakes and there being 
no ice in the highbury card parties mrs bates mrs perry 
mrs goddard and others were a good deal behind hand in knowledge 
of the world but she would soon shew them how every thing ought 
to be arranged in the course of the spring she must return their 
civilities by one very superior party in which her card tables 
should be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs 
in the true style and more waiters engaged for the evening 
than their own establishment could furnish to carry round 
the refreshments at exactly the proper hour and in the proper order 
emma in the meanwhile could not be satisfied without a dinner 
at hartfield for the eltons they must not do less than others 
or she should be exposed to odious suspicions and imagined capable 
of pitiful resentment a dinner there must be after emma had 
talked about it for ten minutes mr woodhouse felt no unwillingness 
and only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom 
of the table himself with the usual regular difficulty of deciding 
who should do it for him 
the persons to be invited required little thought besides the eltons 
it must be the westons and mr knightley so far it was all of course 
and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little harriet must 
be asked to make the eighth but this invitation was not given 
with equal satisfaction and on many accounts emma was particularly 
pleased by harriet s begging to be allowed to decline it 
she would rather not be in his company more than she could help 
she was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy 
wife together without feeling uncomfortable if miss woodhouse 
would not be displeased she would rather stay at home 
it was precisely what emma would have wished had she deemed it 
possible enough for wishing she was delighted with the fortitude 
of her little friend for fortitude she knew it was in her to give 
up being in company and stay at home and she could now invite the 
very person whom she really wanted to make the eighth jane fairfax 
since her last conversation with mrs weston and mr knightley 
she was more conscience stricken about jane fairfax than she had 
often been mr knightley s words dwelt with her he had said 
that jane fairfax received attentions from mrs elton which nobody 
else paid her 
this is very true said she at least as far as relates to me 
which was all that was meant and it is very shameful of the same age 
and always knowing her i ought to have been more her friend 
she will never like me now i have neglected her too long but i 
will shew her greater attention than i have done 
every invitation was successful they were all disengaged and all happy 
the preparatory interest of this dinner however was not yet over 
a circumstance rather unlucky occurred the two eldest little 
knightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of 
some weeks in the spring and their papa now proposed bringing them 
and staying one whole day at hartfield which one day would be 
the very day of this party his professional engagements did 
not allow of his being put off but both father and daughter were 
disturbed by its happening so mr woodhouse considered eight 
persons at dinner together as the utmost that his nerves could bear 
and here would be a ninth and emma apprehended that it would 
be a ninth very much out of humour at not being able to come even 
to hartfield for forty eight hours without falling in with a dinner party 
she comforted her father better than she could comfort herself 
by representing that though he certainly would make them nine 
yet he always said so little that the increase of noise would be 
very immaterial she thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself 
to have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed 
to her instead of his brother 
the event was more favourable to mr woodhouse than to emma 
john knightley came but mr weston was unexpectedly summoned to town 
and must be absent on the very day he might be able to join them 
in the evening but certainly not to dinner mr woodhouse was quite 
at ease and the seeing him so with the arrival of the little boys 
and the philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate 
removed the chief of even emma s vexation 
the day came the party were punctually assembled and mr john knightley 
seemed early to devote himself to the business of being agreeable 
instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they waited 
for dinner he was talking to miss fairfax mrs elton as elegant 
as lace and pearls could make her he looked at in silence 
wanting only to observe enough for isabella s information but miss 
fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl and he could 
talk to her he had met her before breakfast as he was returning 
from a walk with his little boys when it had been just beginning 
to rain it was natural to have some civil hopes on the subject 
and he said 
i hope you did not venture far miss fairfax this morning or i 
am sure you must have been wet we scarcely got home in time 
i hope you turned directly 
i went only to the post office said she and reached home 
before the rain was much it is my daily errand i always fetch 
the letters when i am here it saves trouble and is a something 
to get me out a walk before breakfast does me good 
not a walk in the rain i should imagine 
no but it did not absolutely rain when i set out 
mr john knightley smiled and replied 
that is to say you chose to have your walk for you were not six 
yards from your own door when i had the pleasure of meeting you 
and henry and john had seen more drops than they could count long before 
the post office has a great charm at one period of our lives 
when you have lived to my age you will begin to think letters are 
never worth going through the rain for 
there was a little blush and then this answer 
i must not hope to be ever situated as you are in the midst of 
every dearest connexion and therefore i cannot expect that simply 
growing older should make me indifferent about letters 
indifferent oh no i never conceived you could become indifferent 
letters are no matter of indifference they are generally a very 
positive curse 
you are speaking of letters of business mine are letters 
of friendship 
i have often thought them the worst of the two replied he coolly 
business you know may bring money but friendship hardly 
ever does 
ah you are not serious now i know mr john knightley too well 
i am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as 
any body i can easily believe that letters are very little to you 
much less than to me but it is not your being ten years older than 
myself which makes the difference it is not age but situation 
you have every body dearest to you always at hand i probably 
never shall again and therefore till i have outlived all my affections 
a post office i think must always have power to draw me out 
in worse weather than to day 
when i talked of your being altered by time by the progress of years 
said john knightley i meant to imply the change of situation 
which time usually brings i consider one as including the other 
time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within 
the daily circle but that is not the change i had in view for you 
as an old friend you will allow me to hope miss fairfax that ten 
years hence you may have as many concentrated objects as i have 
it was kindly said and very far from giving offence a pleasant 
thank you seemed meant to laugh it off but a blush a quivering lip 
a tear in the eye shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh 
her attention was now claimed by mr woodhouse who being 
according to his custom on such occasions making the circle of 
his guests and paying his particular compliments to the ladies 
was ending with her and with all his mildest urbanity said 
i am very sorry to hear miss fairfax of your being out this 
morning in the rain young ladies should take care of themselves 
young ladies are delicate plants they should take care of their 
health and their complexion my dear did you change your stockings 
yes sir i did indeed and i am very much obliged by your kind 
solicitude about me 
my dear miss fairfax young ladies are very sure to be cared for 
i hope your good grand mama and aunt are well they are some 
of my very old friends i wish my health allowed me to be a 
better neighbour you do us a great deal of honour to day i am sure 
my daughter and i are both highly sensible of your goodness 
and have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at hartfield 
the kind hearted polite old man might then sit down and feel 
that he had done his duty and made every fair lady welcome and easy 
by this time the walk in the rain had reached mrs elton 
and her remonstrances now opened upon jane 
my dear jane what is this i hear going to the post office 
in the rain this must not be i assure you you sad girl 
how could you do such a thing it is a sign i was not there 
to take care of you 
jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold 
oh do not tell me you really are a very sad girl and do not 
know how to take care of yourself to the post office indeed 
mrs weston did you ever hear the like you and i must positively 
exert our authority 
my advice said mrs weston kindly and persuasively i certainly 
do feel tempted to give miss fairfax you must not run such risks 
liable as you have been to severe colds indeed you ought 
to be particularly careful especially at this time of year 
the spring i always think requires more than common care 
better wait an hour or two or even half a day for your letters 
than run the risk of bringing on your cough again now do not you 
feel that you had yes i am sure you are much too reasonable 
you look as if you would not do such a thing again 
oh she shall not do such a thing again eagerly rejoined 
mrs elton we will not allow her to do such a thing again 
and nodding significantly there must be some arrangement made 
there must indeed i shall speak to mr e the man who fetches 
our letters every morning one of our men i forget his name 
shall inquire for yours too and bring them to you that will obviate 
all difficulties you know and from us i really think my dear jane 
you can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation 
you are extremely kind said jane but i cannot give up my 
early walk i am advised to be out of doors as much as i can 
i must walk somewhere and the post office is an object and upon 
my word i have scarcely ever had a bad morning before 
my dear jane say no more about it the thing is determined 
that is laughing affectedly as far as i can presume to determine 
any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master you know 
mrs weston you and i must be cautious how we express ourselves 
but i do flatter myself my dear jane that my influence is not entirely 
worn out if i meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore 
consider that point as settled 
excuse me said jane earnestly i cannot by any means consent 
to such an arrangement so needlessly troublesome to your servant 
if the errand were not a pleasure to me it could be done as it 
always is when i am not here by my grandmama s 
oh my dear but so much as patty has to do and it is a kindness 
to employ our men 
jane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered but instead 
of answering she began speaking again to mr john knightley 
the post office is a wonderful establishment said she 
the regularity and despatch of it if one thinks of all that it 
has to do and all that it does so well it is really astonishing 
it is certainly very well regulated 
so seldom that any negligence or blunder appears so seldom 
that a letter among the thousands that are constantly passing 
about the kingdom is even carried wrong and not one in a million 
i suppose actually lost and when one considers the variety 
of hands and of bad hands too that are to be deciphered 
it increases the wonder 
the clerks grow expert from habit they must begin with some 
quickness of sight and hand and exercise improves them if you 
want any farther explanation continued he smiling they are 
paid for it that is the key to a great deal of capacity 
the public pays and must be served well 
the varieties of handwriting were farther talked of and the usual 
observations made 
i have heard it asserted said john knightley that the same 
sort of handwriting often prevails in a family and where the 
same master teaches it is natural enough but for that reason 
i should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females 
for boys have very little teaching after an early age and scramble 
into any hand they can get isabella and emma i think do write 
very much alike i have not always known their writing apart 
yes said his brother hesitatingly there is a likeness 
i know what you mean but emma s hand is the strongest 
isabella and emma both write beautifully said mr woodhouse 
and always did and so does poor mrs weston with half a sigh 
and half a smile at her 
i never saw any gentleman s handwriting emma began looking also 
at mrs weston but stopped on perceiving that mrs weston was 
attending to some one else and the pause gave her time to reflect 
now how am i going to introduce him am i unequal to speaking 
his name at once before all these people is it necessary 
for me to use any roundabout phrase your yorkshire friend 
your correspondent in yorkshire that would be the way i suppose 
if i were very bad no i can pronounce his name without the 
smallest distress i certainly get better and better now for it 
mrs weston was disengaged and emma began again mr frank churchill 
writes one of the best gentleman s hands i ever saw 
i do not admire it said mr knightley it is too small 
wants strength it is like a woman s writing 
this was not submitted to by either lady they vindicated him 
against the base aspersion no it by no means wanted strength 
it was not a large hand but very clear and certainly strong 
had not mrs weston any letter about her to produce no she had 
heard from him very lately but having answered the letter had put 
it away 
if we were in the other room said emma if i had my writing desk 
i am sure i could produce a specimen i have a note of his 
do not you remember mrs weston employing him to write for you 
one day 
he chose to say he was employed 
well well i have that note and can shew it after dinner 
to convince mr knightley 
oh when a gallant young man like mr frank churchill 
said mr knightley dryly writes to a fair lady like miss woodhouse 
he will of course put forth his best 
dinner was on table mrs elton before she could be spoken to 
was ready and before mr woodhouse had reached her with his request 
to be allowed to hand her into the dining parlour was saying 
must i go first i really am ashamed of always leading the way 
jane s solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped emma 
she had heard and seen it all and felt some curiosity to know 
whether the wet walk of this morning had produced any she suspected 
that it had that it would not have been so resolutely encountered 
but in full expectation of hearing from some one very dear 
and that it had not been in vain she thought there was an air 
of greater happiness than usual a glow both of complexion and spirits 
she could have made an inquiry or two as to the expedition 
and the expense of the irish mails it was at her tongue s end 
but she abstained she was quite determined not to utter a word 
that should hurt jane fairfax s feelings and they followed 
the other ladies out of the room arm in arm with an appearance 
of good will highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each 
chapter xvii 
when the ladies returned to the drawing room after dinner emma found 
it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties 
with so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did mrs elton 
engross jane fairfax and slight herself she and mrs weston were 
obliged to be almost always either talking together or silent together 
mrs elton left them no choice if jane repressed her for a 
little time she soon began again and though much that passed 
between them was in a half whisper especially on mrs elton s side 
there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects 
the post office catching cold fetching letters and friendship 
were long under discussion and to them succeeded one which must 
be at least equally unpleasant to jane inquiries whether she had 
yet heard of any situation likely to suit her and professions of 
mrs elton s meditated activity 
here is april come said she i get quite anxious about you 
june will soon be here 
but i have never fixed on june or any other month merely looked 
forward to the summer in general 
but have you really heard of nothing 
i have not even made any inquiry i do not wish to make any yet 
oh my dear we cannot begin too early you are not aware 
of the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing 
i not aware said jane shaking her head dear mrs elton 
who can have thought of it as i have done 
but you have not seen so much of the world as i have you do not 
know how many candidates there always are for the first situations 
i saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round maple grove 
a cousin of mr suckling mrs bragge had such an infinity 
of applications every body was anxious to be in her family 
for she moves in the first circle wax candles in the schoolroom 
you may imagine how desirable of all houses in the kingdom 
mrs bragge s is the one i would most wish to see you in 
colonel and mrs campbell are to be in town again by midsummer 
said jane i must spend some time with them i am sure they will 
want it afterwards i may probably be glad to dispose of myself 
but i would not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries 
at present 
trouble aye i know your scruples you are afraid of giving 
me trouble but i assure you my dear jane the campbells can 
hardly be more interested about you than i am i shall write 
to mrs partridge in a day or two and shall give her a strict 
charge to be on the look out for any thing eligible 
thank you but i would rather you did not mention the subject 
to her till the time draws nearer i do not wish to be giving 
any body trouble 
but my dear child the time is drawing near here is april 
and june or say even july is very near with such business 
to accomplish before us your inexperience really amuses me 
a situation such as you deserve and your friends would require for you 
is no everyday occurrence is not obtained at a moment s notice 
indeed indeed we must begin inquiring directly 
excuse me madam but this is by no means my intention i make no 
inquiry myself and should be sorry to have any made by my friends 
when i am quite determined as to the time i am not at all afraid 
of being long unemployed there are places in town offices 
where inquiry would soon produce something offices for the sale 
not quite of human flesh but of human intellect 
oh my dear human flesh you quite shock me if you mean a fling 
at the slave trade i assure you mr suckling was always rather 
a friend to the abolition 
i did not mean i was not thinking of the slave trade replied jane 
governess trade i assure you was all that i had in view 
widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on 
but as to the greater misery of the victims i do not know where 
it lies but i only mean to say that there are advertising offices 
and that by applying to them i should have no doubt of very soon 
meeting with something that would do 
something that would do repeated mrs elton aye that may 
suit your humble ideas of yourself i know what a modest creature 
you are but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up 
with any thing that may offer any inferior commonplace situation 
in a family not moving in a certain circle or able to command 
the elegancies of life 
you are very obliging but as to all that i am very indifferent 
it would be no object to me to be with the rich my mortifications 
i think would only be the greater i should suffer more from comparison 
a gentleman s family is all that i should condition for 
i know you i know you you would take up with any thing but i 
shall be a little more nice and i am sure the good campbells will 
be quite on my side with your superior talents you have a right 
to move in the first circle your musical knowledge alone would 
entitle you to name your own terms have as many rooms as you like 
and mix in the family as much as you chose that is i do not know 
if you knew the harp you might do all that i am very sure 
but you sing as well as play yes i really believe you might 
even without the harp stipulate for what you chose and you must 
and shall be delightfully honourably and comfortably settled before 
the campbells or i have any rest 
you may well class the delight the honour and the comfort 
of such a situation together said jane they are pretty sure 
to be equal however i am very serious in not wishing any thing 
to be attempted at present for me i am exceedingly obliged to you 
mrs elton i am obliged to any body who feels for me but i am 
quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer 
for two or three months longer i shall remain where i am and as 
i am 
and i am quite serious too i assure you replied mrs elton gaily 
in resolving to be always on the watch and employing my friends 
to watch also that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us 
in this style she ran on never thoroughly stopped by any thing 
till mr woodhouse came into the room her vanity had then a change 
of object and emma heard her saying in the same half whisper to jane 
here comes this dear old beau of mine i protest only think of his 
gallantry in coming away before the other men what a dear creature 
he is i assure you i like him excessively i admire all that quaint 
old fashioned politeness it is much more to my taste than modern ease 
modern ease often disgusts me but this good old mr woodhouse 
i wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner oh i assure 
you i began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous 
i fancy i am rather a favourite he took notice of my gown 
how do you like it selina s choice handsome i think but i 
do not know whether it is not over trimmed i have the greatest 
dislike to the idea of being over trimmed quite a horror of finery 
i must put on a few ornaments now because it is expected of me 
a bride you know must appear like a bride but my natural taste 
is all for simplicity a simple style of dress is so infinitely 
preferable to finery but i am quite in the minority i believe 
few people seem to value simplicity of dress show and finery 
are every thing i have some notion of putting such a trimming 
as this to my white and silver poplin do you think it will 
look well 
the whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing room 
when mr weston made his appearance among them he had returned 
to a late dinner and walked to hartfield as soon as it was over 
he had been too much expected by the best judges for surprize 
but there was great joy mr woodhouse was almost as glad to see 
him now as he would have been sorry to see him before john knightley 
only was in mute astonishment that a man who might have spent 
his evening quietly at home after a day of business in london 
should set off again and walk half a mile to another man s house 
for the sake of being in mixed company till bed time of finishing 
his day in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers 
was a circumstance to strike him deeply a man who had been in motion 
since eight of the clock in the morning and might now have been still 
who had been long talking and might have been silent who had been 
in more than one crowd and might have been alone such a man 
to quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside 
and on the evening of a cold sleety april day rush out again into 
the world could he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken 
back his wife there would have been a motive but his coming would 
probably prolong rather than break up the party john knightley 
looked at him with amazement then shrugged his shoulders and said 
i could not have believed it even of him 
mr weston meanwhile perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation 
he was exciting happy and cheerful as usual and with all 
the right of being principal talker which a day spent anywhere 
from home confers was making himself agreeable among the rest 
and having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner 
convincing her that none of all her careful directions to the servants 
had been forgotten and spread abroad what public news he had heard 
was proceeding to a family communication which though principally 
addressed to mrs weston he had not the smallest doubt of being 
highly interesting to every body in the room he gave her a letter 
it was from frank and to herself he had met with it in his way 
and had taken the liberty of opening it 
read it read it said he it will give you pleasure 
only a few lines will not take you long read it to emma 
the two ladies looked over it together and he sat smiling 
and talking to them the whole time in a voice a little subdued 
but very audible to every body 
well he is coming you see good news i think well what do 
you say to it i always told you he would be here again soon 
did not i anne my dear did not i always tell you so and you would 
not believe me in town next week you see at the latest i dare say 
for she is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is 
to be done most likely they will be there to morrow or saturday 
as to her illness all nothing of course but it is an excellent 
thing to have frank among us again so near as town they will stay 
a good while when they do come and he will be half his time with us 
this is precisely what i wanted well pretty good news is not it 
have you finished it has emma read it all put it up put it up 
we will have a good talk about it some other time but it will not 
do now i shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a 
common way 
mrs weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion 
her looks and words had nothing to restrain them she was happy 
she knew she was happy and knew she ought to be happy 
her congratulations were warm and open but emma could not speak 
so fluently she was a little occupied in weighing her own feelings 
and trying to understand the degree of her agitation which she 
rather thought was considerable 
mr weston however too eager to be very observant too communicative 
to want others to talk was very well satisfied with what she did say 
and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial 
communication of what the whole room must have overheard already 
it was well that he took every body s joy for granted or he 
might not have thought either mr woodhouse or mr knightley 
particularly delighted they were the first entitled 
after mrs weston and emma to be made happy from them he would 
have proceeded to miss fairfax but she was so deep in conversation 
with john knightley that it would have been too positive 
an interruption and finding himself close to mrs elton and 
her attention disengaged he necessarily began on the subject with her 
chapter xviii 
i hope i shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you 
said mr weston 
mrs elton very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended 
her by such a hope smiled most graciously 
you have heard of a certain frank churchill i presume he continued 
and know him to be my son though he does not bear my name 
oh yes and i shall be very happy in his acquaintance 
i am sure mr elton will lose no time in calling on him and we 
shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the vicarage 
you are very obliging frank will be extremely happy i am sure 
he is to be in town next week if not sooner we have notice of it 
in a letter to day i met the letters in my way this morning 
and seeing my son s hand presumed to open it though it was not directed 
to me it was to mrs weston she is his principal correspondent 
i assure you i hardly ever get a letter 
and so you absolutely opened what was directed to her oh mr weston 
laughing affectedly i must protest against that a most dangerous 
precedent indeed i beg you will not let your neighbours follow 
your example upon my word if this is what i am to expect 
we married women must begin to exert ourselves oh mr weston 
i could not have believed it of you 
aye we men are sad fellows you must take care of yourself 
mrs elton this letter tells us it is a short letter written in 
a hurry merely to give us notice it tells us that they are all 
coming up to town directly on mrs churchill s account she has 
not been well the whole winter and thinks enscombe too cold for her 
so they are all to move southward without loss of time 
indeed from yorkshire i think enscombe is in yorkshire 
yes they are about one hundred and ninety miles from london 
a considerable journey 
yes upon my word very considerable sixty five miles farther 
than from maple grove to london but what is distance mr weston 
to people of large fortune you would be amazed to hear how my brother 
mr suckling sometimes flies about you will hardly believe me 
but twice in one week he and mr bragge went to london and back again 
with four horses 
the evil of the distance from enscombe said mr weston is that 
mrs churchill as we understand has not been able to leave the 
sofa for a week together in frank s last letter she complained 
he said of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having 
both his arm and his uncle s this you know speaks a great degree 
of weakness but now she is so impatient to be in town that she 
means to sleep only two nights on the road so frank writes word 
certainly delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions 
mrs elton you must grant me that 
no indeed i shall grant you nothing i always take the part 
of my own sex i do indeed i give you notice you will find me 
a formidable antagonist on that point i always stand up for women 
and i assure you if you knew how selina feels with respect 
to sleeping at an inn you would not wonder at mrs churchill s 
making incredible exertions to avoid it selina says it is quite 
horror to her and i believe i have caught a little of her nicety 
she always travels with her own sheets an excellent precaution 
does mrs churchill do the same 
depend upon it mrs churchill does every thing that any other 
fine lady ever did mrs churchill will not be second to any lady 
in the land for 
mrs elton eagerly interposed with 
oh mr weston do not mistake me selina is no fine lady 
i assure you do not run away with such an idea 
is not she then she is no rule for mrs churchill who is 
as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld 
mrs elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly 
it was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister 
was not a fine lady perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence 
of it and she was considering in what way she had best retract 
when mr weston went on 
mrs churchill is not much in my good graces as you may suspect 
but this is quite between ourselves she is very fond of frank 
and therefore i would not speak ill of her besides she is out of 
health now but that indeed by her own account she has always been 
i would not say so to every body mrs elton but i have not much 
faith in mrs churchill s illness 
if she is really ill why not go to bath mr weston to bath 
or to clifton she has taken it into her head that enscombe is too 
cold for her the fact is i suppose that she is tired of enscombe 
she has now been a longer time stationary there than she ever 
was before and she begins to want change it is a retired place 
a fine place but very retired 
aye like maple grove i dare say nothing can stand more retired from 
the road than maple grove such an immense plantation all round it 
you seem shut out from every thing in the most complete retirement 
and mrs churchill probably has not health or spirits like selina 
to enjoy that sort of seclusion or perhaps she may not have 
resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life 
i always say a woman cannot have too many resources and i feel 
very thankful that i have so many myself as to be quite independent 
of society 
frank was here in february for a fortnight 
so i remember to have heard he will find an addition to the 
society of highbury when he comes again that is if i may presume 
to call myself an addition but perhaps he may never have heard 
of there being such a creature in the world 
this was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by 
and mr weston with a very good grace immediately exclaimed 
my dear madam nobody but yourself could imagine such a 
thing possible not heard of you i believe mrs weston s 
letters lately have been full of very little else than mrs elton 
he had done his duty and could return to his son 
when frank left us continued he it was quite uncertain when we 
might see him again which makes this day s news doubly welcome 
it has been completely unexpected that is i always had a strong 
persuasion he would be here again soon i was sure something 
favourable would turn up but nobody believed me he and mrs weston 
were both dreadfully desponding how could he contrive to come 
and how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare 
him again and so forth i always felt that something would happen 
in our favour and so it has you see i have observed mrs elton 
in the course of my life that if things are going untowardly one month 
they are sure to mend the next 
very true mr weston perfectly true it is just what i used 
to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship 
when because things did not go quite right did not proceed with all 
the rapidity which suited his feelings he was apt to be in despair 
and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be may before 
hymen s saffron robe would be put on for us oh the pains i have 
been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views 
the carriage we had disappointments about the carriage one morning 
i remember he came to me quite in despair 
she was stopped by a slight fit of coughing and mr weston instantly 
seized the opportunity of going on 
you were mentioning may may is the very month which mrs churchill 
is ordered or has ordered herself to spend in some warmer place 
than enscombe in short to spend in london so that we have the 
agreeable prospect of frequent visits from frank the whole spring 
precisely the season of the year which one should have chosen 
for it days almost at the longest weather genial and pleasant 
always inviting one out and never too hot for exercise when he 
was here before we made the best of it but there was a good deal 
of wet damp cheerless weather there always is in february you know 
and we could not do half that we intended now will be the time 
this will be complete enjoyment and i do not know mrs elton 
whether the uncertainty of our meetings the sort of constant 
expectation there will be of his coming in to day or to morrow 
and at any hour may not be more friendly to happiness than having 
him actually in the house i think it is so i think it is the 
state of mind which gives most spirit and delight i hope you 
will be pleased with my son but you must not expect a prodigy 
he is generally thought a fine young man but do not expect a prodigy 
mrs weston s partiality for him is very great and as you may suppose 
most gratifying to me she thinks nobody equal to him 
and i assure you mr weston i have very little doubt that my 
opinion will be decidedly in his favour i have heard so much 
in praise of mr frank churchill at the same time it is fair 
to observe that i am one of those who always judge for themselves 
and are by no means implicitly guided by others i give you notice 
that as i find your son so i shall judge of him i am no flatterer 
mr weston was musing 
i hope said he presently i have not been severe upon poor 
mrs churchill if she is ill i should be sorry to do her injustice 
but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult 
for me to speak of her with the forbearance i could wish 
you cannot be ignorant mrs elton of my connexion with the family 
nor of the treatment i have met with and between ourselves 
the whole blame of it is to be laid to her she was the instigator 
frank s mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her 
mr churchill has pride but his pride is nothing to his wife s 
his is a quiet indolent gentlemanlike sort of pride that would 
harm nobody and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome 
but her pride is arrogance and insolence and what inclines one less 
to bear she has no fair pretence of family or blood she was nobody 
when he married her barely the daughter of a gentleman but ever 
since her being turned into a churchill she has out churchill d them 
all in high and mighty claims but in herself i assure you she is 
an upstart 
only think well that must be infinitely provoking i have quite 
a horror of upstarts maple grove has given me a thorough disgust 
to people of that sort for there is a family in that neighbourhood 
who are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs 
they give themselves your description of mrs churchill made me 
think of them directly people of the name of tupman very lately 
settled there and encumbered with many low connexions but giving 
themselves immense airs and expecting to be on a footing with the old 
established families a year and a half is the very utmost that they can 
have lived at west hall and how they got their fortune nobody knows 
they came from birmingham which is not a place to promise much 
you know mr weston one has not great hopes from birmingham 
i always say there is something direful in the sound but nothing 
more is positively known of the tupmans though a good many things 
i assure you are suspected and yet by their manners they evidently 
think themselves equal even to my brother mr suckling who happens 
to be one of their nearest neighbours it is infinitely too bad 
mr suckling who has been eleven years a resident at maple grove 
and whose father had it before him i believe at least i am 
almost sure that old mr suckling had completed the purchase before 
his death 
they were interrupted tea was carrying round and mr weston 
having said all that he wanted soon took the opportunity of 
walking away 
after tea mr and mrs weston and mr elton sat down with mr woodhouse 
to cards the remaining five were left to their own powers 
and emma doubted their getting on very well for mr knightley seemed 
little disposed for conversation mrs elton was wanting notice 
which nobody had inclination to pay and she was herself 
in a worry of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent 
mr john knightley proved more talkative than his brother 
he was to leave them early the next day and he soon began with 
well emma i do not believe i have any thing more to say about 
the boys but you have your sister s letter and every thing is 
down at full length there we may be sure my charge would be much 
more concise than her s and probably not much in the same spirit 
all that i have to recommend being comprised in do not spoil them 
and do not physic them 
i rather hope to satisfy you both said emma for i shall do all 
in my power to make them happy which will be enough for isabella 
and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic 
and if you find them troublesome you must send them home again 
that is very likely you think so do not you 
i hope i am aware that they may be too noisy for your father 
or even may be some encumbrance to you if your visiting engagements 
continue to increase as much as they have done lately 
increase 
certainly you must be sensible that the last half year has made 
a great difference in your way of life 
difference no indeed i am not 
there can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company 
than you used to be witness this very time here am i come 
down for only one day and you are engaged with a dinner party 
when did it happen before or any thing like it your neighbourhood 
is increasing and you mix more with it a little while ago 
every letter to isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties 
dinners at mr cole s or balls at the crown the difference 
which randalls randalls alone makes in your goings on is very great 
yes said his brother quickly it is randalls that does it all 
very well and as randalls i suppose is not likely to have less 
influence than heretofore it strikes me as a possible thing emma 
that henry and john may be sometimes in the way and if they are 
i only beg you to send them home 
no cried mr knightley that need not be the consequence 
let them be sent to donwell i shall certainly be at leisure 
upon my word exclaimed emma you amuse me i should like to know 
how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being 
of the party and why i am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure 
to attend to the little boys these amazing engagements of mine 
what have they been dining once with the coles and having a ball 
talked of which never took place i can understand you nodding at 
mr john knightley your good fortune in meeting with so many of 
your friends at once here delights you too much to pass unnoticed 
but you turning to mr knightley who know how very very seldom 
i am ever two hours from hartfield why you should foresee such a 
series of dissipation for me i cannot imagine and as to my dear 
little boys i must say that if aunt emma has not time for them 
i do not think they would fare much better with uncle knightley 
who is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one 
and who when he is at home is either reading to himself or settling 
his accounts 
mr knightley seemed to be trying not to smile and succeeded 
without difficulty upon mrs elton s beginning to talk to him 
volume iii 
chapter i 
a very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy emma as to the 
nature of her agitation on hearing this news of frank churchill 
she was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at 
all apprehensive or embarrassed it was for him her own attachment 
had really subsided into a mere nothing it was not worth thinking of 
but if he who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love 
of the two were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment 
which he had taken away it would be very distressing if a separation 
of two months should not have cooled him there were dangers and evils 
before her caution for him and for herself would be necessary 
she did not mean to have her own affections entangled again 
and it would be incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his 
she wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration 
that would be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance 
and yet she could not help rather anticipating something decisive 
she felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a crisis 
an event a something to alter her present composed and tranquil state 
it was not very long though rather longer than mr weston had foreseen 
before she had the power of forming some opinion of frank churchill s 
feelings the enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had 
been imagined but he was at highbury very soon afterwards he rode 
down for a couple of hours he could not yet do more but as he came 
from randalls immediately to hartfield she could then exercise all 
her quick observation and speedily determine how he was influenced 
and how she must act they met with the utmost friendliness 
there could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her 
but she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he 
had done of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree 
she watched him well it was a clear thing he was less in love than he 
had been absence with the conviction probably of her indifference 
had produced this very natural and very desirable effect 
he was in high spirits as ready to talk and laugh as ever and seemed 
delighted to speak of his former visit and recur to old stories 
and he was not without agitation it was not in his calmness that 
she read his comparative difference he was not calm his spirits 
were evidently fluttered there was restlessness about him 
lively as he was it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself 
but what decided her belief on the subject was his staying only a 
quarter of an hour and hurrying away to make other calls in highbury 
he had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he passed 
he had not stopped he would not stop for more than a word but he 
had the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he did not call 
and much as he wished to stay longer at hartfield he must hurry off 
she had no doubt as to his being less in love but neither his 
agitated spirits nor his hurrying away seemed like a perfect cure 
and she was rather inclined to think it implied a dread of her 
returning power and a discreet resolution of not trusting himself 
with her long 
this was the only visit from frank churchill in the course of ten days 
he was often hoping intending to come but was always prevented 
his aunt could not bear to have him leave her such was his own account 
at randall s if he were quite sincere if he really tried to come 
it was to be inferred that mrs churchill s removal to london had 
been of no service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder 
that she was really ill was very certain he had declared himself 
convinced of it at randalls though much might be fancy he could 
not doubt when he looked back that she was in a weaker state 
of health than she had been half a year ago he did not believe it 
to proceed from any thing that care and medicine might not remove 
or at least that she might not have many years of existence before her 
but he could not be prevailed on by all his father s doubts to say 
that her complaints were merely imaginary or that she was as strong 
as ever 
it soon appeared that london was not the place for her she could 
not endure its noise her nerves were under continual irritation 
and suffering and by the ten days end her nephew s letter to 
randalls communicated a change of plan they were going to remove 
immediately to richmond mrs churchill had been recommended 
to the medical skill of an eminent person there and had otherwise 
a fancy for the place a ready furnished house in a favourite 
spot was engaged and much benefit expected from the change 
emma heard that frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement 
and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two 
months before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends 
for the house was taken for may and june she was told that now 
he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them 
almost as often as he could even wish 
emma saw how mr weston understood these joyous prospects he was 
considering her as the source of all the happiness they offered 
she hoped it was not so two months must bring it to the proof 
mr weston s own happiness was indisputable he was quite delighted 
it was the very circumstance he could have wished for now it would 
be really having frank in their neighbourhood what were nine miles 
to a young man an hour s ride he would be always coming over 
the difference in that respect of richmond and london was enough 
to make the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing 
him never sixteen miles nay eighteen it must be full eighteen 
to manchester street was a serious obstacle were he ever able 
to get away the day would be spent in coming and returning 
there was no comfort in having him in london he might as well be 
at enscombe but richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse 
better than nearer 
one good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal 
the ball at the crown it had not been forgotten before but it had 
been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day now however 
it was absolutely to be every preparation was resumed and very soon 
after the churchills had removed to richmond a few lines from frank 
to say that his aunt felt already much better for the change 
and that he had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty four 
hours at any given time induced them to name as early a day as possible 
mr weston s ball was to be a real thing a very few to morrows 
stood between the young people of highbury and happiness 
mr woodhouse was resigned the time of year lightened the evil 
to him may was better for every thing than february mrs bates 
was engaged to spend the evening at hartfield james had due notice 
and he sanguinely hoped that neither dear little henry nor dear 
little john would have any thing the matter with them while dear 
emma were gone 
chapter ii 
no misfortune occurred again to prevent the ball the day approached 
the day arrived and after a morning of some anxious watching 
frank churchill in all the certainty of his own self reached randalls 
before dinner and every thing was safe 
no second meeting had there yet been between him and emma 
the room at the crown was to witness it but it would be better 
than a common meeting in a crowd mr weston had been so very 
earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible 
after themselves for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the 
propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came 
that she could not refuse him and must therefore spend some quiet 
interval in the young man s company she was to convey harriet 
and they drove to the crown in good time the randalls party just 
sufficiently before them 
frank churchill seemed to have been on the watch and though 
he did not say much his eyes declared that he meant to have 
a delightful evening they all walked about together to see 
that every thing was as it should be and within a few minutes 
were joined by the contents of another carriage which emma 
could not hear the sound of at first without great surprize 
so unreasonably early she was going to exclaim but she presently 
found that it was a family of old friends who were coming like herself 
by particular desire to help mr weston s judgment and they were 
so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins who had been 
entreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness 
on the same errand that it seemed as if half the company might 
soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection 
emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which 
mr weston depended and felt that to be the favourite and 
intimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes 
was not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity 
she liked his open manners but a little less of open heartedness 
would have made him a higher character general benevolence 
but not general friendship made a man what he ought to be 
she could fancy such a man the whole party walked about 
and looked and praised again and then having nothing else to do 
formed a sort of half circle round the fire to observe in their 
various modes till other subjects were started that though may 
a fire in the evening was still very pleasant 
emma found that it was not mr weston s fault that the number 
of privy councillors was not yet larger they had stopped 
at mrs bates s door to offer the use of their carriage 
but the aunt and niece were to be brought by the eltons 
frank was standing by her but not steadily there was a restlessness 
which shewed a mind not at ease he was looking about he was going 
to the door he was watching for the sound of other carriages 
impatient to begin or afraid of being always near her 
mrs elton was spoken of i think she must be here soon said he 
i have a great curiosity to see mrs elton i have heard so much 
of her it cannot be long i think before she comes 
a carriage was heard he was on the move immediately 
but coming back said 
i am forgetting that i am not acquainted with her i have never seen 
either mr or mrs elton i have no business to put myself forward 
mr and mrs elton appeared and all the smiles and the proprieties passed 
but miss bates and miss fairfax said mr weston looking about 
we thought you were to bring them 
the mistake had been slight the carriage was sent for them now 
emma longed to know what frank s first opinion of mrs elton 
might be how he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress 
and her smiles of graciousness he was immediately qualifying 
himself to form an opinion by giving her very proper attention 
after the introduction had passed 
in a few minutes the carriage returned somebody talked of rain 
i will see that there are umbrellas sir said frank to his father 
miss bates must not be forgotten and away he went mr weston 
was following but mrs elton detained him to gratify him by her 
opinion of his son and so briskly did she begin that the young 
man himself though by no means moving slowly could hardly be out 
of hearing 
a very fine young man indeed mr weston you know i candidly told 
you i should form my own opinion and i am happy to say that i am 
extremely pleased with him you may believe me i never compliment 
i think him a very handsome young man and his manners are precisely 
what i like and approve so truly the gentleman without the least 
conceit or puppyism you must know i have a vast dislike to puppies 
quite a horror of them they were never tolerated at maple grove 
neither mr suckling nor me had ever any patience with them and we 
used sometimes to say very cutting things selina who is mild almost 
to a fault bore with them much better 
while she talked of his son mr weston s attention was chained 
but when she got to maple grove he could recollect that there were 
ladies just arriving to be attended to and with happy smiles must 
hurry away 
mrs elton turned to mrs weston i have no doubt of its being 
our carriage with miss bates and jane our coachman and horses are 
so extremely expeditious i believe we drive faster than any body 
what a pleasure it is to send one s carriage for a friend 
i understand you were so kind as to offer but another time it 
will be quite unnecessary you may be very sure i shall always 
take care of them 
miss bates and miss fairfax escorted by the two gentlemen 
walked into the room and mrs elton seemed to think it as much 
her duty as mrs weston s to receive them her gestures and 
movements might be understood by any one who looked on like emma 
but her words every body s words were soon lost under the 
incessant flow of miss bates who came in talking and had not 
finished her speech under many minutes after her being admitted 
into the circle at the fire as the door opened she was heard 
so very obliging of you no rain at all nothing to signify 
i do not care for myself quite thick shoes and jane declares 
well as soon as she was within the door well this is brilliant 
indeed this is admirable excellently contrived upon my word 
nothing wanting could not have imagined it so well lighted up 
jane jane look did you ever see any thing oh mr weston 
you must really have had aladdin s lamp good mrs stokes 
would not know her own room again i saw her as i came in 
she was standing in the entrance oh mrs stokes said i 
but i had not time for more she was now met by mrs weston 
very well i thank you madam i hope you are quite well 
very happy to hear it so afraid you might have a headache 
seeing you pass by so often and knowing how much trouble you must have 
delighted to hear it indeed ah dear mrs elton so obliged 
to you for the carriage excellent time jane and i quite ready 
did not keep the horses a moment most comfortable carriage 
oh and i am sure our thanks are due to you mrs weston on that score 
mrs elton had most kindly sent jane a note or we should have been 
but two such offers in one day never were such neighbours 
i said to my mother upon my word madam thank you my mother 
is remarkably well gone to mr woodhouse s i made her take 
her shawl for the evenings are not warm her large new shawl 
mrs dixon s wedding present so kind of her to think of my mother 
bought at weymouth you know mr dixon s choice there were 
three others jane says which they hesitated about some time 
colonel campbell rather preferred an olive my dear jane 
are you sure you did not wet your feet it was but a drop or two 
but i am so afraid but mr frank churchill was so extremely 
and there was a mat to step upon i shall never forget his 
extreme politeness oh mr frank churchill i must tell you 
my mother s spectacles have never been in fault since the rivet 
never came out again my mother often talks of your good nature 
does not she jane do not we often talk of mr frank churchill 
ah here is miss woodhouse dear miss woodhouse how do you do 
very well i thank you quite well this is meeting quite in fairy land 
such a transformation must not compliment i know eyeing emma 
most complacently that would be rude but upon my word miss woodhouse 
you do look how do you like jane s hair you are a judge 
she did it all herself quite wonderful how she does her hair 
no hairdresser from london i think could ah dr hughes i declare 
and mrs hughes must go and speak to dr and mrs hughes for 
a moment how do you do how do you do very well i thank you 
this is delightful is not it where is dear mr richard 
oh there he is do not disturb him much better employed talking 
to the young ladies how do you do mr richard i saw you the 
other day as you rode through the town mrs otway i protest 
and good mr otway and miss otway and miss caroline such a host 
of friends and mr george and mr arthur how do you do how do 
you all do quite well i am much obliged to you never better 
do not i hear another carriage who can this be very likely the 
worthy coles upon my word this is charming to be standing about 
among such friends and such a noble fire i am quite roasted 
no coffee i thank you for me never take coffee a little tea 
if you please sir by and bye no hurry oh here it comes 
every thing so good 
frank churchill returned to his station by emma and as soon as miss 
bates was quiet she found herself necessarily overhearing the 
discourse of mrs elton and miss fairfax who were standing a little 
way behind her he was thoughtful whether he were overhearing too 
she could not determine after a good many compliments to jane 
on her dress and look compliments very quietly and properly taken 
mrs elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself 
and it was how do you like my gown how do you like my trimming 
how has wright done my hair with many other relative questions 
all answered with patient politeness mrs elton then said 
nobody can think less of dress in general than i do but upon such 
an occasion as this when every body s eyes are so much upon me 
and in compliment to the westons who i have no doubt are giving 
this ball chiefly to do me honour i would not wish to be inferior 
to others and i see very few pearls in the room except mine 
so frank churchill is a capital dancer i understand we shall see 
if our styles suit a fine young man certainly is frank churchill 
i like him very well 
at this moment frank began talking so vigorously that emma could 
not but imagine he had overheard his own praises and did not want 
to hear more and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while 
till another suspension brought mrs elton s tones again distinctly 
forward mr elton had just joined them and his wife was exclaiming 
oh you have found us out at last have you in our seclusion 
i was this moment telling jane i thought you would begin to be 
impatient for tidings of us 
jane repeated frank churchill with a look of surprize and displeasure 
that is easy but miss fairfax does not disapprove it i suppose 
how do you like mrs elton said emma in a whisper 
not at all 
you are ungrateful 
ungrateful what do you mean then changing from a frown to 
a smile no do not tell me i do not want to know what you mean 
where is my father when are we to begin dancing 
emma could hardly understand him he seemed in an odd humour 
he walked off to find his father but was quickly back again with both 
mr and mrs weston he had met with them in a little perplexity 
which must be laid before emma it had just occurred to mrs weston 
that mrs elton must be asked to begin the ball that she would 
expect it which interfered with all their wishes of giving emma 
that distinction emma heard the sad truth with fortitude 
and what are we to do for a proper partner for her said mr weston 
she will think frank ought to ask her 
frank turned instantly to emma to claim her former promise 
and boasted himself an engaged man which his father looked his most 
perfect approbation of and it then appeared that mrs weston was 
wanting him to dance with mrs elton himself and that their business 
was to help to persuade him into it which was done pretty soon 
mr weston and mrs elton led the way mr frank churchill and miss 
woodhouse followed emma must submit to stand second to mrs elton 
though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her 
it was almost enough to make her think of marrying mrs elton had 
undoubtedly the advantage at this time in vanity completely gratified 
for though she had intended to begin with frank churchill she could 
not lose by the change mr weston might be his son s superior 
in spite of this little rub however emma was smiling with enjoyment 
delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming 
and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her 
she was more disturbed by mr knightley s not dancing than by any 
thing else there he was among the standers by where he ought not 
to be he ought to be dancing not classing himself with the husbands 
and fathers and whist players who were pretending to feel an interest 
in the dance till their rubbers were made up so young as he looked 
he could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere 
than where he had placed himself his tall firm upright figure 
among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men 
was such as emma felt must draw every body s eyes and excepting her 
own partner there was not one among the whole row of young men 
who could be compared with him he moved a few steps nearer 
and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike 
a manner with what natural grace he must have danced would he 
but take the trouble whenever she caught his eye she forced him 
to smile but in general he was looking grave she wished he could 
love a ballroom better and could like frank churchill better 
he seemed often observing her she must not flatter herself that he 
thought of her dancing but if he were criticising her behaviour 
she did not feel afraid there was nothing like flirtation between 
her and her partner they seemed more like cheerful easy friends 
than lovers that frank churchill thought less of her than he had done 
was indubitable 
the ball proceeded pleasantly the anxious cares the incessant 
attentions of mrs weston were not thrown away every body 
seemed happy and the praise of being a delightful ball 
which is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be 
was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this 
of very important very recordable events it was not more productive 
than such meetings usually are there was one however which emma 
thought something of the two last dances before supper were begun 
and harriet had no partner the only young lady sitting down 
and so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers that how there 
could be any one disengaged was the wonder but emma s wonder 
lessened soon afterwards on seeing mr elton sauntering about 
he would not ask harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided 
she was sure he would not and she was expecting him every moment to 
escape into the card room 
escape however was not his plan he came to the part of the room 
where the sitters by were collected spoke to some and walked about 
in front of them as if to shew his liberty and his resolution 
of maintaining it he did not omit being sometimes directly 
before miss smith or speaking to those who were close to her 
emma saw it she was not yet dancing she was working her way 
up from the bottom and had therefore leisure to look around 
and by only turning her head a little she saw it all when she was 
half way up the set the whole group were exactly behind her and she 
would no longer allow her eyes to watch but mr elton was so near 
that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took 
place between him and mrs weston and she perceived that his wife 
who was standing immediately above her was not only listening also 
but even encouraging him by significant glances the kind hearted 
gentle mrs weston had left her seat to join him and say do not 
you dance mr elton to which his prompt reply was most readily 
mrs weston if you will dance with me 
me oh no i would get you a better partner than myself 
i am no dancer 
if mrs gilbert wishes to dance said he i shall have great pleasure 
i am sure for though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man 
and that my dancing days are over it would give me very great 
pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like mrs gilbert 
mrs gilbert does not mean to dance but there is a young lady 
disengaged whom i should be very glad to see dancing miss smith 
miss smith oh i had not observed you are extremely obliging 
and if i were not an old married man but my dancing days are over 
mrs weston you will excuse me any thing else i should be most happy 
to do at your command but my dancing days are over 
mrs weston said no more and emma could imagine with what 
surprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat 
this was mr elton the amiable obliging gentle mr elton 
she looked round for a moment he had joined mr knightley at a 
little distance and was arranging himself for settled conversation 
while smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife 
she would not look again her heart was in a glow and she feared 
her face might be as hot 
in another moment a happier sight caught her mr knightley 
leading harriet to the set never had she been more surprized 
seldom more delighted than at that instant she was all pleasure 
and gratitude both for harriet and herself and longed to be 
thanking him and though too distant for speech her countenance 
said much as soon as she could catch his eye again 
his dancing proved to be just what she had believed it 
extremely good and harriet would have seemed almost too lucky 
if it had not been for the cruel state of things before and for 
the very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction 
which her happy features announced it was not thrown away on her 
she bounded higher than ever flew farther down the middle 
and was in a continual course of smiles 
mr elton had retreated into the card room looking emma trusted 
very foolish she did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife 
though growing very like her she spoke some of her feelings 
by observing audibly to her partner 
knightley has taken pity on poor little miss smith very goodnatured 
i declare 
supper was announced the move began and miss bates might be 
heard from that moment without interruption till her being 
seated at table and taking up her spoon 
jane jane my dear jane where are you here is your tippet 
mrs weston begs you to put on your tippet she says she is afraid 
there will be draughts in the passage though every thing has 
been done one door nailed up quantities of matting my dear jane 
indeed you must mr churchill oh you are too obliging 
how well you put it on so gratified excellent dancing indeed 
yes my dear i ran home as i said i should to help grandmama 
to bed and got back again and nobody missed me i set off without 
saying a word just as i told you grandmama was quite well 
had a charming evening with mr woodhouse a vast deal of chat 
and backgammon tea was made downstairs biscuits and baked apples 
and wine before she came away amazing luck in some of her throws 
and she inquired a great deal about you how you were amused 
and who were your partners oh said i i shall not forestall jane 
i left her dancing with mr george otway she will love to tell you 
all about it herself to morrow her first partner was mr elton 
i do not know who will ask her next perhaps mr william cox 
my dear sir you are too obliging is there nobody you would 
not rather i am not helpless sir you are most kind upon my word 
jane on one arm and me on the other stop stop let us stand 
a little back mrs elton is going dear mrs elton how elegant 
she looks beautiful lace now we all follow in her train 
quite the queen of the evening well here we are at the passage 
two steps jane take care of the two steps oh no there is 
but one well i was persuaded there were two how very odd 
i was convinced there were two and there is but one i never saw any 
thing equal to the comfort and style candles everywhere i was telling 
you of your grandmama jane there was a little disappointment 
the baked apples and biscuits excellent in their way you know 
but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus 
brought in at first and good mr woodhouse not thinking the 
asparagus quite boiled enough sent it all out again now there 
is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus 
so she was rather disappointed but we agreed we would not speak of it 
to any body for fear of its getting round to dear miss woodhouse 
who would be so very much concerned well this is brilliant 
i am all amazement could not have supposed any thing such 
elegance and profusion i have seen nothing like it since 
well where shall we sit where shall we sit anywhere so that 
jane is not in a draught where i sit is of no consequence 
oh do you recommend this side well i am sure mr churchill 
only it seems too good but just as you please what you direct 
in this house cannot be wrong dear jane how shall we ever 
recollect half the dishes for grandmama soup too bless me 
i should not be helped so soon but it smells most excellent and i 
cannot help beginning 
emma had no opportunity of speaking to mr knightley till 
after supper but when they were all in the ballroom again 
her eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked 
he was warm in his reprobation of mr elton s conduct it had been 
unpardonable rudeness and mrs elton s looks also received the due 
share of censure 
they aimed at wounding more than harriet said he emma why 
is it that they are your enemies 
he looked with smiling penetration and on receiving 
no answer added she ought not to be angry with you i suspect 
whatever he may be to that surmise you say nothing of course 
but confess emma that you did want him to marry harriet 
i did replied emma and they cannot forgive me 
he shook his head but there was a smile of indulgence with it 
and he only said 
i shall not scold you i leave you to your own reflections 
can you trust me with such flatterers does my vain spirit ever 
tell me i am wrong 
not your vain spirit but your serious spirit if one leads 
you wrong i am sure the other tells you of it 
i do own myself to have been completely mistaken in mr elton 
there is a littleness about him which you discovered and which i 
did not and i was fully convinced of his being in love with harriet 
it was through a series of strange blunders 
and in return for your acknowledging so much i will do you the justice 
to say that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for 
himself harriet smith has some first rate qualities which mrs elton 
is totally without an unpretending single minded artless girl 
infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such 
a woman as mrs elton i found harriet more conversable than i expected 
emma was extremely gratified they were interrupted by the bustle 
of mr weston calling on every body to begin dancing again 
come miss woodhouse miss otway miss fairfax what are you all doing 
come emma set your companions the example every body is lazy 
every body is asleep 
i am ready said emma whenever i am wanted 
whom are you going to dance with asked mr knightley 
she hesitated a moment and then replied with you if you will 
ask me 
will you said he offering his hand 
indeed i will you have shewn that you can dance and you know we 
are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper 
brother and sister no indeed 
chapter iii 
this little explanation with mr knightley gave emma considerable 
pleasure it was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball 
which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy she was 
extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting 
the eltons and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so 
much alike and his praise of harriet his concession in her favour 
was peculiarly gratifying the impertinence of the eltons which for 
a few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening had been 
the occasion of some of its highest satisfactions and she looked 
forward to another happy result the cure of harriet s infatuation 
from harriet s manner of speaking of the circumstance before they 
quitted the ballroom she had strong hopes it seemed as if her eyes 
were suddenly opened and she were enabled to see that mr elton 
was not the superior creature she had believed him the fever 
was over and emma could harbour little fear of the pulse being 
quickened again by injurious courtesy she depended on the evil 
feelings of the eltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed 
neglect that could be farther requisite harriet rational 
frank churchill not too much in love and mr knightley not 
wanting to quarrel with her how very happy a summer must be before her 
she was not to see frank churchill this morning he had told 
her that he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping 
at hartfield as he was to be at home by the middle of the day 
she did not regret it 
having arranged all these matters looked them through and put them all 
to rights she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up 
for the demands of the two little boys as well as of their grandpapa 
when the great iron sweep gate opened and two persons entered 
whom she had never less expected to see together frank churchill 
with harriet leaning on his arm actually harriet a moment 
sufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened 
harriet looked white and frightened and he was trying to cheer her 
the iron gates and the front door were not twenty yards asunder 
they were all three soon in the hall and harriet immediately sinking 
into a chair fainted away 
a young lady who faints must be recovered questions must be answered 
and surprizes be explained such events are very interesting 
but the suspense of them cannot last long a few minutes made emma 
acquainted with the whole 
miss smith and miss bickerton another parlour boarder at 
mrs goddard s who had been also at the ball had walked out together 
and taken a road the richmond road which though apparently public 
enough for safety had led them into alarm about half a mile 
beyond highbury making a sudden turn and deeply shaded by elms 
on each side it became for a considerable stretch very retired 
and when the young ladies had advanced some way into it 
they had suddenly perceived at a small distance before them 
on a broader patch of greensward by the side a party of gipsies 
a child on the watch came towards them to beg and miss bickerton 
excessively frightened gave a great scream and calling on harriet 
to follow her ran up a steep bank cleared a slight hedge at the top 
and made the best of her way by a short cut back to highbury 
but poor harriet could not follow she had suffered very much 
from cramp after dancing and her first attempt to mount the bank 
brought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerless 
and in this state and exceedingly terrified she had been obliged 
to remain 
how the trampers might have behaved had the young ladies been 
more courageous must be doubtful but such an invitation for attack 
could not be resisted and harriet was soon assailed by half a 
dozen children headed by a stout woman and a great boy all clamorous 
and impertinent in look though not absolutely in word more and 
more frightened she immediately promised them money and taking out 
her purse gave them a shilling and begged them not to want more 
or to use her ill she was then able to walk though but slowly 
and was moving away but her terror and her purse were too tempting 
and she was followed or rather surrounded by the whole gang 
demanding more 
in this state frank churchill had found her she trembling 
and conditioning they loud and insolent by a most fortunate 
chance his leaving highbury had been delayed so as to bring him 
to her assistance at this critical moment the pleasantness 
of the morning had induced him to walk forward and leave his 
horses to meet him by another road a mile or two beyond highbury 
and happening to have borrowed a pair of scissors the night before 
of miss bates and to have forgotten to restore them he had 
been obliged to stop at her door and go in for a few minutes 
he was therefore later than he had intended and being on foot 
was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them 
the terror which the woman and boy had been creating in harriet 
was then their own portion he had left them completely frightened 
and harriet eagerly clinging to him and hardly able to speak 
had just strength enough to reach hartfield before her spirits 
were quite overcome it was his idea to bring her to hartfield 
he had thought of no other place 
this was the amount of the whole story of his communication and 
of harriet s as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech 
he dared not stay longer than to see her well these several delays 
left him not another minute to lose and emma engaging to give 
assurance of her safety to mrs goddard and notice of there 
being such a set of people in the neighbourhood to mr knightley 
he set off with all the grateful blessings that she could utter 
for her friend and herself 
such an adventure as this a fine young man and a lovely young 
woman thrown together in such a way could hardly fail of suggesting 
certain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain 
so emma thought at least could a linguist could a grammarian 
could even a mathematician have seen what she did have witnessed their 
appearance together and heard their history of it without feeling 
that circumstances had been at work to make them peculiarly interesting 
to each other how much more must an imaginist like herself 
be on fire with speculation and foresight especially with such 
a groundwork of anticipation as her mind had already made 
it was a very extraordinary thing nothing of the sort had ever 
occurred before to any young ladies in the place within her memory 
no rencontre no alarm of the kind and now it had happened 
to the very person and at the very hour when the other very 
person was chancing to pass by to rescue her it certainly 
was very extraordinary and knowing as she did the favourable 
state of mind of each at this period it struck her the more 
he was wishing to get the better of his attachment to herself 
she just recovering from her mania for mr elton it seemed as if 
every thing united to promise the most interesting consequences 
it was not possible that the occurrence should not be strongly 
recommending each to the other 
in the few minutes conversation which she had yet had with him 
while harriet had been partially insensible he had spoken of her terror 
her naivete her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm with a 
sensibility amused and delighted and just at last after harriet s 
own account had been given he had expressed his indignation 
at the abominable folly of miss bickerton in the warmest terms 
every thing was to take its natural course however neither impelled 
nor assisted she would not stir a step nor drop a hint 
no she had had enough of interference there could be no harm 
in a scheme a mere passive scheme it was no more than a wish 
beyond it she would on no account proceed 
emma s first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge 
of what had passed aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion 
but she soon felt that concealment must be impossible within half 
an hour it was known all over highbury it was the very event 
to engage those who talk most the young and the low and all 
the youth and servants in the place were soon in the happiness of 
frightful news the last night s ball seemed lost in the gipsies 
poor mr woodhouse trembled as he sat and as emma had foreseen 
would scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go 
beyond the shrubbery again it was some comfort to him that many 
inquiries after himself and miss woodhouse for his neighbours 
knew that he loved to be inquired after as well as miss smith 
were coming in during the rest of the day and he had the pleasure 
of returning for answer that they were all very indifferent 
which though not exactly true for she was perfectly well 
and harriet not much otherwise emma would not interfere with 
she had an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such 
a man for she hardly knew what indisposition was and if he did not 
invent illnesses for her she could make no figure in a message 
the gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice they took 
themselves off in a hurry the young ladies of highbury might have 
walked again in safety before their panic began and the whole 
history dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to emma 
and her nephews in her imagination it maintained its ground 
and henry and john were still asking every day for the story of 
harriet and the gipsies and still tenaciously setting her right 
if she varied in the slightest particular from the original recital 
chapter iv 
a very few days had passed after this adventure when harriet came 
one morning to emma with a small parcel in her hand and after 
sitting down and hesitating thus began 
miss woodhouse if you are at leisure i have something that i 
should like to tell you a sort of confession to make and then 
you know it will be over 
emma was a good deal surprized but begged her to speak 
there was a seriousness in harriet s manner which prepared her 
quite as much as her words for something more than ordinary 
it is my duty and i am sure it is my wish she continued 
to have no reserves with you on this subject as i am happily 
quite an altered creature in one respect it is very fit that you 
should have the satisfaction of knowing it i do not want to say 
more than is necessary i am too much ashamed of having given way 
as i have done and i dare say you understand me 
yes said emma i hope i do 
how i could so long a time be fancying myself 
cried harriet warmly it seems like madness i can see nothing 
at all extraordinary in him now i do not care whether i meet 
him or not except that of the two i had rather not see him 
and indeed i would go any distance round to avoid him but i do 
not envy his wife in the least i neither admire her nor envy her 
as i have done she is very charming i dare say and all that 
but i think her very ill tempered and disagreeable i shall never forget 
her look the other night however i assure you miss woodhouse 
i wish her no evil no let them be ever so happy together 
it will not give me another moment s pang and to convince you 
that i have been speaking truth i am now going to destroy what i 
ought to have destroyed long ago what i ought never to have kept 
i know that very well blushing as she spoke however now i 
will destroy it all and it is my particular wish to do it 
in your presence that you may see how rational i am grown 
cannot you guess what this parcel holds said she with a conscious look 
not the least in the world did he ever give you any thing 
no i cannot call them gifts but they are things that i have 
valued very much 
she held the parcel towards her and emma read the words most 
precious treasures on the top her curiosity was greatly excited 
harriet unfolded the parcel and she looked on with impatience 
within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little tunbridge ware box 
which harriet opened it was well lined with the softest cotton 
but excepting the cotton emma saw only a small piece of court plaister 
now said harriet you must recollect 
no indeed i do not 
dear me i should not have thought it possible you could forget 
what passed in this very room about court plaister one of the very 
last times we ever met in it it was but a very few days before i 
had my sore throat just before mr and mrs john knightley came 
i think the very evening do not you remember his cutting his finger 
with your new penknife and your recommending court plaister 
but as you had none about you and knew i had you desired 
me to supply him and so i took mine out and cut him a piece 
but it was a great deal too large and he cut it smaller and kept 
playing some time with what was left before he gave it back to me 
and so then in my nonsense i could not help making a treasure of it 
so i put it by never to be used and looked at it now and then 
as a great treat 
my dearest harriet cried emma putting her hand before her face 
and jumping up you make me more ashamed of myself than i can bear 
remember it aye i remember it all now all except your saving 
this relic i knew nothing of that till this moment but the cutting 
the finger and my recommending court plaister and saying i had none 
about me oh my sins my sins and i had plenty all the while in 
my pocket one of my senseless tricks i deserve to be under a 
continual blush all the rest of my life well sitting down again 
go on what else 
and had you really some at hand yourself i am sure i never 
suspected it you did it so naturally 
and so you actually put this piece of court plaister by for his sake 
said emma recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided 
between wonder and amusement and secretly she added to herself 
lord bless me when should i ever have thought of putting by in cotton 
a piece of court plaister that frank churchill had been pulling about 
i never was equal to this 
here resumed harriet turning to her box again here is 
something still more valuable i mean that has been more valuable 
because this is what did really once belong to him which the 
court plaister never did 
emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure it was the end 
of an old pencil the part without any lead 
this was really his said harriet do not you remember 
one morning no i dare say you do not but one morning i forget 
exactly the day but perhaps it was the tuesday or wednesday before 
that evening he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket book 
it was about spruce beer mr knightley had been telling him 
something about brewing spruce beer and he wanted to put it down 
but when he took out his pencil there was so little lead that he 
soon cut it all away and it would not do so you lent him another 
and this was left upon the table as good for nothing but i kept 
my eye on it and as soon as i dared caught it up and never 
parted with it again from that moment 
i do remember it cried emma i perfectly remember it 
talking about spruce beer oh yes mr knightley and i both saying we 
liked it and mr elton s seeming resolved to learn to like it too 
i perfectly remember it stop mr knightley was standing just here 
was not he i have an idea he was standing just here 
ah i do not know i cannot recollect it is very odd 
but i cannot recollect mr elton was sitting here i remember 
much about where i am now 
well go on 
oh that is all i have nothing more to shew you or to say 
except that i am now going to throw them both behind the fire 
and i wish you to see me do it 
my poor dear harriet and have you actually found happiness 
in treasuring up these things 
yes simpleton as i was but i am quite ashamed of it now and wish 
i could forget as easily as i can burn them it was very wrong 
of me you know to keep any remembrances after he was married 
i knew it was but had not resolution enough to part with them 
but harriet is it necessary to burn the court plaister i have 
not a word to say for the bit of old pencil but the court plaister 
might be useful 
i shall be happier to burn it replied harriet it has 
a disagreeable look to me i must get rid of every thing 
there it goes and there is an end thank heaven of mr elton 
and when thought emma will there be a beginning of mr churchill 
she had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was 
already made and could not but hope that the gipsy though she had 
told no fortune might be proved to have made harriet s about a 
fortnight after the alarm they came to a sufficient explanation 
and quite undesignedly emma was not thinking of it at the moment 
which made the information she received more valuable 
she merely said in the course of some trivial chat well harriet 
whenever you marry i would advise you to do so and so and thought 
no more of it till after a minute s silence she heard harriet 
say in a very serious tone i shall never marry 
emma then looked up and immediately saw how it was and after a 
moment s debate as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not replied 
never marry this is a new resolution 
it is one that i shall never change however 
after another short hesitation i hope it does not proceed from 
i hope it is not in compliment to mr elton 
mr elton indeed cried harriet indignantly oh no and emma 
could just catch the words so superior to mr elton 
she then took a longer time for consideration should she proceed 
no farther should she let it pass and seem to suspect nothing 
perhaps harriet might think her cold or angry if she did 
or perhaps if she were totally silent it might only drive 
harriet into asking her to hear too much and against any thing 
like such an unreserve as had been such an open and frequent 
discussion of hopes and chances she was perfectly resolved 
she believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at once 
all that she meant to say and know plain dealing was always best 
she had previously determined how far she would proceed 
on any application of the sort and it would be safer for both 
to have the judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed 
she was decided and thus spoke 
harriet i will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning 
your resolution or rather your expectation of never marrying 
results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer 
would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you 
is not it so 
oh miss woodhouse believe me i have not the presumption to suppose 
indeed i am not so mad but it is a pleasure to me to admire him 
at a distance and to think of his infinite superiority to all 
the rest of the world with the gratitude wonder and veneration 
which are so proper in me especially 
i am not at all surprized at you harriet the service he rendered 
you was enough to warm your heart 
service oh it was such an inexpressible obligation 
the very recollection of it and all that i felt at the time 
when i saw him coming his noble look and my wretchedness before 
such a change in one moment such a change from perfect misery 
to perfect happiness 
it is very natural it is natural and it is honourable 
yes honourable i think to chuse so well and so gratefully 
but that it will be a fortunate preference is more that i can promise 
i do not advise you to give way to it harriet i do not by any 
means engage for its being returned consider what you are about 
perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can 
at any rate do not let them carry you far unless you are persuaded 
of his liking you be observant of him let his behaviour be the 
guide of your sensations i give you this caution now because i 
shall never speak to you again on the subject i am determined 
against all interference henceforward i know nothing of the matter 
let no name ever pass our lips we were very wrong before 
we will be cautious now he is your superior no doubt and there 
do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature 
but yet harriet more wonderful things have taken place there have 
been matches of greater disparity but take care of yourself 
i would not have you too sanguine though however it may end 
be assured your raising your thoughts to him is a mark of good taste 
which i shall always know how to value 
harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude 
emma was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing 
for her friend its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind 
and it must be saving her from the danger of degradation 
chapter v 
in this state of schemes and hopes and connivance june opened 
upon hartfield to highbury in general it brought no material change 
the eltons were still talking of a visit from the sucklings 
and of the use to be made of their barouche landau and jane fairfax 
was still at her grandmother s and as the return of the campbells 
from ireland was again delayed and august instead of midsummer 
fixed for it she was likely to remain there full two months longer 
provided at least she were able to defeat mrs elton s activity 
in her service and save herself from being hurried into a delightful 
situation against her will 
mr knightley who for some reason best known to himself had certainly 
taken an early dislike to frank churchill was only growing to dislike 
him more he began to suspect him of some double dealing in his 
pursuit of emma that emma was his object appeared indisputable 
every thing declared it his own attentions his father s hints 
his mother in law s guarded silence it was all in unison 
words conduct discretion and indiscretion told the same story 
but while so many were devoting him to emma and emma herself making him 
over to harriet mr knightley began to suspect him of some inclination 
to trifle with jane fairfax he could not understand it but there 
were symptoms of intelligence between them he thought so at least 
symptoms of admiration on his side which having once observed 
he could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning 
however he might wish to escape any of emma s errors of imagination 
she was not present when the suspicion first arose he was dining 
with the randalls family and jane at the eltons and he had 
seen a look more than a single look at miss fairfax which 
from the admirer of miss woodhouse seemed somewhat out of place 
when he was again in their company he could not help remembering 
what he had seen nor could he avoid observations which unless it 
were like cowper and his fire at twilight 
myself creating what i saw 
brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something 
of private liking of private understanding even between frank 
churchill and jane 
he had walked up one day after dinner as he very often did 
to spend his evening at hartfield emma and harriet were going 
to walk he joined them and on returning they fell in with a 
larger party who like themselves judged it wisest to take their 
exercise early as the weather threatened rain mr and mrs weston 
and their son miss bates and her niece who had accidentally met 
they all united and on reaching hartfield gates emma who knew it 
was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father 
pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him the randalls 
party agreed to it immediately and after a pretty long speech 
from miss bates which few persons listened to she also found it 
possible to accept dear miss woodhouse s most obliging invitation 
as they were turning into the grounds mr perry passed by on horseback 
the gentlemen spoke of his horse 
by the bye said frank churchill to mrs weston presently 
what became of mr perry s plan of setting up his carriage 
mrs weston looked surprized and said i did not know that he 
ever had any such plan 
nay i had it from you you wrote me word of it three months ago 
me impossible 
indeed you did i remember it perfectly you mentioned it as 
what was certainly to be very soon mrs perry had told somebody 
and was extremely happy about it it was owing to her persuasion 
as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal 
of harm you must remember it now 
upon my word i never heard of it till this moment 
never really never bless me how could it be then i must 
have dreamt it but i was completely persuaded miss smith 
you walk as if you were tired you will not be sorry to find 
yourself at home 
what is this what is this cried mr weston about perry 
and a carriage is perry going to set up his carriage frank 
i am glad he can afford it you had it from himself had you 
no sir replied his son laughing i seem to have had it 
from nobody very odd i really was persuaded of mrs weston s 
having mentioned it in one of her letters to enscombe many weeks ago 
with all these particulars but as she declares she never heard 
a syllable of it before of course it must have been a dream i am 
a great dreamer i dream of every body at highbury when i am away 
and when i have gone through my particular friends then i begin 
dreaming of mr and mrs perry 
it is odd though observed his father that you should have had such 
a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you 
should be thinking of at enscombe perry s setting up his carriage 
and his wife s persuading him to it out of care for his health 
just what will happen i have no doubt some time or other 
only a little premature what an air of probability sometimes 
runs through a dream and at others what a heap of absurdities 
it is well frank your dream certainly shews that highbury is in 
your thoughts when you are absent emma you are a great dreamer 
i think 
emma was out of hearing she had hurried on before her guests 
to prepare her father for their appearance and was beyond the reach 
of mr weston s hint 
why to own the truth cried miss bates who had been trying in vain 
to be heard the last two minutes if i must speak on this subject 
there is no denying that mr frank churchill might have i do not 
mean to say that he did not dream it i am sure i have sometimes 
the oddest dreams in the world but if i am questioned about it 
i must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring 
for mrs perry herself mentioned it to my mother and the coles 
knew of it as well as ourselves but it was quite a secret 
known to nobody else and only thought of about three days 
mrs perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage and came 
to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she 
had prevailed jane do not you remember grandmama s telling us 
of it when we got home i forget where we had been walking to 
very likely to randalls yes i think it was to randalls 
mrs perry was always particularly fond of my mother indeed i do 
not know who is not and she had mentioned it to her in confidence 
she had no objection to her telling us of course but it was not 
to go beyond and from that day to this i never mentioned it 
to a soul that i know of at the same time i will not positively 
answer for my having never dropt a hint because i know i do 
sometimes pop out a thing before i am aware i am a talker 
you know i am rather a talker and now and then i have let a thing 
escape me which i should not i am not like jane i wish i were 
i will answer for it she never betrayed the least thing in the world 
where is she oh just behind perfectly remember mrs perry s coming 
extraordinary dream indeed 
they were entering the hall mr knightley s eyes had preceded 
miss bates s in a glance at jane from frank churchill s face 
where he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away 
he had involuntarily turned to hers but she was indeed behind 
and too busy with her shawl mr weston had walked in the two 
other gentlemen waited at the door to let her pass mr knightley 
suspected in frank churchill the determination of catching her eye 
he seemed watching her intently in vain however if it were so 
jane passed between them into the hall and looked at neither 
there was no time for farther remark or explanation the dream must 
be borne with and mr knightley must take his seat with the rest round 
the large modern circular table which emma had introduced at hartfield 
and which none but emma could have had power to place there and 
persuade her father to use instead of the small sized pembroke 
on which two of his daily meals had for forty years been crowded 
tea passed pleasantly and nobody seemed in a hurry to move 
miss woodhouse said frank churchill after examining a table 
behind him which he could reach as he sat have your nephews taken 
away their alphabets their box of letters it used to stand here 
where is it this is a sort of dull looking evening that ought 
to be treated rather as winter than summer we had great amusement 
with those letters one morning i want to puzzle you again 
emma was pleased with the thought and producing the box the table 
was quickly scattered over with alphabets which no one seemed so much 
disposed to employ as their two selves they were rapidly forming 
words for each other or for any body else who would be puzzled 
the quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for 
mr woodhouse who had often been distressed by the more animated sort 
which mr weston had occasionally introduced and who now sat happily 
occupied in lamenting with tender melancholy over the departure 
of the poor little boys or in fondly pointing out as he took 
up any stray letter near him how beautifully emma had written it 
frank churchill placed a word before miss fairfax she gave 
a slight glance round the table and applied herself to it 
frank was next to emma jane opposite to them and mr knightley 
so placed as to see them all and it was his object to see as much 
as he could with as little apparent observation the word 
was discovered and with a faint smile pushed away if meant 
to be immediately mixed with the others and buried from sight 
she should have looked on the table instead of looking just across 
for it was not mixed and harriet eager after every fresh word 
and finding out none directly took it up and fell to work 
she was sitting by mr knightley and turned to him for help 
the word was blunder and as harriet exultingly proclaimed it 
there was a blush on jane s cheek which gave it a meaning not 
otherwise ostensible mr knightley connected it with the dream 
but how it could all be was beyond his comprehension 
how the delicacy the discretion of his favourite could have been 
so lain asleep he feared there must be some decided involvement 
disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him at every turn 
these letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick 
it was a child s play chosen to conceal a deeper game on frank 
churchill s part 
with great indignation did he continue to observe him with great 
alarm and distrust to observe also his two blinded companions 
he saw a short word prepared for emma and given to her with a look 
sly and demure he saw that emma had soon made it out and found 
it highly entertaining though it was something which she judged it 
proper to appear to censure for she said nonsense for shame 
he heard frank churchill next say with a glance towards jane 
i will give it to her shall i and as clearly heard emma 
opposing it with eager laughing warmth no no you must not 
you shall not indeed 
it was done however this gallant young man who seemed to love 
without feeling and to recommend himself without complaisance 
directly handed over the word to miss fairfax and with a particular 
degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it mr knightley s 
excessive curiosity to know what this word might be made him seize 
every possible moment for darting his eye towards it and it was 
not long before he saw it to be dixon jane fairfax s perception 
seemed to accompany his her comprehension was certainly more equal 
to the covert meaning the superior intelligence of those five letters 
so arranged she was evidently displeased looked up and seeing 
herself watched blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her 
and saying only i did not know that proper names were allowed 
pushed away the letters with even an angry spirit and looked 
resolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered 
her face was averted from those who had made the attack and turned 
towards her aunt 
aye very true my dear cried the latter though jane had not 
spoken a word i was just going to say the same thing it is time 
for us to be going indeed the evening is closing in and grandmama 
will be looking for us my dear sir you are too obliging 
we really must wish you good night 
jane s alertness in moving proved her as ready as her aunt 
had preconceived she was immediately up and wanting to quit 
the table but so many were also moving that she could not get away 
and mr knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously 
pushed towards her and resolutely swept away by her unexamined 
she was afterwards looking for her shawl frank churchill was 
looking also it was growing dusk and the room was in confusion 
and how they parted mr knightley could not tell 
he remained at hartfield after all the rest his thoughts full 
of what he had seen so full that when the candles came to assist 
his observations he must yes he certainly must as a friend 
an anxious friend give emma some hint ask her some question 
he could not see her in a situation of such danger without trying to 
preserve her it was his duty 
pray emma said he may i ask in what lay the great amusement 
the poignant sting of the last word given to you and miss fairfax 
i saw the word and am curious to know how it could be so very 
entertaining to the one and so very distressing to the other 
emma was extremely confused she could not endure to give him the 
true explanation for though her suspicions were by no means removed 
she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them 
oh she cried in evident embarrassment it all meant nothing 
a mere joke among ourselves 
the joke he replied gravely seemed confined to you 
and mr churchill 
he had hoped she would speak again but she did not she would 
rather busy herself about any thing than speak he sat a little 
while in doubt a variety of evils crossed his mind interference 
fruitless interference emma s confusion and the acknowledged intimacy 
seemed to declare her affection engaged yet he would speak 
he owed it to her to risk any thing that might be involved in 
an unwelcome interference rather than her welfare to encounter 
any thing rather than the remembrance of neglect in such a because 
my dear emma said he at last with earnest kindness do you 
think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between 
the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of 
between mr frank churchill and miss fairfax oh yes perfectly 
why do you make a doubt of it 
have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her 
or that she admired him 
never never she cried with a most open eagerness never for 
the twentieth part of a moment did such an idea occur to me 
and how could it possibly come into your head 
i have lately imagined that i saw symptoms of attachment between them 
certain expressive looks which i did not believe meant to be public 
oh you amuse me excessively i am delighted to find that you 
can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander but it will not do 
very sorry to check you in your first essay but indeed it will 
not do there is no admiration between them i do assure you 
and the appearances which have caught you have arisen from some 
peculiar circumstances feelings rather of a totally different nature 
it is impossible exactly to explain there is a good deal of 
nonsense in it but the part which is capable of being communicated 
which is sense is that they are as far from any attachment or 
admiration for one another as any two beings in the world can be 
that is i presume it to be so on her side and i can answer for its 
being so on his i will answer for the gentleman s indifference 
she spoke with a confidence which staggered with a satisfaction 
which silenced mr knightley she was in gay spirits and would 
have prolonged the conversation wanting to hear the particulars 
of his suspicions every look described and all the where is and how is 
of a circumstance which highly entertained her but his gaiety did 
not meet hers he found he could not be useful and his feelings 
were too much irritated for talking that he might not be irritated 
into an absolute fever by the fire which mr woodhouse s tender 
habits required almost every evening throughout the year he soon 
afterwards took a hasty leave and walked home to the coolness 
and solitude of donwell abbey 
chapter vi 
after being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from mr and 
mrs suckling the highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification 
of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn 
no such importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores 
at present in the daily interchange of news they must be again 
restricted to the other topics with which for a while the sucklings 
coming had been united such as the last accounts of mrs churchill 
whose health seemed every day to supply a different report 
and the situation of mrs weston whose happiness it was to be hoped 
might eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child 
as that of all her neighbours was by the approach of it 
mrs elton was very much disappointed it was the delay of a great 
deal of pleasure and parade her introductions and recommendations 
must all wait and every projected party be still only talked of 
so she thought at first but a little consideration convinced 
her that every thing need not be put off why should not they 
explore to box hill though the sucklings did not come they could 
go there again with them in the autumn it was settled that they 
should go to box hill that there was to be such a party had been 
long generally known it had even given the idea of another 
emma had never been to box hill she wished to see what every body 
found so well worth seeing and she and mr weston had agreed 
to chuse some fine morning and drive thither two or three more 
of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them and it was to 
be done in a quiet unpretending elegant way infinitely superior 
to the bustle and preparation the regular eating and drinking 
and picnic parade of the eltons and the sucklings 
this was so very well understood between them that emma could 
not but feel some surprise and a little displeasure on hearing 
from mr weston that he had been proposing to mrs elton as her 
brother and sister had failed her that the two parties should unite 
and go together and that as mrs elton had very readily acceded 
to it so it was to be if she had no objection now as her 
objection was nothing but her very great dislike of mrs elton 
of which mr weston must already be perfectly aware it was not worth 
bringing forward again it could not be done without a reproof 
to him which would be giving pain to his wife and she found 
herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she 
would have done a great deal to avoid an arrangement which would 
probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of 
mrs elton s party every feeling was offended and the forbearance 
of her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity 
in her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of mr weston s temper 
i am glad you approve of what i have done said he very comfortably 
but i thought you would such schemes as these are nothing 
without numbers one cannot have too large a party a large party 
secures its own amusement and she is a good natured woman after all 
one could not leave her out 
emma denied none of it aloud and agreed to none of it in private 
it was now the middle of june and the weather fine and mrs elton 
was growing impatient to name the day and settle with mr weston 
as to pigeon pies and cold lamb when a lame carriage horse threw 
every thing into sad uncertainty it might be weeks it might be 
only a few days before the horse were useable but no preparations 
could be ventured on and it was all melancholy stagnation 
mrs elton s resources were inadequate to such an attack 
is not this most vexations knightley she cried and such weather 
for exploring these delays and disappointments are quite odious 
what are we to do the year will wear away at this rate 
and nothing done before this time last year i assure you we had 
had a delightful exploring party from maple grove to kings weston 
you had better explore to donwell replied mr knightley 
that may be done without horses come and eat my strawberries 
they are ripening fast 
if mr knightley did not begin seriously he was obliged to proceed so 
for his proposal was caught at with delight and the oh i should 
like it of all things was not plainer in words than manner 
donwell was famous for its strawberry beds which seemed a plea for 
the invitation but no plea was necessary cabbage beds would have 
been enough to tempt the lady who only wanted to be going somewhere 
she promised him again and again to come much oftener than 
he doubted and was extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy 
such a distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it 
you may depend upon me said she i certainly will come 
name your day and i will come you will allow me to bring 
jane fairfax 
i cannot name a day said he till i have spoken to some others 
whom i would wish to meet you 
oh leave all that to me only give me a carte blanche i am 
lady patroness you know it is my party i will bring friends 
with me 
i hope you will bring elton said he but i will not trouble 
you to give any other invitations 
oh now you are looking very sly but consider you need not be afraid 
of delegating power to me i am no young lady on her preferment 
married women you know may be safely authorised it is my party 
leave it all to me i will invite your guests 
no he calmly replied there is but one married woman in the world 
whom i can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to donwell 
and that one is 
mrs weston i suppose interrupted mrs elton rather mortified 
no mrs knightley and till she is in being i will manage 
such matters myself 
ah you are an odd creature she cried satisfied to have no 
one preferred to herself you are a humourist and may say what 
you like quite a humourist well i shall bring jane with me 
jane and her aunt the rest i leave to you i have no objections 
at all to meeting the hartfield family do not scruple i know 
you are attached to them 
you certainly will meet them if i can prevail and i shall call 
on miss bates in my way home 
that is quite unnecessary i see jane every day but as you like 
it is to be a morning scheme you know knightley quite a simple thing 
i shall wear a large bonnet and bring one of my little baskets 
hanging on my arm here probably this basket with pink ribbon 
nothing can be more simple you see and jane will have such another 
there is to be no form or parade a sort of gipsy party we are 
to walk about your gardens and gather the strawberries ourselves 
and sit under trees and whatever else you may like to provide 
it is to be all out of doors a table spread in the shade you know 
every thing as natural and simple as possible is not that your idea 
not quite my idea of the simple and the natural will be to have 
the table spread in the dining room the nature and the simplicity 
of gentlemen and ladies with their servants and furniture i think 
is best observed by meals within doors when you are tired of eating 
strawberries in the garden there shall be cold meat in the house 
well as you please only do not have a great set out and by the bye 
can i or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion 
pray be sincere knightley if you wish me to talk to mrs hodges 
or to inspect anything 
i have not the least wish for it i thank you 
well but if any difficulties should arise my housekeeper 
is extremely clever 
i will answer for it that mine thinks herself full as clever 
and would spurn any body s assistance 
i wish we had a donkey the thing would be for us all to come 
on donkeys jane miss bates and me and my caro sposo walking by 
i really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey in a country 
life i conceive it to be a sort of necessary for let a woman have 
ever so many resources it is not possible for her to be always shut 
up at home and very long walks you know in summer there is dust 
and in winter there is dirt 
you will not find either between donwell and highbury 
donwell lane is never dusty and now it is perfectly dry come on 
a donkey however if you prefer it you can borrow mrs cole s 
i would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible 
that i am sure you would indeed i do you justice my good friend 
under that peculiar sort of dry blunt manner i know you have the 
warmest heart as i tell mr e you are a thorough humourist 
yes believe me knightley i am fully sensible of your attention 
to me in the whole of this scheme you have hit upon the very thing 
to please me 
mr knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade 
he wished to persuade mr woodhouse as well as emma to join the party 
and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors 
to eat would inevitably make him ill mr woodhouse must not 
under the specious pretence of a morning drive and an hour or two 
spent at donwell be tempted away to his misery 
he was invited on good faith no lurking horrors were to upbraid 
him for his easy credulity he did consent he had not been 
at donwell for two years some very fine morning he and emma 
and harriet could go very well and he could sit still with 
mrs weston while the dear girls walked about the gardens 
he did not suppose they could be damp now in the middle of 
the day he should like to see the old house again exceedingly 
and should be very happy to meet mr and mrs elton and any other 
of his neighbours he could not see any objection at all to his 
and emma s and harriet s going there some very fine morning 
he thought it very well done of mr knightley to invite them 
very kind and sensible much cleverer than dining out he was not 
fond of dining out 
mr knightley was fortunate in every body s most ready concurrence 
the invitation was everywhere so well received that it seemed as if 
like mrs elton they were all taking the scheme as a particular 
compliment to themselves emma and harriet professed very high 
expectations of pleasure from it and mr weston unasked 
promised to get frank over to join them if possible a proof 
of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with 
mr knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad 
to see him and mr weston engaged to lose no time in writing 
and spare no arguments to induce him to come 
in the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast that the party 
to box hill was again under happy consideration and at last donwell 
was settled for one day and box hill for the next the weather 
appearing exactly right 
under a bright mid day sun at almost midsummer mr woodhouse 
was safely conveyed in his carriage with one window down 
to partake of this al fresco party and in one of the most 
comfortable rooms in the abbey especially prepared for him by a 
fire all the morning he was happily placed quite at his ease 
ready to talk with pleasure of what had been achieved and advise 
every body to come and sit down and not to heat themselves 
mrs weston who seemed to have walked there on purpose to be tired 
and sit all the time with him remained when all the others 
were invited or persuaded out his patient listener and sympathiser 
it was so long since emma had been at the abbey that as soon as she 
was satisfied of her father s comfort she was glad to leave him 
and look around her eager to refresh and correct her memory with 
more particular observation more exact understanding of a house 
and grounds which must ever be so interesting to her and all her family 
she felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance 
with the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant 
as she viewed the respectable size and style of the building 
its suitable becoming characteristic situation low and sheltered 
its ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream 
of which the abbey with all the old neglect of prospect 
had scarcely a sight and its abundance of timber in rows and avenues 
which neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up the house 
was larger than hartfield and totally unlike it covering a good 
deal of ground rambling and irregular with many comfortable 
and one or two handsome rooms it was just what it ought to be 
and it looked what it was and emma felt an increasing respect 
for it as the residence of a family of such true gentility 
untainted in blood and understanding some faults of temper john 
knightley had but isabella had connected herself unexceptionably 
she had given them neither men nor names nor places that could 
raise a blush these were pleasant feelings and she walked about 
and indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did 
and collect round the strawberry beds the whole party were assembled 
excepting frank churchill who was expected every moment from richmond 
and mrs elton in all her apparatus of happiness her large bonnet 
and her basket was very ready to lead the way in gathering 
accepting or talking strawberries and only strawberries 
could now be thought or spoken of the best fruit in england 
every body s favourite always wholesome these the finest beds 
and finest sorts delightful to gather for one s self the only way 
of really enjoying them morning decidedly the best time never tired 
every sort good hautboy infinitely superior no comparison 
the others hardly eatable hautboys very scarce chili preferred 
white wood finest flavour of all price of strawberries in london 
abundance about bristol maple grove cultivation beds when to 
be renewed gardeners thinking exactly different no general rule 
gardeners never to be put out of their way delicious fruit 
only too rich to be eaten much of inferior to cherries 
currants more refreshing only objection to gathering strawberries 
the stooping glaring sun tired to death could bear it no longer 
must go and sit in the shade 
such for half an hour was the conversation interrupted only 
once by mrs weston who came out in her solicitude after her 
son in law to inquire if he were come and she was a little uneasy 
she had some fears of his horse 
seats tolerably in the shade were found and now emma was obliged 
to overhear what mrs elton and jane fairfax were talking of 
a situation a most desirable situation was in question mrs elton 
had received notice of it that morning and was in raptures 
it was not with mrs suckling it was not with mrs bragge 
but in felicity and splendour it fell short only of them it was 
with a cousin of mrs bragge an acquaintance of mrs suckling 
a lady known at maple grove delightful charming superior 
first circles spheres lines ranks every thing and mrs elton 
was wild to have the offer closed with immediately on her side 
all was warmth energy and triumph and she positively refused 
to take her friend s negative though miss fairfax continued 
to assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing 
repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before 
still mrs elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence 
by the morrow s post how jane could bear it at all was astonishing 
to emma she did look vexed she did speak pointedly and at last 
with a decision of action unusual to her proposed a removal 
should not they walk would not mr knightley shew them the gardens 
all the gardens she wished to see the whole extent the pertinacity 
of her friend seemed more than she could bear 
it was hot and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered 
dispersed way scarcely any three together they insensibly 
followed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short 
avenue of limes which stretching beyond the garden at an equal 
distance from the river seemed the finish of the pleasure grounds 
it led to nothing nothing but a view at the end over a low stone 
wall with high pillars which seemed intended in their erection 
to give the appearance of an approach to the house which never had 
been there disputable however as might be the taste of such 
a termination it was in itself a charming walk and the view 
which closed it extremely pretty the considerable slope at nearly 
the foot of which the abbey stood gradually acquired a steeper 
form beyond its grounds and at half a mile distant was a bank 
of considerable abruptness and grandeur well clothed with wood 
and at the bottom of this bank favourably placed and sheltered 
rose the abbey mill farm with meadows in front and the river 
making a close and handsome curve around it 
it was a sweet view sweet to the eye and the mind english verdure 
english culture english comfort seen under a sun bright 
without being oppressive 
in this walk emma and mr weston found all the others assembled 
and towards this view she immediately perceived mr knightley 
and harriet distinct from the rest quietly leading the way 
mr knightley and harriet it was an odd tete a tete but she was 
glad to see it there had been a time when he would have scorned 
her as a companion and turned from her with little ceremony 
now they seemed in pleasant conversation there had been a time 
also when emma would have been sorry to see harriet in a spot 
so favourable for the abbey mill farm but now she feared it not 
it might be safely viewed with all its appendages of prosperity 
and beauty its rich pastures spreading flocks orchard in blossom 
and light column of smoke ascending she joined them at the wall 
and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around 
he was giving harriet information as to modes of agriculture etc 
and emma received a smile which seemed to say these are my 
own concerns i have a right to talk on such subjects without being 
suspected of introducing robert martin she did not suspect him 
it was too old a story robert martin had probably ceased to think 
of harriet they took a few turns together along the walk the shade 
was most refreshing and emma found it the pleasantest part of 
the day 
the next remove was to the house they must all go in and eat 
and they were all seated and busy and still frank churchill did 
not come mrs weston looked and looked in vain his father would 
not own himself uneasy and laughed at her fears but she could 
not be cured of wishing that he would part with his black mare 
he had expressed himself as to coming with more than common certainty 
his aunt was so much better that he had not a doubt of getting 
over to them mrs churchill s state however as many were ready 
to remind her was liable to such sudden variation as might disappoint 
her nephew in the most reasonable dependence and mrs weston 
was at last persuaded to believe or to say that it must be 
by some attack of mrs churchill that he was prevented coming 
emma looked at harriet while the point was under consideration 
she behaved very well and betrayed no emotion 
the cold repast was over and the party were to go out once more 
to see what had not yet been seen the old abbey fish ponds 
perhaps get as far as the clover which was to be begun cutting 
on the morrow or at any rate have the pleasure of being hot 
and growing cool again mr woodhouse who had already taken 
his little round in the highest part of the gardens where no 
damps from the river were imagined even by him stirred no more 
and his daughter resolved to remain with him that mrs weston 
might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and variety 
which her spirits seemed to need 
mr knightley had done all in his power for mr woodhouse s 
entertainment books of engravings drawers of medals cameos 
corals shells and every other family collection within his cabinets 
had been prepared for his old friend to while away the morning 
and the kindness had perfectly answered mr woodhouse had been 
exceedingly well amused mrs weston had been shewing them all to him 
and now he would shew them all to emma fortunate in having no other 
resemblance to a child than in a total want of taste for what he saw 
for he was slow constant and methodical before this second looking 
over was begun however emma walked into the hall for the sake 
of a few moments free observation of the entrance and ground plot 
of the house and was hardly there when jane fairfax appeared 
coming quickly in from the garden and with a look of escape 
little expecting to meet miss woodhouse so soon there was a start 
at first but miss woodhouse was the very person she was in quest of 
will you be so kind said she when i am missed as to say 
that i am gone home i am going this moment my aunt is not aware 
how late it is nor how long we have been absent but i am sure we 
shall be wanted and i am determined to go directly i have said 
nothing about it to any body it would only be giving trouble 
and distress some are gone to the ponds and some to the lime walk 
till they all come in i shall not be missed and when they do 
will you have the goodness to say that i am gone 
certainly if you wish it but you are not going to walk 
to highbury alone 
yes what should hurt me i walk fast i shall be at home 
in twenty minutes 
but it is too far indeed it is to be walking quite alone 
let my father s servant go with you let me order the carriage 
it can be round in five minutes 
thank you thank you but on no account i would rather walk 
and for me to be afraid of walking alone i who may so soon have 
to guard others 
she spoke with great agitation and emma very feelingly replied 
that can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now 
i must order the carriage the heat even would be danger you are 
fatigued already 
i am she answered i am fatigued but it is not the sort 
of fatigue quick walking will refresh me miss woodhouse we all 
know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits mine i confess 
are exhausted the greatest kindness you can shew me will be to let 
me have my own way and only say that i am gone when it is necessary 
emma had not another word to oppose she saw it all and entering 
into her feelings promoted her quitting the house immediately 
and watched her safely off with the zeal of a friend her parting 
look was grateful and her parting words oh miss woodhouse 
the comfort of being sometimes alone seemed to burst from 
an overcharged heart and to describe somewhat of the continual 
endurance to be practised by her even towards some of those who 
loved her best 
such a home indeed such an aunt said emma as she turned back 
into the hall again i do pity you and the more sensibility 
you betray of their just horrors the more i shall like you 
jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour and they had only 
accomplished some views of st mark s place venice when frank 
churchill entered the room emma had not been thinking of him 
she had forgotten to think of him but she was very glad to see him 
mrs weston would be at ease the black mare was blameless 
they were right who had named mrs churchill as the because 
he had been detained by a temporary increase of illness in her 
a nervous seizure which had lasted some hours and he had quite given 
up every thought of coming till very late and had he known how hot 
a ride he should have and how late with all his hurry he must be 
he believed he should not have come at all the heat was excessive 
he had never suffered any thing like it almost wished he had staid 
at home nothing killed him like heat he could bear any degree of cold 
etc but heat was intolerable and he sat down at the greatest 
possible distance from the slight remains of mr woodhouse s fire 
looking very deplorable 
you will soon be cooler if you sit still said emma 
as soon as i am cooler i shall go back again i could very 
ill be spared but such a point had been made of my coming 
you will all be going soon i suppose the whole party breaking up 
i met one as i came madness in such weather absolute madness 
emma listened and looked and soon perceived that frank churchill s 
state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being 
out of humour some people were always cross when they were hot 
such might be his constitution and as she knew that eating 
and drinking were often the cure of such incidental complaints 
she recommended his taking some refreshment he would find abundance 
of every thing in the dining room and she humanely pointed out 
the door 
no he should not eat he was not hungry it would only make 
him hotter in two minutes however he relented in his own favour 
and muttering something about spruce beer walked off emma returned 
all her attention to her father saying in secret 
i am glad i have done being in love with him i should not like a 
man who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning harriet s sweet 
easy temper will not mind it 
he was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal and came 
back all the better grown quite cool and with good manners 
like himself able to draw a chair close to them take an interest 
in their employment and regret in a reasonable way that he 
should be so late he was not in his best spirits but seemed 
trying to improve them and at last made himself talk nonsense 
very agreeably they were looking over views in swisserland 
as soon as my aunt gets well i shall go abroad said he 
i shall never be easy till i have seen some of these places 
you will have my sketches some time or other to look at or my tour 
to read or my poem i shall do something to expose myself 
that may be but not by sketches in swisserland you will 
never go to swisserland your uncle and aunt will never allow 
you to leave england 
they may be induced to go too a warm climate may be prescribed 
for her i have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad 
i assure you i have i feel a strong persuasion this morning 
that i shall soon be abroad i ought to travel i am tired 
of doing nothing i want a change i am serious miss woodhouse 
whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy i am sick of england 
and would leave it to morrow if i could 
you are sick of prosperity and indulgence cannot you invent 
a few hardships for yourself and be contented to stay 
i sick of prosperity and indulgence you are quite mistaken 
i do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged i am 
thwarted in every thing material i do not consider myself at all 
a fortunate person 
you are not quite so miserable though as when you first came 
go and eat and drink a little more and you will do very well 
another slice of cold meat another draught of madeira and water 
will make you nearly on a par with the rest of us 
no i shall not stir i shall sit by you you are my best cure 
we are going to box hill to morrow you will join us 
it is not swisserland but it will be something for a young 
man so much in want of a change you will stay and go with us 
no certainly not i shall go home in the cool of the evening 
but you may come again in the cool of to morrow morning 
no it will not be worth while if i come i shall be cross 
then pray stay at richmond 
but if i do i shall be crosser still i can never bear to think 
of you all there without me 
these are difficulties which you must settle for yourself 
chuse your own degree of crossness i shall press you no more 
the rest of the party were now returning and all were soon collected 
with some there was great joy at the sight of frank churchill 
others took it very composedly but there was a very general distress 
and disturbance on miss fairfax s disappearance being explained 
that it was time for every body to go concluded the subject and with 
a short final arrangement for the next day s scheme they parted 
frank churchill s little inclination to exclude himself increased 
so much that his last words to emma were 
well if you wish me to stay and join the party i will 
she smiled her acceptance and nothing less than a summons from 
richmond was to take him back before the following evening 
chapter vii 
they had a very fine day for box hill and all the other outward 
circumstances of arrangement accommodation and punctuality 
were in favour of a pleasant party mr weston directed the whole 
officiating safely between hartfield and the vicarage and every 
body was in good time emma and harriet went together miss bates 
and her niece with the eltons the gentlemen on horseback 
mrs weston remained with mr woodhouse nothing was wanting 
but to be happy when they got there seven miles were travelled 
in expectation of enjoyment and every body had a burst of admiration 
on first arriving but in the general amount of the day there 
was deficiency there was a languor a want of spirits a want of union 
which could not be got over they separated too much into parties 
the eltons walked together mr knightley took charge of miss 
bates and jane and emma and harriet belonged to frank churchill 
and mr weston tried in vain to make them harmonise better it seemed 
at first an accidental division but it never materially varied 
mr and mrs elton indeed shewed no unwillingness to mix 
and be as agreeable as they could but during the two whole hours 
that were spent on the hill there seemed a principle of separation 
between the other parties too strong for any fine prospects or any 
cold collation or any cheerful mr weston to remove 
at first it was downright dulness to emma she had never seen frank 
churchill so silent and stupid he said nothing worth hearing 
looked without seeing admired without intelligence listened without 
knowing what she said while he was so dull it was no wonder that 
harriet should be dull likewise and they were both insufferable 
when they all sat down it was better to her taste a great deal better 
for frank churchill grew talkative and gay making her his first object 
every distinguishing attention that could be paid was paid to her 
to amuse her and be agreeable in her eyes seemed all that he 
cared for and emma glad to be enlivened not sorry to be flattered 
was gay and easy too and gave him all the friendly encouragement 
the admission to be gallant which she had ever given in the first 
and most animating period of their acquaintance but which now 
in her own estimation meant nothing though in the judgment of most 
people looking on it must have had such an appearance as no english 
word but flirtation could very well describe mr frank churchill 
and miss woodhouse flirted together excessively they were laying 
themselves open to that very phrase and to having it sent off 
in a letter to maple grove by one lady to ireland by another 
not that emma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity 
it was rather because she felt less happy than she had expected 
she laughed because she was disappointed and though she liked him 
for his attentions and thought them all whether in friendship 
admiration or playfulness extremely judicious they were not winning 
back her heart she still intended him for her friend 
how much i am obliged to you said he for telling me to come to day 
if it had not been for you i should certainly have lost all the 
happiness of this party i had quite determined to go away again 
yes you were very cross and i do not know what about 
except that you were too late for the best strawberries 
i was a kinder friend than you deserved but you were humble 
you begged hard to be commanded to come 
do not say i was cross i was fatigued the heat overcame me 
it is hotter to day 
not to my feelings i am perfectly comfortable to day 
you are comfortable because you are under command 
your command yes 
perhaps i intended you to say so but i meant self command you had 
somehow or other broken bounds yesterday and run away from your 
own management but to day you are got back again and as i cannot 
be always with you it is best to believe your temper under your 
own command rather than mine 
it comes to the same thing i can have no self command without 
a motive you order me whether you speak or not and you can 
be always with me you are always with me 
dating from three of the clock yesterday my perpetual influence 
could not begin earlier or you would not have been so much 
out of humour before 
three of the clock yesterday that is your date i thought i had seen 
you first in february 
your gallantry is really unanswerable but lowering her voice 
nobody speaks except ourselves and it is rather too much to be 
talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people 
i say nothing of which i am ashamed replied he with lively impudence 
i saw you first in february let every body on the hill hear me if 
they can let my accents swell to mickleham on one side and dorking 
on the other i saw you first in february and then whispering 
our companions are excessively stupid what shall we do to rouse them 
any nonsense will serve they shall talk ladies and gentlemen 
i am ordered by miss woodhouse who wherever she is presides 
to say that she desires to know what you are all thinking of 
some laughed and answered good humouredly miss bates said a great deal 
mrs elton swelled at the idea of miss woodhouse s presiding 
mr knightley s answer was the most distinct 
is miss woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are 
all thinking of 
oh no no cried emma laughing as carelessly as she could 
upon no account in the world it is the very last thing i 
would stand the brunt of just now let me hear any thing rather 
than what you are all thinking of i will not say quite all 
there are one or two perhaps glancing at mr weston and harriet 
whose thoughts i might not be afraid of knowing 
it is a sort of thing cried mrs elton emphatically 
which i should not have thought myself privileged to 
inquire into though perhaps as the chaperon of the party 
i never was in any circle exploring parties young ladies married women 
her mutterings were chiefly to her husband and he murmured 
in reply 
very true my love very true exactly so indeed quite unheard of 
but some ladies say any thing better pass it off as a joke 
every body knows what is due to you 
it will not do whispered frank to emma they are most 
of them affronted i will attack them with more address 
ladies and gentlemen i am ordered by miss woodhouse to say that she 
waives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of 
and only requires something very entertaining from each of you 
in a general way here are seven of you besides myself who she 
is pleased to say am very entertaining already and she only 
demands from each of you either one thing very clever be it prose 
or verse original or repeated or two things moderately clever 
or three things very dull indeed and she engages to laugh heartily 
at them all 
oh very well exclaimed miss bates then i need not be uneasy 
three things very dull indeed that will just do for me you know 
i shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever i open 
my mouth shall not i looking round with the most good humoured 
dependence on every body s assent do not you all think i shall 
emma could not resist 
ah madam but there may be a difficulty pardon me but you 
will be limited as to number only three at once 
miss bates deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner did not 
immediately catch her meaning but when it burst on her it could 
not anger though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her 
ah well to be sure yes i see what she means turning to 
mr knightley and i will try to hold my tongue i must make 
myself very disagreeable or she would not have said such a thing 
to an old friend 
i like your plan cried mr weston agreed agreed i will do 
my best i am making a conundrum how will a conundrum reckon 
low i am afraid sir very low answered his son but we shall 
be indulgent especially to any one who leads the way 
no no said emma it will not reckon low a conundrum of 
mr weston s shall clear him and his next neighbour come sir 
pray let me hear it 
i doubt its being very clever myself said mr weston 
it is too much a matter of fact but here it is what two letters 
of the alphabet are there that express perfection 
what two letters express perfection i am sure i do not know 
ah you will never guess you to emma i am certain will 
never guess i will tell you m and a them ma do you understand 
understanding and gratification came together it might be a very 
indifferent piece of wit but emma found a great deal to laugh 
at and enjoy in it and so did frank and harriet it did not seem 
to touch the rest of the party equally some looked very stupid 
about it and mr knightley gravely said 
this explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted and mr weston 
has done very well for himself but he must have knocked up every 
body else perfection should not have come quite so soon 
oh for myself i protest i must be excused said mrs elton 
i really cannot attempt i am not at all fond of the sort of thing 
i had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name which i was not 
at all pleased with i knew who it came from an abominable puppy 
you know who i mean nodding to her husband these kind of things 
are very well at christmas when one is sitting round the fire 
but quite out of place in my opinion when one is exploring 
about the country in summer miss woodhouse must excuse me 
i am not one of those who have witty things at every body s service 
i do not pretend to be a wit i have a great deal of vivacity 
in my own way but i really must be allowed to judge when to speak 
and when to hold my tongue pass us if you please mr churchill 
pass mr e knightley jane and myself we have nothing clever to say 
not one of us 
yes yes pray pass me added her husband with a sort of 
sneering consciousness i have nothing to say that can entertain 
miss woodhouse or any other young lady an old married man 
quite good for nothing shall we walk augusta 
with all my heart i am really tired of exploring so long 
on one spot come jane take my other arm 
jane declined it however and the husband and wife walked off 
happy couple said frank churchill as soon as they were out 
of hearing how well they suit one another very lucky marrying as 
they did upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place they only 
knew each other i think a few weeks in bath peculiarly lucky 
for as to any real knowledge of a person s disposition that bath 
or any public place can give it is all nothing there can be 
no knowledge it is only by seeing women in their own homes 
among their own set just as they always are that you can form 
any just judgment short of that it is all guess and luck 
and will generally be ill luck how many a man has committed himself 
on a short acquaintance and rued it all the rest of his life 
miss fairfax who had seldom spoken before except among her 
own confederates spoke now 
such things do occur undoubtedly she was stopped by a cough 
frank churchill turned towards her to listen 
you were speaking said he gravely she recovered her voice 
i was only going to observe that though such unfortunate circumstances 
do sometimes occur both to men and women i cannot imagine them 
to be very frequent a hasty and imprudent attachment may arise 
but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards i would 
be understood to mean that it can be only weak irresolute characters 
whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance 
who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience 
an oppression for ever 
he made no answer merely looked and bowed in submission and soon 
afterwards said in a lively tone 
well i have so little confidence in my own judgment that whenever 
i marry i hope some body will chuse my wife for me will you 
turning to emma will you chuse a wife for me i am sure i 
should like any body fixed on by you you provide for the family 
you know with a smile at his father find some body for me 
i am in no hurry adopt her educate her 
and make her like myself 
by all means if you can 
very well i undertake the commission you shall have a charming wife 
she must be very lively and have hazle eyes i care for nothing else 
i shall go abroad for a couple of years and when i return 
i shall come to you for my wife remember 
emma was in no danger of forgetting it was a commission to touch every 
favourite feeling would not harriet be the very creature described 
hazle eyes excepted two years more might make her all that he wished 
he might even have harriet in his thoughts at the moment 
who could say referring the education to her seemed to imply it 
now madam said jane to her aunt shall we join mrs elton 
if you please my dear with all my heart i am quite ready 
i was ready to have gone with her but this will do just as well 
we shall soon overtake her there she is no that is somebody else 
that is one of the ladies in the irish car party not at all like her 
well i declare 
they walked off followed in half a minute by mr knightley 
mr weston his son emma and harriet only remained and the young 
man s spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant even emma grew 
tired at last of flattery and merriment and wished herself rather 
walking quietly about with any of the others or sitting almost alone 
and quite unattended to in tranquil observation of the beautiful 
views beneath her the appearance of the servants looking out 
for them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight 
and even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart 
and the solicitude of mrs elton to have her carriage first 
were gladly endured in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was 
to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure 
such another scheme composed of so many ill assorted people 
she hoped never to be betrayed into again 
while waiting for the carriage she found mr knightley by her side 
he looked around as if to see that no one were near and then said 
emma i must once more speak to you as i have been used to do 
a privilege rather endured than allowed perhaps but i must still 
use it i cannot see you acting wrong without a remonstrance 
how could you be so unfeeling to miss bates how could you be so 
insolent in your wit to a woman of her character age and situation 
emma i had not thought it possible 
emma recollected blushed was sorry but tried to laugh it off 
nay how could i help saying what i did nobody could have helped it 
it was not so very bad i dare say she did not understand me 
i assure you she did she felt your full meaning she has talked 
of it since i wish you could have heard how she talked of it 
with what candour and generosity i wish you could have heard her 
honouring your forbearance in being able to pay her such attentions 
as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father 
when her society must be so irksome 
oh cried emma i know there is not a better creature in the world 
but you must allow that what is good and what is ridiculous are 
most unfortunately blended in her 
they are blended said he i acknowledge and were she prosperous 
i could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous 
over the good were she a woman of fortune i would leave every 
harmless absurdity to take its chance i would not quarrel with you 
for any liberties of manner were she your equal in situation 
but emma consider how far this is from being the case she is poor 
she has sunk from the comforts she was born to and if she live 
to old age must probably sink more her situation should secure 
your compassion it was badly done indeed you whom she had known 
from an infant whom she had seen grow up from a period when her 
notice was an honour to have you now in thoughtless spirits 
and the pride of the moment laugh at her humble her and before 
her niece too and before others many of whom certainly some 
would be entirely guided by your treatment of her this is not 
pleasant to you emma and it is very far from pleasant to me 
but i must i will i will tell you truths while i can 
satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel 
and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice 
than you can do now 
while they talked they were advancing towards the carriage 
it was ready and before she could speak again he had handed her in 
he had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted 
and her tongue motionless they were combined only of anger 
against herself mortification and deep concern she had not 
been able to speak and on entering the carriage sunk back 
for a moment overcome then reproaching herself for having taken 
no leave making no acknowledgment parting in apparent sullenness 
she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference 
but it was just too late he had turned away and the horses were 
in motion she continued to look back but in vain and soon 
with what appeared unusual speed they were half way down the hill 
and every thing left far behind she was vexed beyond what could 
have been expressed almost beyond what she could conceal 
never had she felt so agitated mortified grieved at any circumstance 
in her life she was most forcibly struck the truth of this 
representation there was no denying she felt it at her heart 
how could she have been so brutal so cruel to miss bates how could 
she have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued 
and how suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude 
of concurrence of common kindness 
time did not compose her as she reflected more she seemed 
but to feel it more she never had been so depressed happily it 
was not necessary to speak there was only harriet who seemed not 
in spirits herself fagged and very willing to be silent and emma 
felt the tears running down her cheeks almost all the way home 
without being at any trouble to check them extraordinary as they were 
chapter viii 
the wretchedness of a scheme to box hill was in emma s thoughts all 
the evening how it might be considered by the rest of the party 
she could not tell they in their different homes and their different 
ways might be looking back on it with pleasure but in her view it 
was a morning more completely misspent more totally bare of rational 
satisfaction at the time and more to be abhorred in recollection 
than any she had ever passed a whole evening of back gammon with 
her father was felicity to it there indeed lay real pleasure 
for there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty four 
to his comfort and feeling that unmerited as might be the degree 
of his fond affection and confiding esteem she could not in her 
general conduct be open to any severe reproach as a daughter 
she hoped she was not without a heart she hoped no one could 
have said to her how could you be so unfeeling to your father 
i must i will tell you truths while i can miss bates should 
never again no never if attention in future could do away 
the past she might hope to be forgiven she had been often remiss 
her conscience told her so remiss perhaps more in thought 
than fact scornful ungracious but it should be so no more 
in the warmth of true contrition she would call upon her the 
very next morning and it should be the beginning on her side 
of a regular equal kindly intercourse 
she was just as determined when the morrow came and went early 
that nothing might prevent her it was not unlikely she thought 
that she might see mr knightley in her way or perhaps he might 
come in while she were paying her visit she had no objection 
she would not be ashamed of the appearance of the penitence so justly 
and truly hers her eyes were towards donwell as she walked but she 
saw him not 
the ladies were all at home she had never rejoiced at the sound 
before nor ever before entered the passage nor walked up the stairs 
with any wish of giving pleasure but in conferring obligation 
or of deriving it except in subsequent ridicule 
there was a bustle on her approach a good deal of moving and talking 
she heard miss bates s voice something was to be done in a hurry 
the maid looked frightened and awkward hoped she would be pleased 
to wait a moment and then ushered her in too soon the aunt and 
niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room jane she had 
a distinct glimpse of looking extremely ill and before the door 
had shut them out she heard miss bates saying well my dear 
i shall say you are laid down upon the bed and i am sure you are 
ill enough 
poor old mrs bates civil and humble as usual looked as if she 
did not quite understand what was going on 
i am afraid jane is not very well said she but i do not know 
they tell me she is well i dare say my daughter will be here presently 
miss woodhouse i hope you find a chair i wish hetty had not gone 
i am very little able have you a chair madam do you sit where 
you like i am sure she will be here presently 
emma seriously hoped she would she had a moment s fear of miss 
bates keeping away from her but miss bates soon came very happy 
and obliged but emma s conscience told her that there was not the 
same cheerful volubility as before less ease of look and manner 
a very friendly inquiry after miss fairfax she hoped might lead 
the way to a return of old feelings the touch seemed immediate 
ah miss woodhouse how kind you are i suppose you have heard 
and are come to give us joy this does not seem much like joy 
indeed in me twinkling away a tear or two but it will be 
very trying for us to part with her after having had her so long 
and she has a dreadful headache just now writing all the morning 
such long letters you know to be written to colonel campbell 
and mrs dixon my dear said i you will blind yourself 
for tears were in her eyes perpetually one cannot wonder 
one cannot wonder it is a great change and though she is 
amazingly fortunate such a situation i suppose as no young woman 
before ever met with on first going out do not think us ungrateful 
miss woodhouse for such surprising good fortune again dispersing 
her tears but poor dear soul if you were to see what a headache 
she has when one is in great pain you know one cannot feel 
any blessing quite as it may deserve she is as low as possible 
to look at her nobody would think how delighted and happy she 
is to have secured such a situation you will excuse her not 
coming to you she is not able she is gone into her own room 
i want her to lie down upon the bed my dear said i i shall 
say you are laid down upon the bed but however she is not 
she is walking about the room but now that she has written 
her letters she says she shall soon be well she will be extremely 
sorry to miss seeing you miss woodhouse but your kindness will 
excuse her you were kept waiting at the door i was quite ashamed 
but somehow there was a little bustle for it so happened that we 
had not heard the knock and till you were on the stairs we did 
not know any body was coming it is only mrs cole said i 
depend upon it nobody else would come so early well said she 
it must be borne some time or other and it may as well be now 
but then patty came in and said it was you oh said i 
it is miss woodhouse i am sure you will like to see her 
i can see nobody said she and up she got and would go away 
and that was what made us keep you waiting and extremely sorry 
and ashamed we were if you must go my dear said i you must 
and i will say you are laid down upon the bed 
emma was most sincerely interested her heart had been long growing 
kinder towards jane and this picture of her present sufferings acted 
as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion and left her nothing 
but pity and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle 
sensations of the past obliged her to admit that jane might very 
naturally resolve on seeing mrs cole or any other steady friend 
when she might not bear to see herself she spoke as she felt 
with earnest regret and solicitude sincerely wishing that the 
circumstances which she collected from miss bates to be now actually 
determined on might be as much for miss fairfax s advantage 
and comfort as possible it must be a severe trial to them all 
she had understood it was to be delayed till colonel campbell s return 
so very kind replied miss bates but you are always kind 
there was no bearing such an always and to break through her 
dreadful gratitude emma made the direct inquiry of 
where may i ask is miss fairfax going 
to a mrs smallridge charming woman most superior to have 
the charge of her three little girls delightful children 
impossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort 
if we except perhaps mrs suckling s own family and mrs bragge s 
but mrs smallridge is intimate with both and in the very 
same neighbourhood lives only four miles from maple grove 
jane will be only four miles from maple grove 
mrs elton i suppose has been the person to whom miss fairfax owes 
yes our good mrs elton the most indefatigable true friend 
she would not take a denial she would not let jane say no for 
when jane first heard of it it was the day before yesterday 
the very morning we were at donwell when jane first heard of it 
she was quite decided against accepting the offer and for the 
reasons you mention exactly as you say she had made up her mind 
to close with nothing till colonel campbell s return and nothing 
should induce her to enter into any engagement at present and so she 
told mrs elton over and over again and i am sure i had no more 
idea that she would change her mind but that good mrs elton 
whose judgment never fails her saw farther than i did it is not 
every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did 
and refuse to take jane s answer but she positively declared she 
would not write any such denial yesterday as jane wished her 
she would wait and sure enough yesterday evening it was all 
settled that jane should go quite a surprize to me i had not 
the least idea jane took mrs elton aside and told her at once 
that upon thinking over the advantages of mrs smallridge s situation 
she had come to the resolution of accepting it i did not know a word 
of it till it was all settled 
you spent the evening with mrs elton 
yes all of us mrs elton would have us come it was settled so 
upon the hill while we were walking about with mr knightley 
you must all spend your evening with us said she i positively must 
have you all come 
mr knightley was there too was he 
no not mr knightley he declined it from the first and though i 
thought he would come because mrs elton declared she would not let 
him off he did not but my mother and jane and i were all there 
and a very agreeable evening we had such kind friends you know 
miss woodhouse one must always find agreeable though every body 
seemed rather fagged after the morning s party even pleasure 
you know is fatiguing and i cannot say that any of them seemed 
very much to have enjoyed it however i shall always think it 
a very pleasant party and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends 
who included me in it 
miss fairfax i suppose though you were not aware of it had been 
making up her mind the whole day 
i dare say she had 
whenever the time may come it must be unwelcome to her and all 
her friends but i hope her engagement will have every alleviation 
that is possible i mean as to the character and manners of the family 
thank you dear miss woodhouse yes indeed there is every thing 
in the world that can make her happy in it except the sucklings 
and bragges there is not such another nursery establishment 
so liberal and elegant in all mrs elton s acquaintance 
mrs smallridge a most delightful woman a style of living almost 
equal to maple grove and as to the children except the little 
sucklings and little bragges there are not such elegant sweet 
children anywhere jane will be treated with such regard and kindness 
it will be nothing but pleasure a life of pleasure and her salary 
i really cannot venture to name her salary to you miss woodhouse 
even you used as you are to great sums would hardly believe that 
so much could be given to a young person like jane 
ah madam cried emma if other children are at all like what i 
remember to have been myself i should think five times the amount 
of what i have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions 
dearly earned 
you are so noble in your ideas 
and when is miss fairfax to leave you 
very soon very soon indeed that is the worst of it 
within a fortnight mrs smallridge is in a great hurry my poor 
mother does not know how to bear it so then i try to put it out of 
her thoughts and say come madam do not let us think about it any more 
her friends must all be sorry to lose her and will not colonel 
and mrs campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself 
before their return 
yes jane says she is sure they will but yet this is such 
a situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining 
i was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying 
to mrs elton and when mrs elton at the same moment came congratulating 
me upon it it was before tea stay no it could not be before tea 
because we were just going to cards and yet it was before tea 
because i remember thinking oh no now i recollect now i have it 
something happened before tea but not that mr elton was called 
out of the room before tea old john abdy s son wanted to speak 
with him poor old john i have a great regard for him he was clerk 
to my poor father twenty seven years and now poor old man he is 
bed ridden and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints 
i must go and see him to day and so will jane i am sure if she 
gets out at all and poor john s son came to talk to mr elton 
about relief from the parish he is very well to do himself 
you know being head man at the crown ostler and every thing 
of that sort but still he cannot keep his father without some help 
and so when mr elton came back he told us what john ostler 
had been telling him and then it came out about the chaise having 
been sent to randalls to take mr frank churchill to richmond 
that was what happened before tea it was after tea that jane spoke 
to mrs elton 
miss bates would hardly give emma time to say how perfectly 
new this circumstance was to her but as without supposing it 
possible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars 
of mr frank churchill s going she proceeded to give them all 
it was of no consequence 
what mr elton had learned from the ostler on the subject being the 
accumulation of the ostler s own knowledge and the knowledge 
of the servants at randalls was that a messenger had come over 
from richmond soon after the return of the party from box hill 
which messenger however had been no more than was expected 
and that mr churchill had sent his nephew a few lines containing 
upon the whole a tolerable account of mrs churchill and only 
wishing him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early 
but that mr frank churchill having resolved to go home directly 
without waiting at all and his horse seeming to have got a cold 
tom had been sent off immediately for the crown chaise and the 
ostler had stood out and seen it pass by the boy going a good pace 
and driving very steady 
there was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest 
and it caught emma s attention only as it united with the subject 
which already engaged her mind the contrast between mrs churchill s 
importance in the world and jane fairfax s struck her one was 
every thing the other nothing and she sat musing on the difference 
of woman s destiny and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed 
till roused by miss bates s saying 
aye i see what you are thinking of the pianoforte what is to become 
of that very true poor dear jane was talking of it just now 
you must go said she you and i must part you will have no 
business here let it stay however said she give it houseroom 
till colonel campbell comes back i shall talk about it to him 
he will settle for me he will help me out of all my difficulties 
and to this day i do believe she knows not whether it was his 
present or his daughter s 
now emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte and the remembrance 
of all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing 
that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been 
long enough and with a repetition of every thing that she could 
venture to say of the good wishes which she really felt took leave 
chapter ix 
emma s pensive meditations as she walked home were not interrupted 
but on entering the parlour she found those who must rouse her 
mr knightley and harriet had arrived during her absence and were 
sitting with her father mr knightley immediately got up and in a 
manner decidedly graver than usual said 
i would not go away without seeing you but i have no time to spare 
and therefore must now be gone directly i am going to london 
to spend a few days with john and isabella have you any thing to 
send or say besides the love which nobody carries 
nothing at all but is not this a sudden scheme 
yes rather i have been thinking of it some little time 
emma was sure he had not forgiven her he looked unlike himself 
time however she thought would tell him that they ought to be 
friends again while he stood as if meaning to go but not going 
her father began his inquiries 
well my dear and did you get there safely and how did you 
find my worthy old friend and her daughter i dare say they must 
have been very much obliged to you for coming dear emma has been 
to call on mrs and miss bates mr knightley as i told you before 
she is always so attentive to them 
emma s colour was heightened by this unjust praise and with a smile 
and shake of the head which spoke much she looked at mr knightley 
it seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her favour 
as if his eyes received the truth from her s and all that had 
passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured 
he looked at her with a glow of regard she was warmly gratified 
and in another moment still more so by a little movement of 
more than common friendliness on his part he took her hand 
whether she had not herself made the first motion she could not say 
she might perhaps have rather offered it but he took her hand 
pressed it and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips 
when from some fancy or other he suddenly let it go why he should feel 
such a scruple why he should change his mind when it was all but done 
she could not perceive he would have judged better she thought 
if he had not stopped the intention however was indubitable 
and whether it was that his manners had in general so little gallantry 
or however else it happened but she thought nothing became him more 
it was with him of so simple yet so dignified a nature 
she could not but recall the attempt with great satisfaction 
it spoke such perfect amity he left them immediately afterwards 
gone in a moment he always moved with the alertness of a mind which 
could neither be undecided nor dilatory but now he seemed more sudden 
than usual in his disappearance 
emma could not regret her having gone to miss bates but she wished 
she had left her ten minutes earlier it would have been a great 
pleasure to talk over jane fairfax s situation with mr knightley 
neither would she regret that he should be going to brunswick square 
for she knew how much his visit would be enjoyed but it might have 
happened at a better time and to have had longer notice of it 
would have been pleasanter they parted thorough friends however 
she could not be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance 
and his unfinished gallantry it was all done to assure her that she 
had fully recovered his good opinion he had been sitting with them 
half an hour she found it was a pity that she had not come 
back earlier 
in the hope of diverting her father s thoughts from the disagreeableness 
of mr knightley s going to london and going so suddenly 
and going on horseback which she knew would be all very bad 
emma communicated her news of jane fairfax and her dependence 
on the effect was justified it supplied a very useful check 
interested without disturbing him he had long made up his mind to jane 
fairfax s going out as governess and could talk of it cheerfully 
but mr knightley s going to london had been an unexpected blow 
i am very glad indeed my dear to hear she is to be so 
comfortably settled mrs elton is very good natured and agreeable 
and i dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought 
to be i hope it is a dry situation and that her health 
will be taken good care of it ought to be a first object 
as i am sure poor miss taylor s always was with me you know 
my dear she is going to be to this new lady what miss taylor 
was to us and i hope she will be better off in one respect 
and not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long 
the following day brought news from richmond to throw every 
thing else into the background an express arrived at randalls 
to announce the death of mrs churchill though her nephew 
had had no particular reason to hasten back on her account 
she had not lived above six and thirty hours after his return 
a sudden seizure of a different nature from any thing foreboded 
by her general state had carried her off after a short struggle 
the great mrs churchill was no more 
it was felt as such things must be felt every body had a 
degree of gravity and sorrow tenderness towards the departed 
solicitude for the surviving friends and in a reasonable time 
curiosity to know where she would be buried goldsmith tells us 
that when lovely woman stoops to folly she has nothing to do 
but to die and when she stoops to be disagreeable it is equally 
to be recommended as a clearer of ill fame mrs churchill 
after being disliked at least twenty five years was now spoken of 
with compassionate allowances in one point she was fully justified 
she had never been admitted before to be seriously ill the event 
acquitted her of all the fancifulness and all the selfishness 
of imaginary complaints 
poor mrs churchill no doubt she had been suffering a great deal 
more than any body had ever supposed and continual pain would try 
the temper it was a sad event a great shock with all her faults 
what would mr churchill do without her mr churchill s loss 
would be dreadful indeed mr churchill would never get over it 
even mr weston shook his head and looked solemn and said 
ah poor woman who would have thought it and resolved that his 
mourning should be as handsome as possible and his wife sat sighing 
and moralising over her broad hems with a commiseration and good sense 
true and steady how it would affect frank was among the earliest 
thoughts of both it was also a very early speculation with emma 
the character of mrs churchill the grief of her husband her mind 
glanced over them both with awe and compassion and then rested 
with lightened feelings on how frank might be affected by the event 
how benefited how freed she saw in a moment all the possible good 
now an attachment to harriet smith would have nothing to encounter 
mr churchill independent of his wife was feared by nobody 
an easy guidable man to be persuaded into any thing by his nephew 
all that remained to be wished was that the nephew should form 
the attachment as with all her goodwill in the because emma could feel 
no certainty of its being already formed 
harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion with great self command 
what ever she might feel of brighter hope she betrayed nothing emma was 
gratified to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character 
and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance 
they spoke therefore of mrs churchill s death with mutual forbearance 
short letters from frank were received at randalls communicating 
all that was immediately important of their state and plans 
mr churchill was better than could be expected and their 
first removal on the departure of the funeral for yorkshire 
was to be to the house of a very old friend in windsor to whom 
mr churchill had been promising a visit the last ten years 
at present there was nothing to be done for harriet good wishes 
for the future were all that could yet be possible on emma s side 
it was a more pressing concern to shew attention to jane fairfax 
whose prospects were closing while harriet s opened and whose 
engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at highbury who wished 
to shew her kindness and with emma it was grown into a first wish 
she had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness 
and the person whom she had been so many months neglecting was now 
the very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of 
regard or sympathy she wanted to be of use to her wanted to shew 
a value for her society and testify respect and consideration 
she resolved to prevail on her to spend a day at hartfield 
a note was written to urge it the invitation was refused and by 
a verbal message miss fairfax was not well enough to write 
and when mr perry called at hartfield the same morning 
it appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited 
though against her own consent by himself and that she was suffering 
under severe headaches and a nervous fever to a degree which made 
him doubt the possibility of her going to mrs smallridge s at the 
time proposed her health seemed for the moment completely deranged 
appetite quite gone and though there were no absolutely 
alarming symptoms nothing touching the pulmonary complaint 
which was the standing apprehension of the family mr perry was 
uneasy about her he thought she had undertaken more than she 
was equal to and that she felt it so herself though she would 
not own it her spirits seemed overcome her present home 
he could not but observe was unfavourable to a nervous disorder 
confined always to one room he could have wished it otherwise 
and her good aunt though his very old friend he must acknowledge 
to be not the best companion for an invalid of that description 
her care and attention could not be questioned they were in fact 
only too great he very much feared that miss fairfax derived more 
evil than good from them emma listened with the warmest concern 
grieved for her more and more and looked around eager to discover 
some way of being useful to take her be it only an hour 
or two from her aunt to give her change of air and scene 
and quiet rational conversation even for an hour or two 
might do her good and the following morning she wrote again to say 
in the most feeling language she could command that she would 
call for her in the carriage at any hour that jane would name 
mentioning that she had mr perry s decided opinion in favour 
of such exercise for his patient the answer was only in this 
short note 
miss fairfax s compliments and thanks but is quite unequal 
to any exercise 
emma felt that her own note had deserved something better but it 
was impossible to quarrel with words whose tremulous inequality 
shewed indisposition so plainly and she thought only of how she 
might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted 
in spite of the answer therefore she ordered the carriage and drove 
to mrs bates s in the hope that jane would be induced to join her 
but it would not do miss bates came to the carriage door all gratitude 
and agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of 
the greatest service and every thing that message could do was tried 
but all in vain miss bates was obliged to return without success 
jane was quite unpersuadable the mere proposal of going out 
seemed to make her worse emma wished she could have seen her 
and tried her own powers but almost before she could hint the wish 
miss bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on 
no account to let miss woodhouse in indeed the truth was 
that poor dear jane could not bear to see any body any body at all 
mrs elton indeed could not be denied and mrs cole had made 
such a point and mrs perry had said so much but except them 
jane would really see nobody 
emma did not want to be classed with the mrs eltons the mrs perrys 
and the mrs coles who would force themselves anywhere 
neither could she feel any right of preference herself 
she submitted therefore and only questioned miss bates farther 
as to her niece s appetite and diet which she longed to be able 
to assist on that subject poor miss bates was very unhappy 
and very communicative jane would hardly eat any thing 
mr perry recommended nourishing food but every thing they could 
command and never had any body such good neighbours was distasteful 
emma on reaching home called the housekeeper directly to an 
examination of her stores and some arrowroot of very superior quality 
was speedily despatched to miss bates with a most friendly note 
in half an hour the arrowroot was returned with a thousand thanks 
from miss bates but dear jane would not be satisfied without its 
being sent back it was a thing she could not take and moreover 
she insisted on her saying that she was not at all in want of any thing 
when emma afterwards heard that jane fairfax had been seen wandering 
about the meadows at some distance from highbury on the afternoon 
of the very day on which she had under the plea of being unequal 
to any exercise so peremptorily refused to go out with her in 
the carriage she could have no doubt putting every thing together 
that jane was resolved to receive no kindness from her she was sorry 
very sorry her heart was grieved for a state which seemed 
but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits 
inconsistency of action and inequality of powers and it mortified 
her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling or esteemed 
so little worthy as a friend but she had the consolation of knowing 
that her intentions were good and of being able to say to herself 
that could mr knightley have been privy to all her attempts 
of assisting jane fairfax could he even have seen into her heart 
he would not on this occasion have found any thing to reprove 
chapter x 
one morning about ten days after mrs churchill s decease 
emma was called downstairs to mr weston who could not stay 
five minutes and wanted particularly to speak with her 
he met her at the parlour door and hardly asking her how she did 
in the natural key of his voice sunk it immediately to say 
unheard by her father 
can you come to randalls at any time this morning do if it 
be possible mrs weston wants to see you she must see you 
is she unwell 
no no not at all only a little agitated she would have 
ordered the carriage and come to you but she must see you alone 
and that you know nodding towards her father humph can you come 
certainly this moment if you please it is impossible to 
refuse what you ask in such a way but what can be the matter 
is she really not ill 
depend upon me but ask no more questions you will know it 
all in time the most unaccountable business but hush hush 
to guess what all this meant was impossible even for emma 
something really important seemed announced by his looks 
but as her friend was well she endeavoured not to be uneasy 
and settling it with her father that she would take her walk now 
she and mr weston were soon out of the house together and on 
their way at a quick pace for randalls 
now said emma when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates 
now mr weston do let me know what has happened 
no no he gravely replied do not ask me i promised my wife 
to leave it all to her she will break it to you better than i can 
do not be impatient emma it will all come out too soon 
break it to me cried emma standing still with terror 
good god mr weston tell me at once something has happened 
in brunswick square i know it has tell me i charge you tell 
me this moment what it is 
no indeed you are mistaken 
mr weston do not trifle with me consider how many of my dearest 
friends are now in brunswick square which of them is it 
i charge you by all that is sacred not to attempt concealment 
upon my word emma 
your word why not your honour why not say upon your honour 
that it has nothing to do with any of them good heavens what can 
be to be broke to me that does not relate to one of that family 
upon my honour said he very seriously it does not it is not 
in the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name 
of knightley 
emma s courage returned and she walked on 
i was wrong he continued in talking of its being broke to you 
i should not have used the expression in fact it does not concern you 
it concerns only myself that is we hope humph in short 
my dear emma there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it 
i do not say that it is not a disagreeable business but things might 
be much worse if we walk fast we shall soon be at randalls 
emma found that she must wait and now it required little effort 
she asked no more questions therefore merely employed her own fancy 
and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some 
money concern something just come to light of a disagreeable 
nature in the circumstances of the family something which the late 
event at richmond had brought forward her fancy was very active 
half a dozen natural children perhaps and poor frank cut off 
this though very undesirable would be no matter of agony to her 
it inspired little more than an animating curiosity 
who is that gentleman on horseback said she as they proceeded 
speaking more to assist mr weston in keeping his secret than with 
any other view 
i do not know one of the otways not frank it is not frank 
i assure you you will not see him he is half way to windsor 
by this time 
has your son been with you then 
oh yes did not you know well well never mind 
for a moment he was silent and then added in a tone much more 
guarded and demure 
yes frank came over this morning just to ask us how we did 
they hurried on and were speedily at randalls well my dear 
said he as they entered the room i have brought her and now 
i hope you will soon be better i shall leave you together 
there is no use in delay i shall not be far off if you want me 
and emma distinctly heard him add in a lower tone before he 
quitted the room i have been as good as my word she has not the 
least idea 
mrs weston was looking so ill and had an air of so much perturbation 
that emma s uneasiness increased and the moment they were alone 
she eagerly said 
what is it my dear friend something of a very unpleasant nature 
i find has occurred do let me know directly what it is 
i have been walking all this way in complete suspense we both 
abhor suspense do not let mine continue longer it will do you 
good to speak of your distress whatever it may be 
have you indeed no idea said mrs weston in a trembling voice 
cannot you my dear emma cannot you form a guess as to what you 
are to hear 
so far as that it relates to mr frank churchill i do guess 
you are right it does relate to him and i will tell you directly 
resuming her work and seeming resolved against looking up 
he has been here this very morning on a most extraordinary errand 
it is impossible to express our surprize he came to speak to his 
father on a subject to announce an attachment 
she stopped to breathe emma thought first of herself and then 
of harriet 
more than an attachment indeed resumed mrs weston an engagement 
a positive engagement what will you say emma what will any 
body say when it is known that frank churchill and miss fairfax 
are engaged nay that they have been long engaged 
emma even jumped with surprize and horror struck exclaimed 
jane fairfax good god you are not serious you do not mean it 
you may well be amazed returned mrs weston still averting her eyes 
and talking on with eagerness that emma might have time to recover 
you may well be amazed but it is even so there has been a solemn 
engagement between them ever since october formed at weymouth 
and kept a secret from every body not a creature knowing it 
but themselves neither the campbells nor her family nor his 
it is so wonderful that though perfectly convinced of the fact 
it is yet almost incredible to myself i can hardly believe it 
i thought i knew him 
emma scarcely heard what was said her mind was divided between 
two ideas her own former conversations with him about miss fairfax 
and poor harriet and for some time she could only exclaim 
and require confirmation repeated confirmation 
well said she at last trying to recover herself this is a 
circumstance which i must think of at least half a day before i 
can at all comprehend it what engaged to her all the winter 
before either of them came to highbury 
engaged since october secretly engaged it has hurt me 
emma very much it has hurt his father equally some part 
of his conduct we cannot excuse 
emma pondered a moment and then replied i will not pretend 
not to understand you and to give you all the relief in my power 
be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me 
as you are apprehensive of 
mrs weston looked up afraid to believe but emma s countenance 
was as steady as her words 
that you may have less difficulty in believing this boast of my 
present perfect indifference she continued i will farther tell you 
that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance 
when i did like him when i was very much disposed to be 
attached to him nay was attached and how it came to cease 
is perhaps the wonder fortunately however it did cease 
i have really for some time past for at least these three months 
cared nothing about him you may believe me mrs weston 
this is the simple truth 
mrs weston kissed her with tears of joy and when she could 
find utterance assured her that this protestation had done 
her more good than any thing else in the world could do 
mr weston will be almost as much relieved as myself said she 
on this point we have been wretched it was our darling wish that you 
might be attached to each other and we were persuaded that it was so 
imagine what we have been feeling on your account 
i have escaped and that i should escape may be a matter of 
grateful wonder to you and myself but this does not acquit him 
mrs weston and i must say that i think him greatly to blame 
what right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged 
and with manners so very disengaged what right had he to endeavour 
to please as he certainly did to distinguish any one young woman with 
persevering attention as he certainly did while he really belonged 
to another how could he tell what mischief he might be doing 
how could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him 
very wrong very wrong indeed 
from something that he said my dear emma i rather imagine 
and how could she bear such behaviour composure with a witness 
to look on while repeated attentions were offering to another woman 
before her face and not resent it that is a degree of placidity 
which i can neither comprehend nor respect 
there were misunderstandings between them emma he said 
so expressly he had not time to enter into much explanation 
he was here only a quarter of an hour and in a state of agitation 
which did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay 
but that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said 
the present crisis indeed seemed to be brought on by them 
and those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the 
impropriety of his conduct 
impropriety oh mrs weston it is too calm a censure 
much much beyond impropriety it has sunk him i cannot say how 
it has sunk him in my opinion so unlike what a man should be 
none of that upright integrity that strict adherence to truth 
and principle that disdain of trick and littleness which a man 
should display in every transaction of his life 
nay dear emma now i must take his part for though he has been 
wrong in this instance i have known him long enough to answer 
for his having many very many good qualities and 
good god cried emma not attending to her mrs smallridge too 
jane actually on the point of going as governess what could he 
mean by such horrible indelicacy to suffer her to engage herself 
to suffer her even to think of such a measure 
he knew nothing about it emma on this article i can fully 
acquit him it was a private resolution of hers not communicated 
to him or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction 
till yesterday i know he said he was in the dark as to her plans 
they burst on him i do not know how but by some letter or message 
and it was the discovery of what she was doing of this very project 
of hers which determined him to come forward at once own it 
all to his uncle throw himself on his kindness and in short 
put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been 
carrying on so long 
emma began to listen better 
i am to hear from him soon continued mrs weston he told me 
at parting that he should soon write and he spoke in a manner which 
seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now 
let us wait therefore for this letter it may bring many extenuations 
it may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are 
not to be understood do not let us be severe do not let us be in 
a hurry to condemn him let us have patience i must love him 
and now that i am satisfied on one point the one material point 
i am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well and ready 
to hope that it may they must both have suffered a great deal 
under such a system of secresy and concealment 
his sufferings replied emma dryly do not appear to have done 
him much harm well and how did mr churchill take it 
most favourably for his nephew gave his consent with scarcely 
a difficulty conceive what the events of a week have done 
in that family while poor mrs churchill lived i suppose there 
could not have been a hope a chance a possibility but scarcely 
are her remains at rest in the family vault than her husband is 
persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required 
what a blessing it is when undue influence does not survive the grave 
he gave his consent with very little persuasion 
ah thought emma he would have done as much for harriet 
this was settled last night and frank was off with the light 
this morning he stopped at highbury at the bates s i fancy 
some time and then came on hither but was in such a hurry to get 
back to his uncle to whom he is just now more necessary than ever 
that as i tell you he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour 
he was very much agitated very much indeed to a degree that made 
him appear quite a different creature from any thing i had ever seen 
him before in addition to all the rest there had been the shock of 
finding her so very unwell which he had had no previous suspicion of 
and there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal 
and do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on 
with such perfect secresy the campbells the dixons did none 
of them know of the engagement 
emma could not speak the name of dixon without a little blush 
none not one he positively said that it had been known to no 
being in the world but their two selves 
well said emma i suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled 
to the idea and i wish them very happy but i shall always 
think it a very abominable sort of proceeding what has it been 
but a system of hypocrisy and deceit espionage and treachery 
to come among us with professions of openness and simplicity 
and such a league in secret to judge us all here have we been 
the whole winter and spring completely duped fancying ourselves 
all on an equal footing of truth and honour with two people in the 
midst of us who may have been carrying round comparing and sitting 
in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both 
to hear they must take the consequence if they have heard each 
other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable 
i am quite easy on that head replied mrs weston i am 
very sure that i never said any thing of either to the other 
which both might not have heard 
you are in luck your only blunder was confined to my ear 
when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady 
true but as i have always had a thoroughly good opinion of miss 
fairfax i never could under any blunder have spoken ill of her 
and as to speaking ill of him there i must have been safe 
at this moment mr weston appeared at a little distance from the window 
evidently on the watch his wife gave him a look which invited 
him in and while he was coming round added now dearest emma 
let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his 
heart at ease and incline him to be satisfied with the match 
let us make the best of it and indeed almost every thing may 
be fairly said in her favour it is not a connexion to gratify 
but if mr churchill does not feel that why should we and it 
may be a very fortunate circumstance for him for frank i mean 
that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness 
of character and good judgment as i have always given her credit for 
and still am disposed to give her credit for in spite of this 
one great deviation from the strict rule of right and how much 
may be said in her situation for even that error 
much indeed cried emma feelingly if a woman can ever 
be excused for thinking only of herself it is in a situation 
like jane fairfax s of such one may almost say that the 
world is not their s nor the world s law 
she met mr weston on his entrance with a smiling countenance 
exclaiming 
a very pretty trick you have been playing me upon my word 
this was a device i suppose to sport with my curiosity 
and exercise my talent of guessing but you really frightened me 
i thought you had lost half your property at least and here 
instead of its being a matter of condolence it turns out to be one 
of congratulation i congratulate you mr weston with all my heart 
on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished 
young women in england for your daughter 
a glance or two between him and his wife convinced him that all was 
as right as this speech proclaimed and its happy effect on his spirits 
was immediate his air and voice recovered their usual briskness 
he shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand and entered 
on the subject in a manner to prove that he now only wanted 
time and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing 
his companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence 
or smooth objections and by the time they had talked it all 
over together and he had talked it all over again with emma 
in their walk back to hartfield he was become perfectly reconciled 
and not far from thinking it the very best thing that frank could 
possibly have done 
chapter xi 
harriet poor harriet those were the words in them lay the 
tormenting ideas which emma could not get rid of and which constituted 
the real misery of the business to her frank churchill had behaved 
very ill by herself very ill in many ways but it was not so much 
his behaviour as her own which made her so angry with him 
it was the scrape which he had drawn her into on harriet s account 
that gave the deepest hue to his offence poor harriet to be a second 
time the dupe of her misconceptions and flattery mr knightley 
had spoken prophetically when he once said emma you have been 
no friend to harriet smith she was afraid she had done her nothing 
but disservice it was true that she had not to charge herself 
in this instance as in the former with being the sole and original 
author of the mischief with having suggested such feelings as might 
otherwise never have entered harriet s imagination for harriet 
had acknowledged her admiration and preference of frank churchill 
before she had ever given her a hint on the subject but she felt 
completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed 
she might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments 
her influence would have been enough and now she was very conscious 
that she ought to have prevented them she felt that she had been 
risking her friend s happiness on most insufficient grounds 
common sense would have directed her to tell harriet that she 
must not allow herself to think of him and that there were five 
hundred chances to one against his ever caring for her but with 
common sense she added i am afraid i have had little to do 
she was extremely angry with herself if she could not have been 
angry with frank churchill too it would have been dreadful 
as for jane fairfax she might at least relieve her feelings 
from any present solicitude on her account harriet would 
be anxiety enough she need no longer be unhappy about jane 
whose troubles and whose ill health having of course the same origin 
must be equally under cure her days of insignificance and evil 
were over she would soon be well and happy and prosperous 
emma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted 
this discovery laid many smaller matters open no doubt it had been 
from jealousy in jane s eyes she had been a rival and well might 
any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed 
an airing in the hartfield carriage would have been the rack 
and arrowroot from the hartfield storeroom must have been poison 
she understood it all and as far as her mind could disengage itself 
from the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings she acknowledged 
that jane fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond 
her desert but poor harriet was such an engrossing charge 
there was little sympathy to be spared for any body else 
emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be 
more severe than the first considering the very superior claims 
of the object it ought and judging by its apparently stronger effect 
on harriet s mind producing reserve and self command it would 
she must communicate the painful truth however and as soon 
as possible an injunction of secresy had been among mr weston s 
parting words for the present the whole affair was to be 
completely a secret mr churchill had made a point of it 
as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost 
and every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum 
emma had promised but still harriet must be excepted it was her 
superior duty 
in spite of her vexation she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous 
that she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to 
perform by harriet which mrs weston had just gone through by herself 
the intelligence which had been so anxiously announced to her 
she was now to be anxiously announcing to another her heart beat 
quick on hearing harriet s footstep and voice so she supposed 
had poor mrs weston felt when she was approaching randalls 
could the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance 
but of that unfortunately there could be no chance 
well miss woodhouse cried harriet coming eagerly into the room 
is not this the oddest news that ever was 
what news do you mean replied emma unable to guess by look 
or voice whether harriet could indeed have received any hint 
about jane fairfax did you ever hear any thing so strange 
oh you need not be afraid of owning it to me for mr weston has 
told me himself i met him just now he told me it was to be 
a great secret and therefore i should not think of mentioning 
it to any body but you but he said you knew it 
what did mr weston tell you said emma still perplexed 
oh he told me all about it that jane fairfax and mr frank 
churchill are to be married and that they have been privately 
engaged to one another this long while how very odd 
it was indeed so odd harriet s behaviour was so extremely odd 
that emma did not know how to understand it her character appeared 
absolutely changed she seemed to propose shewing no agitation 
or disappointment or peculiar concern in the discovery emma looked 
at her quite unable to speak 
had you any idea cried harriet of his being in love 
with her you perhaps might you blushing as she spoke 
who can see into every body s heart but nobody else 
upon my word said emma i begin to doubt my having any such talent 
can you seriously ask me harriet whether i imagined him attached 
to another woman at the very time that i was tacitly if not openly 
encouraging you to give way to your own feelings i never had 
the slightest suspicion till within the last hour of mr frank 
churchill s having the least regard for jane fairfax you may be 
very sure that if i had i should have cautioned you accordingly 
me cried harriet colouring and astonished why should you 
caution me you do not think i care about mr frank churchill 
i am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject 
replied emma smiling but you do not mean to deny that there 
was a time and not very distant either when you gave me reason 
to understand that you did care about him 
him never never dear miss woodhouse how could you so mistake me 
turning away distressed 
harriet cried emma after a moment s pause what do you mean 
good heaven what do you mean mistake you am i to suppose then 
she could not speak another word her voice was lost and she 
sat down waiting in great terror till harriet should answer 
harriet who was standing at some distance and with face turned 
from her did not immediately say any thing and when she did speak 
it was in a voice nearly as agitated as emma s 
i should not have thought it possible she began that you 
could have misunderstood me i know we agreed never to name him 
but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else 
i should not have thought it possible that i could be supposed 
to mean any other person mr frank churchill indeed i do not 
know who would ever look at him in the company of the other 
i hope i have a better taste than to think of mr frank churchill 
who is like nobody by his side and that you should have been 
so mistaken is amazing i am sure but for believing that you 
entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment 
i should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost 
to dare to think of him at first if you had not told me 
that more wonderful things had happened that there had been 
matches of greater disparity those were your very words 
i should not have dared to give way to i should not have thought 
it possible but if you who had been always acquainted with him 
harriet cried emma collecting herself resolutely let us 
understand each other now without the possibility of farther mistake 
are you speaking of mr knightley 
to be sure i am i never could have an idea of any body else 
and so i thought you knew when we talked about him it was as clear 
as possible 
not quite returned emma with forced calmness for all that 
you then said appeared to me to relate to a different person 
i could almost assert that you had named mr frank churchill 
i am sure the service mr frank churchill had rendered you 
in protecting you from the gipsies was spoken of 
oh miss woodhouse how you do forget 
my dear harriet i perfectly remember the substance of what i 
said on the occasion i told you that i did not wonder at 
your attachment that considering the service he had rendered you 
it was extremely natural and you agreed to it expressing yourself 
very warmly as to your sense of that service and mentioning 
even what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward 
to your rescue the impression of it is strong on my memory 
oh dear cried harriet now i recollect what you mean but i 
was thinking of something very different at the time it was not 
the gipsies it was not mr frank churchill that i meant no with 
some elevation i was thinking of a much more precious circumstance 
of mr knightley s coming and asking me to dance when mr elton 
would not stand up with me and when there was no other partner in 
the room that was the kind action that was the noble benevolence 
and generosity that was the service which made me begin to feel 
how superior he was to every other being upon earth 
good god cried emma this has been a most unfortunate 
most deplorable mistake what is to be done 
you would not have encouraged me then if you had understood me 
at least however i cannot be worse off than i should have been 
if the other had been the person and now it is possible 
she paused a few moments emma could not speak 
i do not wonder miss woodhouse she resumed that you should feel 
a great difference between the two as to me or as to any body 
you must think one five hundred million times more above me than 
the other but i hope miss woodhouse that supposing that if 
strange as it may appear but you know they were your own words 
that more wonderful things had happened matches of greater disparity 
had taken place than between mr frank churchill and me and therefore 
it seems as if such a thing even as this may have occurred before 
and if i should be so fortunate beyond expression as to 
if mr knightley should really if he does not mind the disparity 
i hope dear miss woodhouse you will not set yourself against it 
and try to put difficulties in the way but you are too good for that 
i am sure 
harriet was standing at one of the windows emma turned round 
to look at her in consternation and hastily said 
have you any idea of mr knightley s returning your affection 
yes replied harriet modestly but not fearfully i must say 
that i have 
emma s eyes were instantly withdrawn and she sat silently meditating 
in a fixed attitude for a few minutes a few minutes were sufficient 
for making her acquainted with her own heart a mind like hers 
once opening to suspicion made rapid progress she touched 
she admitted she acknowledged the whole truth why was it 
so much worse that harriet should be in love with mr knightley 
than with frank churchill why was the evil so dreadfully increased 
by harriet s having some hope of a return it darted through her 
with the speed of an arrow that mr knightley must marry no one 
but herself 
her own conduct as well as her own heart was before her in the 
same few minutes she saw it all with a clearness which had 
never blessed her before how improperly had she been acting 
by harriet how inconsiderate how indelicate how irrational 
how unfeeling had been her conduct what blindness what madness 
had led her on it struck her with dreadful force and she 
was ready to give it every bad name in the world some portion 
of respect for herself however in spite of all these demerits 
some concern for her own appearance and a strong sense of justice 
by harriet there would be no need of compassion to the girl 
who believed herself loved by mr knightley but justice required 
that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now 
gave emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness 
with even apparent kindness for her own advantage indeed it was fit 
that the utmost extent of harriet s hopes should be enquired into 
and harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest 
which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained or to deserve 
to be slighted by the person whose counsels had never led her right 
rousing from reflection therefore and subduing her emotion 
she turned to harriet again and in a more inviting accent renewed 
the conversation for as to the subject which had first introduced it 
the wonderful story of jane fairfax that was quite sunk and lost 
neither of them thought but of mr knightley and themselves 
harriet who had been standing in no unhappy reverie was yet very glad 
to be called from it by the now encouraging manner of such a judge 
and such a friend as miss woodhouse and only wanted invitation 
to give the history of her hopes with great though trembling 
delight emma s tremblings as she asked and as she listened 
were better concealed than harriet s but they were not less 
her voice was not unsteady but her mind was in all the perturbation 
that such a development of self such a burst of threatening evil 
such a confusion of sudden and perplexing emotions must create 
she listened with much inward suffering but with great outward 
patience to harriet s detail methodical or well arranged 
or very well delivered it could not be expected to be 
but it contained when separated from all the feebleness and 
tautology of the narration a substance to sink her spirit 
especially with the corroborating circumstances which her own memory 
brought in favour of mr knightley s most improved opinion of harriet 
harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since 
those two decisive dances emma knew that he had on that occasion 
found her much superior to his expectation from that evening 
or at least from the time of miss woodhouse s encouraging her 
to think of him harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking 
to her much more than he had been used to do and of his having 
indeed quite a different manner towards her a manner of kindness 
and sweetness latterly she had been more and more aware of it 
when they had been all walking together he had so often come and walked 
by her and talked so very delightfully he seemed to want to be 
acquainted with her emma knew it to have been very much the case 
she had often observed the change to almost the same extent 
harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him 
and emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had 
known of his opinion of harriet he praised her for being without 
art or affectation for having simple honest generous feelings 
she knew that he saw such recommendations in harriet he had dwelt 
on them to her more than once much that lived in harriet s memory 
many little particulars of the notice she had received from him a look 
a speech a removal from one chair to another a compliment implied 
a preference inferred had been unnoticed because unsuspected 
by emma circumstances that might swell to half an hour s relation 
and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them had passed 
undiscerned by her who now heard them but the two latest occurrences 
to be mentioned the two of strongest promise to harriet were not 
without some degree of witness from emma herself the first 
was his walking with her apart from the others in the lime walk 
at donwell where they had been walking some time before emma came 
and he had taken pains as she was convinced to draw her from 
the rest to himself and at first he had talked to her in a more 
particular way than he had ever done before in a very particular 
way indeed harriet could not recall it without a blush he seemed 
to be almost asking her whether her affections were engaged 
but as soon as she miss woodhouse appeared likely to join them 
he changed the subject and began talking about farming 
the second was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour 
before emma came back from her visit the very last morning of his 
being at hartfield though when he first came in he had said 
that he could not stay five minutes and his having told her 
during their conversation that though he must go to london 
it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all 
which was much more as emma felt than he had acknowledged to her 
the superior degree of confidence towards harriet which this one 
article marked gave her severe pain 
on the subject of the first of the two circumstances she did 
after a little reflection venture the following question 
might he not is not it possible that when enquiring as you thought 
into the state of your affections he might be alluding to mr martin 
he might have mr martin s interest in view but harriet rejected 
the suspicion with spirit 
mr martin no indeed there was not a hint of mr martin 
i hope i know better now than to care for mr martin or to be 
suspected of it 
when harriet had closed her evidence she appealed to her dear 
miss woodhouse to say whether she had not good ground for hope 
i never should have presumed to think of it at first said she 
but for you you told me to observe him carefully and let 
his behaviour be the rule of mine and so i have but now i seem 
to feel that i may deserve him and that if he does chuse me 
it will not be any thing so very wonderful 
the bitter feelings occasioned by this speech the many bitter 
feelings made the utmost exertion necessary on emma s side 
to enable her to say on reply 
harriet i will only venture to declare that mr knightley is 
the last man in the world who would intentionally give any woman 
the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does 
harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory 
and emma was only saved from raptures and fondness which at 
that moment would have been dreadful penance by the sound of her 
father s footsteps he was coming through the hall harriet was 
too much agitated to encounter him she could not compose herself 
mr woodhouse would be alarmed she had better go with most ready 
encouragement from her friend therefore she passed off through 
another door and the moment she was gone this was the spontaneous 
burst of emma s feelings oh god that i had never seen her 
the rest of the day the following night were hardly enough 
for her thoughts she was bewildered amidst the confusion 
of all that had rushed on her within the last few hours 
every moment had brought a fresh surprize and every surprize 
must be matter of humiliation to her how to understand it all 
how to understand the deceptions she had been thus practising 
on herself and living under the blunders the blindness of her 
own head and heart she sat still she walked about she tried her 
own room she tried the shrubbery in every place every posture 
she perceived that she had acted most weakly that she had been imposed 
on by others in a most mortifying degree that she had been imposing 
on herself in a degree yet more mortifying that she was wretched 
and should probably find this day but the beginning of wretchedness 
to understand thoroughly understand her own heart was the 
first endeavour to that point went every leisure moment which her 
father s claims on her allowed and every moment of involuntary 
absence of mind 
how long had mr knightley been so dear to her as every feeling 
declared him now to be when had his influence such influence begun 
when had he succeeded to that place in her affection which frank 
churchill had once for a short period occupied she looked back 
she compared the two compared them as they had always stood in 
her estimation from the time of the latter s becoming known to her 
and as they must at any time have been compared by her had it 
oh had it by any blessed felicity occurred to her to institute 
the comparison she saw that there never had been a time when she 
did not consider mr knightley as infinitely the superior or when 
his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear she saw 
that in persuading herself in fancying in acting to the contrary 
she had been entirely under a delusion totally ignorant of her 
own heart and in short that she had never really cared for frank 
churchill at all 
this was the conclusion of the first series of reflection 
this was the knowledge of herself on the first question of inquiry 
which she reached and without being long in reaching it 
she was most sorrowfully indignant ashamed of every sensation 
but the one revealed to her her affection for mr knightley 
every other part of her mind was disgusting 
with insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every 
body s feelings with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every 
body s destiny she was proved to have been universally mistaken 
and she had not quite done nothing for she had done mischief 
she had brought evil on harriet on herself and she too much feared 
on mr knightley were this most unequal of all connexions to 
take place on her must rest all the reproach of having given it 
a beginning for his attachment she must believe to be produced only 
by a consciousness of harriet s and even were this not the case 
he would never have known harriet at all but for her folly 
mr knightley and harriet smith it was a union to distance every 
wonder of the kind the attachment of frank churchill and jane 
fairfax became commonplace threadbare stale in the comparison 
exciting no surprize presenting no disparity affording nothing 
to be said or thought mr knightley and harriet smith such an 
elevation on her side such a debasement on his it was horrible 
to emma to think how it must sink him in the general opinion 
to foresee the smiles the sneers the merriment it would prompt at 
his expense the mortification and disdain of his brother the thousand 
inconveniences to himself could it be no it was impossible 
and yet it was far very far from impossible was it a new 
circumstance for a man of first rate abilities to be captivated by 
very inferior powers was it new for one perhaps too busy to seek 
to be the prize of a girl who would seek him was it new for any 
thing in this world to be unequal inconsistent incongruous or for 
chance and circumstance as second causes to direct the human fate 
oh had she never brought harriet forward had she left her where 
she ought and where he had told her she ought had she not 
with a folly which no tongue could express prevented her marrying 
the unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy 
and respectable in the line of life to which she ought to belong 
all would have been safe none of this dreadful sequel would have been 
how harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise 
her thoughts to mr knightley how she could dare to fancy 
herself the chosen of such a man till actually assured of it 
but harriet was less humble had fewer scruples than formerly 
her inferiority whether of mind or situation seemed little felt 
she had seemed more sensible of mr elton s being to stoop 
in marrying her than she now seemed of mr knightley s 
alas was not that her own doing too who had been at pains to give 
harriet notions of self consequence but herself who but herself 
had taught her that she was to elevate herself if possible 
and that her claims were great to a high worldly establishment 
if harriet from being humble were grown vain it was her doing too 
chapter xii 
till now that she was threatened with its loss emma had never known 
how much of her happiness depended on being first with mr knightley 
first in interest and affection satisfied that it was so 
and feeling it her due she had enjoyed it without reflection 
and only in the dread of being supplanted found how inexpressibly 
important it had been long very long she felt she had been first 
for having no female connexions of his own there had been 
only isabella whose claims could be compared with hers and she 
had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed isabella 
she had herself been first with him for many years past 
she had not deserved it she had often been negligent or perverse 
slighting his advice or even wilfully opposing him insensible of 
half his merits and quarrelling with him because he would not 
acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own but still 
from family attachment and habit and thorough excellence of mind 
he had loved her and watched over her from a girl with an endeavour 
to improve her and an anxiety for her doing right which no 
other creature had at all shared in spite of all her faults 
she knew she was dear to him might she not say very dear 
when the suggestions of hope however which must follow here 
presented themselves she could not presume to indulge them 
harriet smith might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly 
exclusively passionately loved by mr knightley she could not 
she could not flatter herself with any idea of blindness in his attachment 
to her she had received a very recent proof of its impartiality 
how shocked had he been by her behaviour to miss bates how directly 
how strongly had he expressed himself to her on the subject not too 
strongly for the offence but far far too strongly to issue from 
any feeling softer than upright justice and clear sighted goodwill 
she had no hope nothing to deserve the name of hope that he could 
have that sort of affection for herself which was now in question 
but there was a hope at times a slight one at times much stronger 
that harriet might have deceived herself and be overrating his 
regard for her wish it she must for his sake be the consequence 
nothing to herself but his remaining single all his life 
could she be secure of that indeed of his never marrying at all 
she believed she should be perfectly satisfied let him but continue 
the same mr knightley to her and her father the same mr knightley 
to all the world let donwell and hartfield lose none of their 
precious intercourse of friendship and confidence and her peace 
would be fully secured marriage in fact would not do for her 
it would be incompatible with what she owed to her father and with 
what she felt for him nothing should separate her from her father 
she would not marry even if she were asked by mr knightley 
it must be her ardent wish that harriet might be disappointed 
and she hoped that when able to see them together again she might at 
least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were she should 
see them henceforward with the closest observance and wretchedly 
as she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching 
she did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here 
he was expected back every day the power of observation would be 
soon given frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in 
one course in the meanwhile she resolved against seeing harriet 
it would do neither of them good it would do the subject no good 
to be talking of it farther she was resolved not to be convinced 
as long as she could doubt and yet had no authority for opposing 
harriet s confidence to talk would be only to irritate she wrote 
to her therefore kindly but decisively to beg that she would not 
at present come to hartfield acknowledging it to be her conviction 
that all farther confidential discussion of one topic had better 
be avoided and hoping that if a few days were allowed to pass before 
they met again except in the company of others she objected only 
to a tete a tete they might be able to act as if they had forgotten 
the conversation of yesterday harriet submitted and approved 
and was grateful 
this point was just arranged when a visitor arrived to tear emma s 
thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them 
sleeping or waking the last twenty four hours mrs weston who had 
been calling on her daughter in law elect and took hartfield in her 
way home almost as much in duty to emma as in pleasure to herself 
to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview 
mr weston had accompanied her to mrs bates s and gone through his 
share of this essential attention most handsomely but she having 
then induced miss fairfax to join her in an airing was now returned 
with much more to say and much more to say with satisfaction 
than a quarter of an hour spent in mrs bates s parlour with all 
the encumbrance of awkward feelings could have afforded 
a little curiosity emma had and she made the most of it while 
her friend related mrs weston had set off to pay the visit 
in a good deal of agitation herself and in the first place had 
wished not to go at all at present to be allowed merely to write 
to miss fairfax instead and to defer this ceremonious call till 
a little time had passed and mr churchill could be reconciled 
to the engagement s becoming known as considering every thing 
she thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports 
but mr weston had thought differently he was extremely anxious 
to shew his approbation to miss fairfax and her family and did not 
conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it or if it were 
that it would be of any consequence for such things he observed 
always got about emma smiled and felt that mr weston had 
very good reason for saying so they had gone in short and very 
great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady 
she had hardly been able to speak a word and every look and action 
had shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness the quiet 
heart felt satisfaction of the old lady and the rapturous delight 
of her daughter who proved even too joyous to talk as usual 
had been a gratifying yet almost an affecting scene they were 
both so truly respectable in their happiness so disinterested 
in every sensation thought so much of jane so much of every body 
and so little of themselves that every kindly feeling was at work 
for them miss fairfax s recent illness had offered a fair plea 
for mrs weston to invite her to an airing she had drawn back and 
declined at first but on being pressed had yielded and in the 
course of their drive mrs weston had by gentle encouragement 
overcome so much of her embarrassment as to bring her to converse 
on the important subject apologies for her seemingly ungracious 
silence in their first reception and the warmest expressions of the 
gratitude she was always feeling towards herself and mr weston 
must necessarily open the because but when these effusions were put by 
they had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state 
of the engagement mrs weston was convinced that such conversation 
must be the greatest relief to her companion pent up within her own 
mind as every thing had so long been and was very much pleased 
with all that she had said on the subject 
on the misery of what she had suffered during the concealment 
of so many months continued mrs weston she was energetic 
this was one of her expressions i will not say that since i 
entered into the engagement i have not had some happy moments but i 
can say that i have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour 
and the quivering lip emma which uttered it was an attestation 
that i felt at my heart 
poor girl said emma she thinks herself wrong then for having 
consented to a private engagement 
wrong no one i believe can blame her more than she is disposed 
to blame herself the consequence said she has been a state 
of perpetual suffering to me and so it ought but after all the 
punishment that misconduct can bring it is still not less misconduct 
pain is no expiation i never can be blameless i have been acting 
contrary to all my sense of right and the fortunate turn that every 
thing has taken and the kindness i am now receiving is what my 
conscience tells me ought not to be do not imagine madam 
she continued that i was taught wrong do not let any reflection 
fall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought 
me up the error has been all my own and i do assure you that 
with all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to give 
i shall yet dread making the story known to colonel campbell 
poor girl said emma again she loves him then excessively 
i suppose it must have been from attachment only that she could 
be led to form the engagement her affection must have overpowered 
her judgment 
yes i have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him 
i am afraid returned emma sighing that i must often have 
contributed to make her unhappy 
on your side my love it was very innocently done but she 
probably had something of that in her thoughts when alluding 
to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before 
one natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in 
she said was that of making her unreasonable the consciousness 
of having done amiss had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes 
and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been 
that had been hard for him to bear i did not make the allowances 
said she which i ought to have done for his temper and spirits 
his delightful spirits and that gaiety that playfulness 
of disposition which under any other circumstances would i am sure 
have been as constantly bewitching to me as they were at first 
she then began to speak of you and of the great kindness you 
had shewn her during her illness and with a blush which shewed me 
how it was all connected desired me whenever i had an opportunity 
to thank you i could not thank you too much for every wish and 
every endeavour to do her good she was sensible that you had never 
received any proper acknowledgment from herself 
if i did not know her to be happy now said emma seriously 
which in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous 
conscience she must be i could not bear these thanks for oh 
mrs weston if there were an account drawn up of the evil 
and the good i have done miss fairfax well checking herself 
and trying to be more lively this is all to be forgotten 
you are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars 
they shew her to the greatest advantage i am sure she is very good 
i hope she will be very happy it is fit that the fortune 
should be on his side for i think the merit will be all on hers 
such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by mrs weston 
she thought well of frank in almost every respect and what was more 
she loved him very much and her defence was therefore earnest 
she talked with a great deal of reason and at least equal affection 
but she had too much to urge for emma s attention it was soon gone 
to brunswick square or to donwell she forgot to attempt to listen 
and when mrs weston ended with we have not yet had the letter 
we are so anxious for you know but i hope it will soon come 
she was obliged to pause before she answered and at last obliged 
to answer at random before she could at all recollect what letter it 
was which they were so anxious for 
are you well my emma was mrs weston s parting question 
oh perfectly i am always well you know be sure to give me 
intelligence of the letter as soon as possible 
mrs weston s communications furnished emma with more food for 
unpleasant reflection by increasing her esteem and compassion 
and her sense of past injustice towards miss fairfax she bitterly 
regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her and blushed 
for the envious feelings which had certainly been in some measure 
the because had she followed mr knightley s known wishes in paying 
that attention to miss fairfax which was every way her due had she 
tried to know her better had she done her part towards intimacy 
had she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in harriet smith 
she must in all probability have been spared from every pain 
which pressed on her now birth abilities and education 
had been equally marking one as an associate for her to be received 
with gratitude and the other what was she supposing even that 
they had never become intimate friends that she had never been 
admitted into miss fairfax s confidence on this important matter 
which was most probable still in knowing her as she ought 
and as she might she must have been preserved from the abominable 
suspicions of an improper attachment to mr dixon which she had 
not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself but had so 
unpardonably imparted an idea which she greatly feared had been made 
a subject of material distress to the delicacy of jane s feelings 
by the levity or carelessness of frank churchill s of all the sources 
of evil surrounding the former since her coming to highbury 
she was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst 
she must have been a perpetual enemy they never could have been 
all three together without her having stabbed jane fairfax s peace 
in a thousand instances and on box hill perhaps it had been 
the agony of a mind that would bear no more 
the evening of this day was very long and melancholy at hartfield 
the weather added what it could of gloom a cold stormy rain set in 
and nothing of july appeared but in the trees and shrubs which the 
wind was despoiling and the length of the day which only made 
such cruel sights the longer visible 
the weather affected mr woodhouse and he could only be kept tolerably 
comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter s side 
and by exertions which had never cost her half so much before 
it reminded her of their first forlorn tete a tete on the evening 
of mrs weston s wedding day but mr knightley had walked 
in then soon after tea and dissipated every melancholy fancy 
alas such delightful proofs of hartfield s attraction as those 
sort of visits conveyed might shortly be over the picture which 
she had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter 
had proved erroneous no friends had deserted them no pleasures 
had been lost but her present forebodings she feared would 
experience no similar contradiction the prospect before her now 
was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled 
that might not be even partially brightened if all took place 
that might take place among the circle of her friends hartfield must 
be comparatively deserted and she left to cheer her father with the 
spirits only of ruined happiness 
the child to be born at randalls must be a tie there even dearer 
than herself and mrs weston s heart and time would be occupied 
by it they should lose her and probably in great measure 
her husband also frank churchill would return among them no more 
and miss fairfax it was reasonable to suppose would soon cease 
to belong to highbury they would be married and settled either 
at or near enscombe all that were good would be withdrawn and if 
to these losses the loss of donwell were to be added what would 
remain of cheerful or of rational society within their reach 
mr knightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfort 
no longer walking in at all hours as if ever willing to change 
his own home for their s how was it to be endured and if he were 
to be lost to them for harriet s sake if he were to be thought 
of hereafter as finding in harriet s society all that he wanted 
if harriet were to be the chosen the first the dearest the friend 
the wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence 
what could be increasing emma s wretchedness but the reflection never far 
distant from her mind that it had been all her own work 
when it came to such a pitch as this she was not able to refrain 
from a start or a heavy sigh or even from walking about the room 
for a few seconds and the only source whence any thing like consolation 
or composure could be drawn was in the resolution of her own 
better conduct and the hope that however inferior in spirit and 
gaiety might be the following and every future winter of her life 
to the past it would yet find her more rational more acquainted 
with herself and leave her less to regret when it were gone 
chapter xiii 
the weather continued much the same all the following morning 
and the same loneliness and the same melancholy seemed to 
reign at hartfield but in the afternoon it cleared the wind 
changed into a softer quarter the clouds were carried off 
the sun appeared it was summer again with all the eagerness 
which such a transition gives emma resolved to be out of doors 
as soon as possible never had the exquisite sight smell 
sensation of nature tranquil warm and brilliant after a storm 
been more attractive to her she longed for the serenity they might 
gradually introduce and on mr perry s coming in soon after dinner 
with a disengaged hour to give her father she lost no time ill 
hurrying into the shrubbery there with spirits freshened 
and thoughts a little relieved she had taken a few turns when she 
saw mr knightley passing through the garden door and coming 
towards her it was the first intimation of his being returned 
from london she had been thinking of him the moment before 
as unquestionably sixteen miles distant there was time only for 
the quickest arrangement of mind she must be collected and calm 
in half a minute they were together the how d ye do s were quiet 
and constrained on each side she asked after their mutual friends 
they were all well when had he left them only that morning 
he must have had a wet ride yes he meant to walk with her 
she found he had just looked into the dining room and as he 
was not wanted there preferred being out of doors she thought 
he neither looked nor spoke cheerfully and the first possible 
because for it suggested by her fears was that he had perhaps been 
communicating his plans to his brother and was pained by the manner 
in which they had been received 
they walked together he was silent she thought he was often 
looking at her and trying for a fuller view of her face than it 
suited her to give and this belief produced another dread 
perhaps he wanted to speak to her of his attachment to harriet 
he might be watching for encouragement to begin she did not 
could not feel equal to lead the way to any such subject 
he must do it all himself yet she could not bear this silence 
with him it was most unnatural she considered resolved and trying 
to smile began 
you have some news to hear now you are come back that will rather 
surprize you 
have i said he quietly and looking at her of what nature 
oh the best nature in the world a wedding 
after waiting a moment as if to be sure she intended to say no more 
he replied 
if you mean miss fairfax and frank churchill i have heard 
that already 
how is it possible cried emma turning her glowing cheeks 
towards him for while she spoke it occurred to her that he 
might have called at mrs goddard s in his way 
i had a few lines on parish business from mr weston this morning 
and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened 
emma was quite relieved and could presently say with a little 
more composure 
you probably have been less surprized than any of us for you have 
had your suspicions i have not forgotten that you once tried to give 
me a caution i wish i had attended to it but with a sinking 
voice and a heavy sigh i seem to have been doomed to blindness 
for a moment or two nothing was said and she was unsuspicious 
of having excited any particular interest till she found her arm 
drawn within his and pressed against his heart and heard him 
thus saying in a tone of great sensibility speaking low 
time my dearest emma time will heal the wound your own 
excellent sense your exertions for your father s sake i know 
you will not allow yourself her arm was pressed again 
as he added in a more broken and subdued accent the feelings 
of the warmest friendship indignation abominable scoundrel 
and in a louder steadier tone he concluded with he will soon 
be gone they will soon be in yorkshire i am sorry for her 
she deserves a better fate 
emma understood him and as soon as she could recover from the 
flutter of pleasure excited by such tender consideration replied 
you are very kind but you are mistaken and i must set you right 
i am not in want of that sort of compassion my blindness to what 
was going on led me to act by them in a way that i must always 
be ashamed of and i was very foolishly tempted to say and do many 
things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures but i 
have no other reason to regret that i was not in the secret earlier 
emma cried he looking eagerly at her are you indeed 
but checking himself no no i understand you forgive me i am 
pleased that you can say even so much he is no object of regret 
indeed and it will not be very long i hope before that becomes 
the acknowledgment of more than your reason fortunate that your 
affections were not farther entangled i could never i confess 
from your manners assure myself as to the degree of what you felt 
i could only be certain that there was a preference and a preference 
which i never believed him to deserve he is a disgrace to the name 
of man and is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman 
jane jane you will be a miserable creature 
mr knightley said emma trying to be lively but really confused 
i am in a very extraordinary situation i cannot let you continue in 
your error and yet perhaps since my manners gave such an impression 
i have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that i never have 
been at all attached to the person we are speaking of as it might 
be natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse 
but i never have 
he listened in perfect silence she wished him to speak but he 
would not she supposed she must say more before she were entitled 
to his clemency but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower 
herself in his opinion she went on however 
i have very little to say for my own conduct i was tempted 
by his attentions and allowed myself to appear pleased 
an old story probably a common case and no more than has happened 
to hundreds of my sex before and yet it may not be the more excusable 
in one who sets up as i do for understanding many circumstances 
assisted the temptation he was the son of mr weston he was 
continually here i always found him very pleasant and in short 
for with a sigh let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously 
they all centre in this at last my vanity was flattered and i 
allowed his attentions latterly however for some time indeed 
i have had no idea of their meaning any thing i thought them 
a habit a trick nothing that called for seriousness on my side 
he has imposed on me but he has not injured me i have never been 
attached to him and now i can tolerably comprehend his behaviour 
he never wished to attach me it was merely a blind to conceal 
his real situation with another it was his object to blind 
all about him and no one i am sure could be more effectually 
blinded than myself except that i was not blinded that it was my 
good fortune that in short i was somehow or other safe from him 
she had hoped for an answer here for a few words to say that her 
conduct was at least intelligible but he was silent and as far 
as she could judge deep in thought at last and tolerably 
in his usual tone he said 
i have never had a high opinion of frank churchill i can suppose 
however that i may have underrated him my acquaintance with 
him has been but trifling and even if i have not underrated 
him hitherto he may yet turn out well with such a woman he has 
a chance i have no motive for wishing him ill and for her sake 
whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct 
i shall certainly wish him well 
i have no doubt of their being happy together said emma 
i believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached 
he is a most fortunate man returned mr knightley with energy 
so early in life at three and twenty a period when if a man 
chuses a wife he generally chuses ill at three and twenty 
to have drawn such a prize what years of felicity that man 
in all human calculation has before him assured of the love of 
such a woman the disinterested love for jane fairfax s character 
vouches for her disinterestedness every thing in his favour 
equality of situation i mean as far as regards society and all the 
habits and manners that are important equality in every point but one 
and that one since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted 
such as must increase his felicity for it will be his to bestow the 
only advantages she wants a man would always wish to give a woman 
a better home than the one he takes her from and he who can do it 
where there is no doubt of her regard must i think be the happiest 
of mortals frank churchill is indeed the favourite of fortune 
every thing turns out for his good he meets with a young woman 
at a watering place gains her affection cannot even weary her 
by negligent treatment and had he and all his family sought round 
the world for a perfect wife for him they could not have found 
her superior his aunt is in the way his aunt dies he has 
only to speak his friends are eager to promote his happiness 
he had used every body ill and they are all delighted to forgive him 
he is a fortunate man indeed 
you speak as if you envied him 
and i do envy him emma in one respect he is the object of my envy 
emma could say no more they seemed to be within half a sentence 
of harriet and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject 
if possible she made her plan she would speak of something 
totally different the children in brunswick square and she 
only waited for breath to begin when mr knightley startled her 
by saying 
you will not ask me what is the point of envy you are determined 
i see to have no curiosity you are wise but i cannot be wise 
emma i must tell you what you will not ask though i may wish it 
unsaid the next moment 
oh then do not speak it do not speak it she eagerly cried 
take a little time consider do not commit yourself 
thank you said he in an accent of deep mortification and not 
another syllable followed 
emma could not bear to give him pain he was wishing to confide in her 
perhaps to consult her cost her what it would she would listen 
she might assist his resolution or reconcile him to it 
she might give just praise to harriet or by representing to him 
his own independence relieve him from that state of indecision 
which must be more intolerable than any alternative to such a mind 
as his they had reached the house 
you are going in i suppose said he 
no replied emma quite confirmed by the depressed manner 
in which he still spoke i should like to take another turn 
mr perry is not gone and after proceeding a few steps she added 
i stopped you ungraciously just now mr knightley and i am afraid 
gave you pain but if you have any wish to speak openly to me 
as a friend or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have 
in contemplation as a friend indeed you may command me i will 
hear whatever you like i will tell you exactly what i think 
as a friend repeated mr knightley emma that i fear is 
a word no i have no wish stay yes why should i hesitate 
i have gone too far already for concealment emma i accept your offer 
extraordinary as it may seem i accept it and refer myself to you 
as a friend tell me then have i no chance of ever succeeding 
he stopped in his earnestness to look the question and the expression 
of his eyes overpowered her 
my dearest emma said he for dearest you will always be 
whatever the event of this hour s conversation my dearest 
most beloved emma tell me at once say no if it is to be said 
she could really say nothing you are silent he cried 
with great animation absolutely silent at present i ask no more 
emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment 
the dread of being awakened from the happiest dream was perhaps 
the most prominent feeling 
i cannot make speeches emma he soon resumed and in a tone 
of such sincere decided intelligible tenderness as was 
tolerably convincing if i loved you less i might be able 
to talk about it more but you know what i am you hear nothing 
but truth from me i have blamed you and lectured you and you 
have borne it as no other woman in england would have borne it 
bear with the truths i would tell you now dearest emma as well as 
you have borne with them the manner perhaps may have as little 
to recommend them god knows i have been a very indifferent lover 
but you understand me yes you see you understand my feelings 
and will return them if you can at present i ask only to hear 
once to hear your voice 
while he spoke emma s mind was most busy and with all the wonderful 
velocity of thought had been able and yet without losing a word 
to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole to see that 
harriet s hopes had been entirely groundless a mistake a delusion 
as complete a delusion as any of her own that harriet was nothing 
that she was every thing herself that what she had been saying 
relative to harriet had been all taken as the language of her 
own feelings and that her agitation her doubts her reluctance 
her discouragement had been all received as discouragement 
from herself and not only was there time for these convictions 
with all their glow of attendant happiness there was time also to 
rejoice that harriet s secret had not escaped her and to resolve 
that it need not and should not it was all the service she could 
now render her poor friend for as to any of that heroism of sentiment 
which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection 
from herself to harriet as infinitely the most worthy of the two 
or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him 
at once and for ever without vouchsafing any motive because he 
could not marry them both emma had it not she felt for harriet 
with pain and with contrition but no flight of generosity run mad 
opposing all that could be probable or reasonable entered her brain 
she had led her friend astray and it would be a reproach to 
her for ever but her judgment was as strong as her feelings 
and as strong as it had ever been before in reprobating any such 
alliance for him as most unequal and degrading her way was clear 
though not quite smooth she spoke then on being so entreated 
what did she say just what she ought of course a lady always does 
she said enough to shew there need not be despair and to invite him 
to say more himself he had despaired at one period he had received 
such an injunction to caution and silence as for the time crushed 
every hope she had begun by refusing to hear him the change had 
perhaps been somewhat sudden her proposal of taking another turn 
her renewing the conversation which she had just put an end to 
might be a little extraordinary she felt its inconsistency 
but mr knightley was so obliging as to put up with it and seek no 
farther explanation 
seldom very seldom does complete truth belong to any human disclosure 
seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised 
or a little mistaken but where as in this case though the conduct 
is mistaken the feelings are not it may not be very material 
mr knightley could not impute to emma a more relenting heart than 
she possessed or a heart more disposed to accept of his 
he had in fact been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence 
he had followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it 
he had come in his anxiety to see how she bore frank churchill s 
engagement with no selfish view no view at all but of endeavouring 
if she allowed him an opening to soothe or to counsel her the rest 
had been the work of the moment the immediate effect of what he heard 
on his feelings the delightful assurance of her total indifference 
towards frank churchill of her having a heart completely disengaged 
from him had given birth to the hope that in time he might gain 
her affection himself but it had been no present hope he had only 
in the momentary conquest of eagerness over judgment aspired to be 
told that she did not forbid his attempt to attach her the superior 
hopes which gradually opened were so much the more enchanting 
the affection which he had been asking to be allowed to create 
if he could was already his within half an hour he had passed 
from a thoroughly distressed state of mind to something so like 
perfect happiness that it could bear no other name 
her change was equal this one half hour had given to each the 
same precious certainty of being beloved had cleared from each 
the same degree of ignorance jealousy or distrust on his side 
there had been a long standing jealousy old as the arrival 
or even the expectation of frank churchill he had been in love 
with emma and jealous of frank churchill from about the same period 
one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other 
it was his jealousy of frank churchill that had taken him from 
the country the box hill party had decided him on going away 
he would save himself from witnessing again such permitted 
encouraged attentions he had gone to learn to be indifferent 
but he had gone to a wrong place there was too much domestic 
happiness in his brother s house woman wore too amiable a form in it 
isabella was too much like emma differing only in those striking 
inferiorities which always brought the other in brilliancy before him 
for much to have been done even had his time been longer he had 
stayed on however vigorously day after day till this very morning s 
post had conveyed the history of jane fairfax then with the 
gladness which must be felt nay which he did not scruple to feel 
having never believed frank churchill to be at all deserving emma 
was there so much fond solicitude so much keen anxiety for her 
that he could stay no longer he had ridden home through the rain 
and had walked up directly after dinner to see how this sweetest 
and best of all creatures faultless in spite of all her faults 
bore the discovery 
he had found her agitated and low frank churchill was a villain 
he heard her declare that she had never loved him frank churchill s 
character was not desperate she was his own emma by hand and word 
when they returned into the house and if he could have thought 
of frank churchill then he might have deemed him a very good sort 
of fellow 
chapter xiv 
what totally different feelings did emma take back into the house 
from what she had brought out she had then been only daring to hope 
for a little respite of suffering she was now in an exquisite 
flutter of happiness and such happiness moreover as she believed 
must still be greater when the flutter should have passed away 
they sat down to tea the same party round the same table 
how often it had been collected and how often had her eyes fallen 
on the same shrubs in the lawn and observed the same beautiful 
effect of the western sun but never in such a state of spirits 
never in any thing like it and it was with difficulty that she could 
summon enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of the house 
or even the attentive daughter 
poor mr woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him 
in the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming and so 
anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride could he 
have seen the heart he would have cared very little for the lungs 
but without the most distant imagination of the impending evil 
without the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in 
the looks or ways of either he repeated to them very comfortably 
all the articles of news he had received from mr perry and talked 
on with much self contentment totally unsuspicious of what they 
could have told him in return 
as long as mr knightley remained with them emma s fever continued 
but when he was gone she began to be a little tranquillised 
and subdued and in the course of the sleepless night which was 
the tax for such an evening she found one or two such very serious 
points to consider as made her feel that even her happiness 
must have some alloy her father and harriet she could not be 
alone without feeling the full weight of their separate claims 
and how to guard the comfort of both to the utmost was the question 
with respect to her father it was a question soon answered 
she hardly knew yet what mr knightley would ask but a very short 
parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution 
of never quitting her father she even wept over the idea of it 
as a sin of thought while he lived it must be only an engagement 
but she flattered herself that if divested of the danger of 
drawing her away it might become an increase of comfort to him 
how to do her best by harriet was of more difficult decision 
how to spare her from any unnecessary pain how to make 
her any possible atonement how to appear least her enemy 
on these subjects her perplexity and distress were very great 
and her mind had to pass again and again through every bitter 
reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it 
she could only resolve at last that she would still avoid a 
meeting with her and communicate all that need be told by letter 
that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just 
now for a time from highbury and indulging in one scheme more 
nearly resolve that it might be practicable to get an invitation 
for her to brunswick square isabella had been pleased with harriet 
and a few weeks spent in london must give her some amusement 
she did not think it in harriet s nature to escape being benefited 
by novelty and variety by the streets the shops and the children 
at any rate it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself 
from whom every thing was due a separation for the present an averting 
of the evil day when they must all be together again 
she rose early and wrote her letter to harriet an employment 
which left her so very serious so nearly sad that mr knightley 
in walking up to hartfield to breakfast did not arrive at all too soon 
and half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again 
with him literally and figuratively was quite necessary to reinstate 
her in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before 
he had not left her long by no means long enough for her to have 
the slightest inclination for thinking of any body else when a letter 
was brought her from randalls a very thick letter she guessed 
what it must contain and deprecated the necessity of reading it 
she was now in perfect charity with frank churchill she wanted 
no explanations she wanted only to have her thoughts to herself 
and as for understanding any thing he wrote she was sure she was 
incapable of it it must be waded through however she opened 
the packet it was too surely so a note from mrs weston to herself 
ushered in the letter from frank to mrs weston 
i have the greatest pleasure my dear emma in forwarding 
to you the enclosed i know what thorough justice you will 
do it and have scarcely a doubt of its happy effect i think 
we shall never materially disagree about the writer again 
but i will not delay you by a long preface we are quite well 
this letter has been the cure of all the little nervousness i have 
been feeling lately i did not quite like your looks on tuesday 
but it was an ungenial morning and though you will never own being 
affected by weather i think every body feels a north east wind 
i felt for your dear father very much in the storm of tuesday 
afternoon and yesterday morning but had the comfort of hearing 
last night by mr perry that it had not made him ill 
yours ever 
a w 
to mrs weston 
windsor july 
my dear madam 
if i made myself intelligible yesterday this letter will be expected 
but expected or not i know it will be read with candour and indulgence 
you are all goodness and i believe there will be need of even 
all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct 
but i have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent 
my courage rises while i write it is very difficult for the 
prosperous to be humble i have already met with such success 
in two applications for pardon that i may be in danger of thinking 
myself too sure of yours and of those among your friends who have 
had any ground of offence you must all endeavour to comprehend 
the exact nature of my situation when i first arrived at randalls 
you must consider me as having a secret which was to be kept 
at all hazards this was the fact my right to place myself 
in a situation requiring such concealment is another question 
i shall not discuss it here for my temptation to think it a right 
i refer every caviller to a brick house sashed windows below 
and casements above in highbury i dared not address her openly 
my difficulties in the then state of enscombe must be too well 
known to require definition and i was fortunate enough to prevail 
before we parted at weymouth and to induce the most upright female 
mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement 
had she refused i should have gone mad but you will be ready to say 
what was your hope in doing this what did you look forward to 
to any thing every thing to time chance circumstance slow effects 
sudden bursts perseverance and weariness health and sickness 
every possibility of good was before me and the first of blessings 
secured in obtaining her promises of faith and correspondence 
if you need farther explanation i have the honour my dear madam 
of being your husband s son and the advantage of inheriting 
a disposition to hope for good which no inheritance of houses 
or lands can ever equal the value of see me then under these 
circumstances arriving on my first visit to randalls and here i 
am conscious of wrong for that visit might have been sooner paid 
you will look back and see that i did not come till miss fairfax 
was in highbury and as you were the person slighted you will 
forgive me instantly but i must work on my father s compassion 
by reminding him that so long as i absented myself from his house 
so long i lost the blessing of knowing you my behaviour 
during the very happy fortnight which i spent with you did not 
i hope lay me open to reprehension excepting on one point 
and now i come to the principal the only important part of my 
conduct while belonging to you which excites my own anxiety 
or requires very solicitous explanation with the greatest respect 
and the warmest friendship do i mention miss woodhouse my father 
perhaps will think i ought to add with the deepest humiliation 
a few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion 
and some censure i acknowledge myself liable to my behaviour 
to miss woodhouse indicated i believe more than it ought 
in order to assist a concealment so essential to me i was led 
on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy 
into which we were immediately thrown i cannot deny that miss 
woodhouse was my ostensible object but i am sure you will believe 
the declaration that had i not been convinced of her indifference 
i would not have been induced by any selfish views to go on 
amiable and delightful as miss woodhouse is she never gave me 
the idea of a young woman likely to be attached and that she was 
perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me was as much 
my conviction as my wish she received my attentions with an easy 
friendly goodhumoured playfulness which exactly suited me 
we seemed to understand each other from our relative situation 
those attentions were her due and were felt to be so whether miss 
woodhouse began really to understand me before the expiration of 
that fortnight i cannot say when i called to take leave of her 
i remember that i was within a moment of confessing the truth 
and i then fancied she was not without suspicion but i have no 
doubt of her having since detected me at least in some degree 
she may not have surmised the whole but her quickness must 
have penetrated a part i cannot doubt it you will find 
whenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints 
that it did not take her wholly by surprize she frequently gave 
me hints of it i remember her telling me at the ball that i 
owed mrs elton gratitude for her attentions to miss fairfax 
i hope this history of my conduct towards her will be admitted 
by you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw amiss 
while you considered me as having sinned against emma woodhouse 
i could deserve nothing from either acquit me here and procure 
for me when it is allowable the acquittal and good wishes of that 
said emma woodhouse whom i regard with so much brotherly affection 
as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself 
whatever strange things i said or did during that fortnight you have 
now a key to my heart was in highbury and my business was to get 
my body thither as often as might be and with the least suspicion 
if you remember any queernesses set them all to the right account 
of the pianoforte so much talked of i feel it only necessary to say 
that its being ordered was absolutely unknown to miss f who would 
never have allowed me to send it had any choice been given her 
the delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement 
my dear madam is much beyond my power of doing justice to 
you will soon i earnestly hope know her thoroughly yourself 
no description can describe her she must tell you herself what she is 
yet not by word for never was there a human creature who would 
so designedly suppress her own merit since i began this letter 
which will be longer than i foresaw i have heard from her 
she gives a good account of her own health but as she never complains 
i dare not depend i want to have your opinion of her looks 
i know you will soon call on her she is living in dread of the visit 
perhaps it is paid already let me hear from you without delay 
i am impatient for a thousand particulars remember how few 
minutes i was at randalls and in how bewildered how mad a state 
and i am not much better yet still insane either from happiness 
or misery when i think of the kindness and favour i have met with 
of her excellence and patience and my uncle s generosity i am mad 
with joy but when i recollect all the uneasiness i occasioned her 
and how little i deserve to be forgiven i am mad with anger 
if i could but see her again but i must not propose it yet 
my uncle has been too good for me to encroach i must still add 
to this long letter you have not heard all that you ought to hear 
i could not give any connected detail yesterday but the suddenness 
and in one light the unseasonableness with which the affair burst out 
needs explanation for though the event of the th ult as you 
will conclude immediately opened to me the happiest prospects 
i should not have presumed on such early measures but from the 
very particular circumstances which left me not an hour to lose 
i should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty and she would have 
felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and refinement 
but i had no choice the hasty engagement she had entered into with 
that woman here my dear madam i was obliged to leave off abruptly 
to recollect and compose myself i have been walking over the country 
and am now i hope rational enough to make the rest of my letter 
what it ought to be it is in fact a most mortifying retrospect 
for me i behaved shamefully and here i can admit that my manners 
to miss w in being unpleasant to miss f were highly blameable 
she disapproved them which ought to have been enough my plea of 
concealing the truth she did not think sufficient she was displeased 
i thought unreasonably so i thought her on a thousand occasions 
unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious i thought her even cold 
but she was always right if i had followed her judgment and subdued 
my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper i should have 
escaped the greatest unhappiness i have ever known we quarrelled 
do you remember the morning spent at donwell there every little 
dissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis i was late 
i met her walking home by herself and wanted to walk with her 
but she would not suffer it she absolutely refused to allow me 
which i then thought most unreasonable now however i see nothing 
in it but a very natural and consistent degree of discretion 
while i to blind the world to our engagement was behaving one 
hour with objectionable particularity to another woman was she 
to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made 
every previous caution useless had we been met walking together 
between donwell and highbury the truth must have been suspected 
i was mad enough however to resent i doubted her affection 
i doubted it more the next day on box hill when provoked by 
such conduct on my side such shameful insolent neglect of her 
and such apparent devotion to miss w as it would have been 
impossible for any woman of sense to endure she spoke her 
resentment in a form of words perfectly intelligible to me 
in short my dear madam it was a quarrel blameless on her side 
abominable on mine and i returned the same evening to richmond 
though i might have staid with you till the next morning 
merely because i would be as angry with her as possible even then 
i was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time 
but i was the injured person injured by her coldness and i went 
away determined that she should make the first advances i shall 
always congratulate myself that you were not of the box hill party 
had you witnessed my behaviour there i can hardly suppose you would 
ever have thought well of me again its effect upon her appears 
in the immediate resolution it produced as soon as she found i 
was really gone from randalls she closed with the offer of that 
officious mrs elton the whole system of whose treatment of her 
by the bye has ever filled me with indignation and hatred 
i must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been 
so richly extended towards myself but otherwise i should loudly 
protest against the share of it which that woman has known 
jane indeed you will observe that i have not yet indulged myself 
in calling her by that name even to you think then what i must 
have endured in hearing it bandied between the eltons with all 
the vulgarity of needless repetition and all the insolence of 
imaginary superiority have patience with me i shall soon have done 
she closed with this offer resolving to break with me entirely 
and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again 
she felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery 
to each she dissolved it this letter reached me on the very 
morning of my poor aunt s death i answered it within an hour 
but from the confusion of my mind and the multiplicity of business 
falling on me at once my answer instead of being sent with all 
the many other letters of that day was locked up in my writing desk 
and i trusting that i had written enough though but a few lines 
to satisfy her remained without any uneasiness i was rather 
disappointed that i did not hear from her again speedily 
but i made excuses for her and was too busy and may i add 
too cheerful in my views to be captious we removed to windsor 
and two days afterwards i received a parcel from her my own letters 
all returned and a few lines at the same time by the post 
stating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply 
to her last and adding that as silence on such a point could 
not be misconstrued and as it must be equally desirable to both 
to have every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible 
she now sent me by a safe conveyance all my letters and requested 
that if i could not directly command hers so as to send them 
to highbury within a week i would forward them after that period 
to her at in short the full direction to mr smallridge s 
near bristol stared me in the face i knew the name the place 
i knew all about it and instantly saw what she had been doing 
it was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character 
which i knew her to possess and the secrecy she had maintained 
as to any such design in her former letter was equally descriptive 
of its anxious delicacy for the world would not she have seemed 
to threaten me imagine the shock imagine how till i had actually 
detected my own blunder i raved at the blunders of the post 
what was to be done one thing only i must speak to my uncle 
without his sanction i could not hope to be listened to again 
i spoke circumstances were in my favour the late event had softened 
away his pride and he was earlier than i could have anticipated 
wholly reconciled and complying and could say at last poor man 
with a deep sigh that he wished i might find as much happiness 
in the marriage state as he had done i felt that it would be 
of a different sort are you disposed to pity me for what i must 
have suffered in opening the because to him for my suspense while 
all was at stake no do not pity me till i reached highbury 
and saw how ill i had made her do not pity me till i saw her wan 
sick looks i reached highbury at the time of day when from my 
knowledge of their late breakfast hour i was certain of a good chance 
of finding her alone i was not disappointed and at last i was 
not disappointed either in the object of my journey a great deal 
of very reasonable very just displeasure i had to persuade away 
but it is done we are reconciled dearer much dearer than ever 
and no moment s uneasiness can ever occur between us again now my 
dear madam i will release you but i could not conclude before 
a thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you have 
ever shewn me and ten thousand for the attentions your heart 
will dictate towards her if you think me in a way to be happier 
than i deserve i am quite of your opinion miss w calls me 
the child of good fortune i hope she is right in one respect 
my good fortune is undoubted that of being able to subscribe 
myself 
your obliged and affectionate son 
f c weston churchill 
chapter xv 
this letter must make its way to emma s feelings she was obliged 
in spite of her previous determination to the contrary to do 
it all the justice that mrs weston foretold as soon as she 
came to her own name it was irresistible every line relating 
to herself was interesting and almost every line agreeable 
and when this charm ceased the subject could still maintain itself 
by the natural return of her former regard for the writer and the 
very strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her at 
that moment she never stopt till she had gone through the whole 
and though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong 
yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed and he had suffered 
and was very sorry and he was so grateful to mrs weston 
and so much in love with miss fairfax and she was so happy herself 
that there was no being severe and could he have entered the room 
she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever 
she thought so well of the letter that when mr knightley came again 
she desired him to read it she was sure of mrs weston s wishing 
it to be communicated especially to one who like mr knightley 
had seen so much to blame in his conduct 
i shall be very glad to look it over said he but it seems long 
i will take it home with me at night 
but that would not do mr weston was to call in the evening 
and she must return it by him 
i would rather be talking to you he replied but as it seems 
a matter of justice it shall be done 
he began stopping however almost directly to say had i been offered 
the sight of one of this gentleman s letters to his mother in law a few 
months ago emma it would not have been taken with such indifference 
he proceeded a little farther reading to himself and then 
with a smile observed humph a fine complimentary opening 
but it is his way one man s style must not be the rule of another s 
we will not be severe 
it will be natural for me he added shortly afterwards to speak my 
opinion aloud as i read by doing it i shall feel that i am near you 
it will not be so great a loss of time but if you dislike it 
not at all i should wish it 
mr knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity 
he trifles here said he as to the temptation he knows 
he is wrong and has nothing rational to urge bad he ought 
not to have formed the engagement his father s disposition 
he is unjust however to his father mr weston s sanguine 
temper was a blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions 
but mr weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured 
to gain it very true he did not come till miss fairfax was here 
and i have not forgotten said emma how sure you were that he 
might have come sooner if he would you pass it over very handsomely 
but you were perfectly right 
i was not quite impartial in my judgment emma but yet i think 
had you not been in the case i should still have distrusted him 
when he came to miss woodhouse he was obliged to read the whole 
of it aloud all that related to her with a smile a look 
a shake of the head a word or two of assent or disapprobation 
or merely of love as the subject required concluding however 
seriously and after steady reflection thus 
very bad though it might have been worse playing a most 
dangerous game too much indebted to the event for his acquittal 
no judge of his own manners by you always deceived in fact by his 
own wishes and regardless of little besides his own convenience 
fancying you to have fathomed his secret natural enough 
his own mind full of intrigue that he should suspect it 
in others mystery finesse how they pervert the understanding 
my emma does not every thing serve to prove more and more the 
beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other 
emma agreed to it and with a blush of sensibility on harriet s account 
which she could not give any sincere explanation of 
you had better go on said she 
he did so but very soon stopt again to say the pianoforte 
ah that was the act of a very very young man one too young 
to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much 
exceed the pleasure a boyish scheme indeed i cannot 
comprehend a man s wishing to give a woman any proof of affection 
which he knows she would rather dispense with and he did 
know that she would have prevented the instrument s coming if she could 
after this he made some progress without any pause 
frank churchill s confession of having behaved shamefully 
was the first thing to call for more than a word in passing 
i perfectly agree with you sir was then his remark 
you did behave very shamefully you never wrote a truer line 
and having gone through what immediately followed of the basis 
of their disagreement and his persisting to act in direct 
opposition to jane fairfax s sense of right he made a fuller pause 
to say this is very bad he had induced her to place herself 
for his sake in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness 
and it should have been his first object to prevent her from 
suffering unnecessarily she must have had much more to contend with 
in carrying on the correspondence than he could he should have 
respected even unreasonable scruples had there been such but hers 
were all reasonable we must look to her one fault and remember 
that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement 
to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment 
emma knew that he was now getting to the box hill party 
and grew uncomfortable her own behaviour had been so very improper 
she was deeply ashamed and a little afraid of his next look 
it was all read however steadily attentively and without 
the smallest remark and excepting one momentary glance at her 
instantly withdrawn in the fear of giving pain no remembrance 
of box hill seemed to exist 
there is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends 
the eltons was his next observation his feelings are natural 
what actually resolve to break with him entirely she felt 
the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each 
she dissolved it what a view this gives of her sense of 
his behaviour well he must be a most extraordinary 
nay nay read on you will find how very much he suffers 
i hope he does replied mr knightley coolly and resuming the letter 
smallridge what does this mean what is all this 
she had engaged to go as governess to mrs smallridge s children 
a dear friend of mrs elton s a neighbour of maple grove and 
by the bye i wonder how mrs elton bears the disappointment 
say nothing my dear emma while you oblige me to read not even 
of mrs elton only one page more i shall soon have done 
what a letter the man writes 
i wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him 
well there is feeling here he does seem to have suffered in finding 
her ill certainly i can have no doubt of his being fond of her 
dearer much dearer than ever i hope he may long continue to feel 
all the value of such a reconciliation he is a very liberal thanker 
with his thousands and tens of thousands happier than i deserve 
come he knows himself there miss woodhouse calls me the child 
of good fortune those were miss woodhouse s words were they 
and a fine ending and there is the letter the child of good fortune 
that was your name for him was it 
you do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as i am 
but still you must at least i hope you must think the better 
of him for it i hope it does him some service with you 
yes certainly it does he has had great faults faults of 
inconsideration and thoughtlessness and i am very much of his 
opinion in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves 
but still as he is beyond a doubt really attached to miss fairfax 
and will soon it may be hoped have the advantage of being constantly 
with her i am very ready to believe his character will improve 
and acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle 
that it wants and now let me talk to you of something else 
i have another person s interest at present so much at heart 
that i cannot think any longer about frank churchill ever since i 
left you this morning emma my mind has been hard at work on 
one subject 
the subject followed it was in plain unaffected gentlemanlike english 
such as mr knightley used even to the woman he was in love with 
how to be able to ask her to marry him without attacking the 
happiness of her father emma s answer was ready at the first word 
while her dear father lived any change of condition must be impossible 
for her she could never quit him part only of this answer 
however was admitted the impossibility of her quitting her father 
mr knightley felt as strongly as herself but the inadmissibility 
of any other change he could not agree to he had been thinking 
it over most deeply most intently he had at first hoped to induce 
mr woodhouse to remove with her to donwell he had wanted to believe 
it feasible but his knowledge of mr woodhouse would not suffer 
him to deceive himself long and now he confessed his persuasion 
that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father s comfort 
perhaps even of his life which must not be hazarded mr woodhouse 
taken from hartfield no he felt that it ought not to be attempted 
but the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this he trusted 
his dearest emma would not find in any respect objectionable 
it was that he should be received at hartfield that so long as 
her father s happiness in other words his life required hartfield 
to continue her home it should be his likewise 
of their all removing to donwell emma had already had her own 
passing thoughts like him she had tried the scheme and rejected it 
but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her 
she was sensible of all the affection it evinced she felt that 
in quitting donwell he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence 
of hours and habits that in living constantly with her father 
and in no house of his own there would be much very much 
to be borne with she promised to think of it and advised him 
to think of it more but he was fully convinced that no reflection 
could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject he had 
given it he could assure her very long and calm consideration 
he had been walking away from william larkins the whole morning 
to have his thoughts to himself 
ah there is one difficulty unprovided for cried emma i am 
sure william larkins will not like it you must get his consent 
before you ask mine 
she promised however to think of it and pretty nearly promised moreover 
to think of it with the intention of finding it a very good scheme 
it is remarkable that emma in the many very many points of view 
in which she was now beginning to consider donwell abbey was never 
struck with any sense of injury to her nephew henry whose rights 
as heir expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded 
think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy 
and yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it 
and found amusement in detecting the real because of that violent 
dislike of mr knightley s marrying jane fairfax or any body else 
which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of 
the sister and the aunt 
this proposal of his this plan of marrying and continuing at hartfield 
the more she contemplated it the more pleasing it became 
his evils seemed to lessen her own advantages to increase 
their mutual good to outweigh every drawback such a companion 
for herself in the periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her 
such a partner in all those duties and cares to which time must be 
giving increase of melancholy 
she would have been too happy but for poor harriet but every 
blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings 
of her friend who must now be even excluded from hartfield 
the delightful family party which emma was securing for herself 
poor harriet must in mere charitable caution be kept at a 
distance from she would be a loser in every way emma could not 
deplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment 
in such a party harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise 
but for the poor girl herself it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity 
that was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited punishment 
in time of course mr knightley would be forgotten that is 
supplanted but this could not be expected to happen very early 
mr knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure 
not like mr elton mr knightley always so kind so feeling 
so truly considerate for every body would never deserve to be 
less worshipped than now and it really was too much to hope even 
of harriet that she could be in love with more than three men 
in one year 
chapter xvi 
it was a very great relief to emma to find harriet as desirous 
as herself to avoid a meeting their intercourse was painful 
enough by letter how much worse had they been obliged to meet 
harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed 
without reproaches or apparent sense of ill usage and yet emma fancied 
there was a something of resentment a something bordering on it in 
her style which increased the desirableness of their being separate 
it might be only her own consciousness but it seemed as if an 
angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke 
she had no difficulty in procuring isabella s invitation 
and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it 
without resorting to invention there was a tooth amiss 
harriet really wished and had wished some time to consult a dentist 
mrs john knightley was delighted to be of use any thing of ill 
health was a recommendation to her and though not so fond of a 
dentist as of a mr wingfield she was quite eager to have harriet 
under her care when it was thus settled on her sister s side 
emma proposed it to her friend and found her very persuadable 
harriet was to go she was invited for at least a fortnight she was 
to be conveyed in mr woodhouse s carriage it was all arranged 
it was all completed and harriet was safe in brunswick square 
now emma could indeed enjoy mr knightley s visits now she 
could talk and she could listen with true happiness unchecked by 
that sense of injustice of guilt of something most painful 
which had haunted her when remembering how disappointed a heart was 
near her how much might at that moment and at a little distance 
be enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself 
the difference of harriet at mrs goddard s or in london made perhaps 
an unreasonable difference in emma s sensations but she could not 
think of her in london without objects of curiosity and employment 
which must be averting the past and carrying her out of herself 
she would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place 
in her mind which harriet had occupied there was a communication 
before her one which she only could be competent to make 
the confession of her engagement to her father but she would 
have nothing to do with it at present she had resolved to defer 
the disclosure till mrs weston were safe and well no additional 
agitation should be thrown at this period among those she loved 
and the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the 
appointed time a fortnight at least of leisure and peace of mind 
to crown every warmer but more agitating delight should be hers 
she soon resolved equally as a duty and a pleasure to employ half 
an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on miss fairfax 
she ought to go and she was longing to see her the resemblance of 
their present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill 
it would be a secret satisfaction but the consciousness of a 
similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with 
which she should attend to any thing jane might communicate 
she went she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door but had 
not been into the house since the morning after box hill when poor 
jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion 
though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected 
the fear of being still unwelcome determined her though assured 
of their being at home to wait in the passage and send up her name 
she heard patty announcing it but no such bustle succeeded as poor 
miss bates had before made so happily intelligible no she heard 
nothing but the instant reply of beg her to walk up and a moment 
afterwards she was met on the stairs by jane herself coming eagerly 
forward as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient 
emma had never seen her look so well so lovely so engaging 
there was consciousness animation and warmth there was every 
thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted 
she came forward with an offered hand and said in a low but very 
feeling tone 
this is most kind indeed miss woodhouse it is impossible 
for me to express i hope you will believe excuse me for being 
so entirely without words 
emma was gratified and would soon have shewn no want of words 
if the sound of mrs elton s voice from the sitting room had not 
checked her and made it expedient to compress all her friendly 
and all her congratulatory sensations into a very very earnest 
shake of the hand 
mrs bates and mrs elton were together miss bates was out 
which accounted for the previous tranquillity emma could have 
wished mrs elton elsewhere but she was in a humour to have patience 
with every body and as mrs elton met her with unusual graciousness 
she hoped the rencontre would do them no harm 
she soon believed herself to penetrate mrs elton s thoughts 
and understand why she was like herself in happy spirits 
it was being in miss fairfax s confidence and fancying herself 
acquainted with what was still a secret to other people 
emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face 
and while paying her own compliments to mrs bates and appearing 
to attend to the good old lady s replies she saw her with a sort 
of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently 
been reading aloud to miss fairfax and return it into the purple 
and gold reticule by her side saying with significant nods 
we can finish this some other time you know you and i shall 
not want opportunities and in fact you have heard all the 
essential already i only wanted to prove to you that mrs s admits 
our apology and is not offended you see how delightfully 
she writes oh she is a sweet creature you would have doated 
on her had you gone but not a word more let us be discreet 
quite on our good behaviour hush you remember those lines 
i forget the poem at this moment 
for when a lady s in the case 
you know all other things give place 
now i say my dear in our case for lady read mum a word 
to the wise i am in a fine flow of spirits an t i but i want 
to set your heart at ease as to mrs s my representation you see 
has quite appeased her 
and again on emma s merely turning her head to look 
at mrs bates s knitting she added in a half whisper 
i mentioned no names you will observe oh no cautious as 
a minister of state i managed it extremely well 
emma could not doubt it was a palpable display repeated on every 
possible occasion when they had all talked a little while in harmony 
of the weather and mrs weston she found herself abruptly addressed with 
do not you think miss woodhouse our saucy little friend here is 
charmingly recovered do not you think her cure does perry the 
highest credit here was a side glance of great meaning at jane 
upon my word perry has restored her in a wonderful short time 
oh if you had seen her as i did when she was at the worst 
and when mrs bates was saying something to emma whispered farther 
we do not say a word of any assistance that perry might have 
not a word of a certain young physician from windsor oh no 
perry shall have all the credit 
i have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you miss woodhouse 
she shortly afterwards began since the party to box hill 
very pleasant party but yet i think there was something wanting 
things did not seem that is there seemed a little cloud upon 
the spirits of some so it appeared to me at least but i might 
be mistaken however i think it answered so far as to tempt one 
to go again what say you both to our collecting the same party 
and exploring to box hill again while the fine weather lasts 
it must be the same party you know quite the same party 
not one exception 
soon after this miss bates came in and emma could not help being diverted 
by the perplexity of her first answer to herself resulting she supposed 
from doubt of what might be said and impatience to say every thing 
thank you dear miss woodhouse you are all kindness it is impossible 
to say yes indeed i quite understand dearest jane s prospects 
that is i do not mean but she is charmingly recovered 
how is mr woodhouse i am so glad quite out of my power 
such a happy little circle as you find us here yes indeed 
charming young man that is so very friendly i mean good mr perry 
such attention to jane and from her great her more than commonly 
thankful delight towards mrs elton for being there emma guessed 
that there had been a little show of resentment towards jane 
from the vicarage quarter which was now graciously overcome 
after a few whispers indeed which placed it beyond a guess 
mrs elton speaking louder said 
yes here i am my good friend and here i have been so long 
that anywhere else i should think it necessary to apologise 
but the truth is that i am waiting for my lord and master 
he promised to join me here and pay his respects to you 
what are we to have the pleasure of a call from mr elton 
that will be a favour indeed for i know gentlemen do not like 
morning visits and mr elton s time is so engaged 
upon my word it is miss bates he really is engaged from morning 
to night there is no end of people s coming to him on some pretence 
or other the magistrates and overseers and churchwardens 
are always wanting his opinion they seem not able to do any thing 
without him upon my word mr e i often say rather you than i 
i do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument 
if i had half so many applicants bad enough as it is for i 
absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree i believe 
i have not played a bar this fortnight however he is coming 
i assure you yes indeed on purpose to wait on you all and putting 
up her hand to screen her words from emma a congratulatory visit 
you know oh yes quite indispensable 
miss bates looked about her so happily 
he promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself 
from knightley but he and knightley are shut up together 
in deep consultation mr e is knightley s right hand 
emma would not have smiled for the world and only said is mr elton 
gone on foot to donwell he will have a hot walk 
oh no it is a meeting at the crown a regular meeting 
weston and cole will be there too but one is apt to speak only 
of those who lead i fancy mr e and knightley have every thing 
their own way 
have not you mistaken the day said emma i am almost certain 
that the meeting at the crown is not till to morrow mr knightley 
was at hartfield yesterday and spoke of it as for saturday 
oh no the meeting is certainly to day was the abrupt answer 
which denoted the impossibility of any blunder on mrs elton s side 
i do believe she continued this is the most troublesome parish 
that ever was we never heard of such things at maple grove 
your parish there was small said jane 
upon my word my dear i do not know for i never heard the subject 
talked of 
but it is proved by the smallness of the school which i have heard 
you speak of as under the patronage of your sister and mrs bragge 
the only school and not more than five and twenty children 
ah you clever creature that is very true what a thinking brain 
you have i say jane what a perfect character you and i should make 
if we could be shaken together my liveliness and your solidity 
would produce perfection not that i presume to insinuate however 
that some people may not think you perfection already but hush 
not a word if you please 
it seemed an unnecessary caution jane was wanting to give her words 
not to mrs elton but to miss woodhouse as the latter plainly saw 
the wish of distinguishing her as far as civility permitted 
was very evident though it could not often proceed beyond a look 
mr elton made his appearance his lady greeted him with some 
of her sparkling vivacity 
very pretty sir upon my word to send me on here to be an 
encumbrance to my friends so long before you vouchsafe to come 
but you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with 
you knew i should not stir till my lord and master appeared 
here have i been sitting this hour giving these young ladies 
a sample of true conjugal obedience for who can say you know 
how soon it may be wanted 
mr elton was so hot and tired that all this wit seemed thrown away 
his civilities to the other ladies must be paid but his subsequent 
object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering 
and the walk he had had for nothing 
when i got to donwell said he knightley could not be found 
very odd very unaccountable after the note i sent him this morning 
and the message he returned that he should certainly be at home 
till one 
donwell cried his wife my dear mr e you have not been 
to donwell you mean the crown you come from the meeting at the crown 
no no that is to morrow and i particularly wanted to see knightley 
to day on that very account such a dreadful broiling morning 
i went over the fields too speaking in a tone of great ill usage 
which made it so much the worse and then not to find him at home 
i assure you i am not at all pleased and no apology left no message 
for me the housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected 
very extraordinary and nobody knew at all which way he was gone 
perhaps to hartfield perhaps to the abbey mill perhaps into his woods 
miss woodhouse this is not like our friend knightley can you 
explain it 
emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary 
indeed and that she had not a syllable to say for him 
i cannot imagine said mrs elton feeling the indignity as a wife 
ought to do i cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you 
of all people in the world the very last person whom one should expect 
to be forgotten my dear mr e he must have left a message for you 
i am sure he must not even knightley could be so very eccentric 
and his servants forgot it depend upon it that was the case 
and very likely to happen with the donwell servants who are all 
i have often observed extremely awkward and remiss i am sure i 
would not have such a creature as his harry stand at our sideboard 
for any consideration and as for mrs hodges wright holds 
her very cheap indeed she promised wright a receipt and never 
sent it 
i met william larkins continued mr elton as i got near 
the house and he told me i should not find his master at home 
but i did not believe him william seemed rather out of humour 
he did not know what was come to his master lately he said but he 
could hardly ever get the speech of him i have nothing to do with 
william s wants but it really is of very great importance that i 
should see knightley to day and it becomes a matter therefore 
of very serious inconvenience that i should have had this hot walk 
to no purpose 
emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly 
in all probability she was at this very time waited for there 
and mr knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression 
towards mr elton if not towards william larkins 
she was pleased on taking leave to find miss fairfax determined 
to attend her out of the room to go with her even downstairs 
it gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of 
to say 
it is as well perhaps that i have not had the possibility 
had you not been surrounded by other friends i might have been 
tempted to introduce a subject to ask questions to speak more 
openly than might have been strictly correct i feel that i should 
certainly have been impertinent 
oh cried jane with a blush and an hesitation which emma thought 
infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her 
usual composure there would have been no danger the danger 
would have been of my wearying you you could not have gratified 
me more than by expressing an interest indeed miss woodhouse 
speaking more collectedly with the consciousness which i 
have of misconduct very great misconduct it is particularly 
consoling to me to know that those of my friends whose good 
opinion is most worth preserving are not disgusted to such a 
degree as to i have not time for half that i could wish to say 
i long to make apologies excuses to urge something for myself 
i feel it so very due but unfortunately in short if your 
compassion does not stand my friend 
oh you are too scrupulous indeed you are cried emma warmly 
and taking her hand you owe me no apologies and every body to 
whom you might be supposed to owe them is so perfectly satisfied 
so delighted even 
you are very kind but i know what my manners were to you 
so cold and artificial i had always a part to act it was a life 
of deceit i know that i must have disgusted you 
pray say no more i feel that all the apologies should be on my side 
let us forgive each other at once we must do whatever is to be 
done quickest and i think our feelings will lose no time there 
i hope you have pleasant accounts from windsor 
very 
and the next news i suppose will be that we are to lose you 
just as i begin to know you 
oh as to all that of course nothing can be thought of yet 
i am here till claimed by colonel and mrs campbell 
nothing can be actually settled yet perhaps replied emma 
smiling but excuse me it must be thought of 
the smile was returned as jane answered 
you are very right it has been thought of and i will own 
to you i am sure it will be safe that so far as our living 
with mr churchill at enscombe it is settled there must be 
three months at least of deep mourning but when they are over 
i imagine there will be nothing more to wait for 
thank you thank you this is just what i wanted to be assured of 
oh if you knew how much i love every thing that is decided and open 
good bye good bye 
chapter xvii 
mrs weston s friends were all made happy by her safety 
and if the satisfaction of her well doing could be increased 
to emma it was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl 
she had been decided in wishing for a miss weston she would 
not acknowledge that it was with any view of making a match 
for her hereafter with either of isabella s sons but she was 
convinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother best 
it would be a great comfort to mr weston as he grew older 
and even mr weston might be growing older ten years hence to have 
his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense the freaks 
and the fancies of a child never banished from home and mrs weston 
no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her and it 
would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach 
should not have their powers in exercise again 
she has had the advantage you know of practising on me 
she continued like la baronne d almane on la comtesse d ostalis 
in madame de genlis adelaide and theodore and we shall now see 
her own little adelaide educated on a more perfect plan 
that is replied mr knightley she will indulge her even more 
than she did you and believe that she does not indulge her at all 
it will be the only difference 
poor child cried emma at that rate what will become of her 
nothing very bad the fate of thousands she will be disagreeable 
in infancy and correct herself as she grows older i am losing 
all my bitterness against spoilt children my dearest emma 
i who am owing all my happiness to you would not it be horrible 
ingratitude in me to be severe on them 
emma laughed and replied but i had the assistance of all 
your endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people 
i doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it 
do you i have no doubt nature gave you understanding 
miss taylor gave you principles you must have done well 
my interference was quite as likely to do harm as good it was 
very natural for you to say what right has he to lecture me 
and i am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done 
in a disagreeable manner i do not believe i did you any good 
the good was all to myself by making you an object of the tenderest 
affection to me i could not think about you so much without doating 
on you faults and all and by dint of fancying so many errors 
have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least 
i am sure you were of use to me cried emma i was very often 
influenced rightly by you oftener than i would own at the time 
i am very sure you did me good and if poor little anna weston is 
to be spoiled it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much 
for her as you have done for me except falling in love with her 
when she is thirteen 
how often when you were a girl have you said to me with one 
of your saucy looks mr knightley i am going to do so and so 
papa says i may or i have miss taylor s leave something which 
you knew i did not approve in such cases my interference was giving 
you two bad feelings instead of one 
what an amiable creature i was no wonder you should hold 
my speeches in such affectionate remembrance 
mr knightley you always called me mr knightley and 
from habit it has not so very formal a sound and yet it is formal 
i want you to call me something else but i do not know what 
i remember once calling you george in one of my amiable fits 
about ten years ago i did it because i thought it would offend you 
but as you made no objection i never did it again 
and cannot you call me george now 
impossible i never can call you any thing but mr knightley 
i will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of mrs elton 
by calling you mr k but i will promise she added presently 
laughing and blushing i will promise to call you once by your 
christian name i do not say when but perhaps you may guess 
where in the building in which n takes m for better for worse 
emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one 
important service which his better sense would have rendered her 
to the advice which would have saved her from the worst of all 
her womanly follies her wilful intimacy with harriet smith 
but it was too tender a subject she could not enter on it 
harriet was very seldom mentioned between them this on his side 
might merely proceed from her not being thought of but emma 
was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy and a suspicion 
from some appearances that their friendship were declining 
she was aware herself that parting under any other circumstances 
they certainly should have corresponded more and that her 
intelligence would not have rested as it now almost wholly did 
on isabella s letters he might observe that it was so the pain 
of being obliged to practise concealment towards him was very little 
inferior to the pain of having made harriet unhappy 
isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could 
be expected on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits 
which appeared perfectly natural as there was a dentist to 
be consulted but since that business had been over she did not 
appear to find harriet different from what she had known her before 
isabella to be sure was no very quick observer yet if harriet 
had not been equal to playing with the children it would not have 
escaped her emma s comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on 
by harriet s being to stay longer her fortnight was likely to be 
a month at least mr and mrs john knightley were to come down 
in august and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back 
john does not even mention your friend said mr knightley 
here is his answer if you like to see it 
it was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage 
emma accepted it with a very eager hand with an impatience all alive 
to know what he would say about it and not at all checked by hearing 
that her friend was unmentioned 
john enters like a brother into my happiness continued mr knightley 
but he is no complimenter and though i well know him to have 
likewise a most brotherly affection for you he is so far from 
making flourishes that any other young woman might think him rather 
cool in her praise but i am not afraid of your seeing what he writes 
he writes like a sensible man replied emma when she had read 
the letter i honour his sincerity it is very plain that he 
considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side 
but that he is not without hope of my growing in time as worthy 
of your affection as you think me already had he said any thing 
to bear a different construction i should not have believed him 
my emma he means no such thing he only means 
he and i should differ very little in our estimation of the two 
interrupted she with a sort of serious smile much less perhaps 
than he is aware of if we could enter without ceremony or reserve 
on the subject 
emma my dear emma 
oh she cried with more thorough gaiety if you fancy your 
brother does not do me justice only wait till my dear father is in 
the secret and hear his opinion depend upon it he will be much 
farther from doing you justice he will think all the happiness 
all the advantage on your side of the question all the merit 
on mine i wish i may not sink into poor emma with him at once 
his tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther 
ah he cried i wish your father might be half as easily convinced 
as john will be of our having every right that equal worth can give 
to be happy together i am amused by one part of john s letter 
did you notice it where he says that my information did not take 
him wholly by surprize that he was rather in expectation of hearing 
something of the kind 
if i understand your brother he only means so far as your having 
some thoughts of marrying he had no idea of me he seems perfectly 
unprepared for that 
yes yes but i am amused that he should have seen so far into 
my feelings what has he been judging by i am not conscious 
of any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare 
him at this time for my marrying any more than at another 
but it was so i suppose i dare say there was a difference when i 
was staying with them the other day i believe i did not play 
with the children quite so much as usual i remember one evening 
the poor boys saying uncle seems always tired now 
the time was coming when the news must spread farther and other persons 
reception of it tried as soon as mrs weston was sufficiently 
recovered to admit mr woodhouse s visits emma having it in view 
that her gentle reasonings should be employed in the because 
resolved first to announce it at home and then at randalls 
but how to break it to her father at last she had bound herself 
to do it in such an hour of mr knightley s absence or when it 
came to the point her heart would have failed her and she must 
have put it off but mr knightley was to come at such a time 
and follow up the beginning she was to make she was forced 
to speak and to speak cheerfully too she must not make it a more 
decided subject of misery to him by a melancholy tone herself 
she must not appear to think it a misfortune with all the spirits 
she could command she prepared him first for something strange 
and then in a few words said that if his consent and approbation 
could be obtained which she trusted would be attended with 
no difficulty since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all 
she and mr knightley meant to marry by which means hartfield 
would receive the constant addition of that person s company 
whom she knew he loved next to his daughters and mrs weston 
best in the world 
poor man it was at first a considerable shock to him and he tried 
earnestly to dissuade her from it she was reminded more than once 
of having always said she would never marry and assured that it 
would be a great deal better for her to remain single and told of 
poor isabella and poor miss taylor but it would not do emma hung 
about him affectionately and smiled and said it must be so and that 
he must not class her with isabella and mrs weston whose marriages 
taking them from hartfield had indeed made a melancholy change 
but she was not going from hartfield she should be always there 
she was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but 
for the better and she was very sure that he would be a great deal 
the happier for having mr knightley always at hand when he were once 
got used to the idea did he not love mr knightley very much 
he would not deny that he did she was sure whom did he ever want 
to consult on business but mr knightley who was so useful to him 
who so ready to write his letters who so glad to assist him 
who so cheerful so attentive so attached to him would not he 
like to have him always on the spot yes that was all very true 
mr knightley could not be there too often he should be glad to see 
him every day but they did see him every day as it was why could 
not they go on as they had done 
mr woodhouse could not be soon reconciled but the worst was overcome 
the idea was given time and continual repetition must do the rest 
to emma s entreaties and assurances succeeded mr knightley s 
whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome 
and he was soon used to be talked to by each on every fair occasion 
they had all the assistance which isabella could give by letters 
of the strongest approbation and mrs weston was ready 
on the first meeting to consider the subject in the most 
serviceable light first as a settled and secondly as a good one 
well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations 
to mr woodhouse s mind it was agreed upon as what was to be 
and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that 
it would be for his happiness and having some feelings himself 
which almost admitted it he began to think that some time or other 
in another year or two perhaps it might not be so very bad 
if the marriage did take place 
mrs weston was acting no part feigning no feelings in all that she 
said to him in favour of the event she had been extremely surprized 
never more so than when emma first opened the affair to her 
but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all and had 
no scruple in urging him to the utmost she had such a regard 
for mr knightley as to think he deserved even her dearest emma 
and it was in every respect so proper suitable and unexceptionable 
a connexion and in one respect one point of the highest importance 
so peculiarly eligible so singularly fortunate that now it seemed 
as if emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature 
and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having 
thought of it and wished it long ago how very few of those men 
in a rank of life to address emma would have renounced their own 
home for hartfield and who but mr knightley could know and bear 
with mr woodhouse so as to make such an arrangement desirable 
the difficulty of disposing of poor mr woodhouse had been always 
felt in her husband s plans and her own for a marriage between frank 
and emma how to settle the claims of enscombe and hartfield had 
been a continual impediment less acknowledged by mr weston than 
by herself but even he had never been able to finish the subject 
better than by saying those matters will take care of themselves 
the young people will find a way but here there was nothing to be 
shifted off in a wild speculation on the future it was all right 
all open all equal no sacrifice on any side worth the name 
it was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself 
and without one real rational difficulty to oppose or delay it 
mrs weston with her baby on her knee indulging in such reflections 
as these was one of the happiest women in the world if any thing 
could increase her delight it was perceiving that the baby would 
soon have outgrown its first set of caps 
the news was universally a surprize wherever it spread 
and mr weston had his five minutes share of it but five minutes 
were enough to familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind 
he saw the advantages of the match and rejoiced in them with all 
the constancy of his wife but the wonder of it was very soon nothing 
and by the end of an hour he was not far from believing that he 
had always foreseen it 
it is to be a secret i conclude said he these matters are 
always a secret till it is found out that every body knows them 
only let me be told when i may speak out i wonder whether jane has 
any suspicion 
he went to highbury the next morning and satisfied himself on 
that point he told her the news was not she like a daughter 
his eldest daughter he must tell her and miss bates being present 
it passed of course to mrs cole mrs perry and mrs elton 
immediately afterwards it was no more than the principals were 
prepared for they had calculated from the time of its being known 
at randalls how soon it would be over highbury and were thinking 
of themselves as the evening wonder in many a family circle 
with great sagacity 
in general it was a very well approved match some might think him 
and others might think her the most in luck one set might 
recommend their all removing to donwell and leaving hartfield 
for the john knightleys and another might predict disagreements 
among their servants but yet upon the whole there was no serious 
objection raised except in one habitation the vicarage there 
the surprize was not softened by any satisfaction mr elton 
cared little about it compared with his wife he only hoped the 
young lady s pride would now be contented and supposed she had 
always meant to catch knightley if she could and on the point 
of living at hartfield could daringly exclaim rather he than i 
but mrs elton was very much discomposed indeed poor knightley 
poor fellow sad business for him she was extremely concerned 
for though very eccentric he had a thousand good qualities 
how could he be so taken in did not think him at all in love 
not in the least poor knightley there would be an end of all 
pleasant intercourse with him how happy he had been to come and dine 
with them whenever they asked him but that would be all over now 
poor fellow no more exploring parties to donwell made for her 
oh no there would be a mrs knightley to throw cold water on 
every thing extremely disagreeable but she was not at all sorry 
that she had abused the housekeeper the other day shocking plan 
living together it would never do she knew a family near maple 
grove who had tried it and been obliged to separate before the end 
of the first quarter 
chapter xviii 
time passed on a few more to morrows and the party from london 
would be arriving it was an alarming change and emma was thinking 
of it one morning as what must bring a great deal to agitate and 
grieve her when mr knightley came in and distressing thoughts 
were put by after the first chat of pleasure he was silent 
and then in a graver tone began with 
i have something to tell you emma some news 
good or bad said she quickly looking up in his face 
i do not know which it ought to be called 
oh good i am sure i see it in your countenance you are trying 
not to smile 
i am afraid said he composing his features i am very much afraid 
my dear emma that you will not smile when you hear it 
indeed but why so i can hardly imagine that any thing which 
pleases or amuses you should not please and amuse me too 
there is one subject he replied i hope but one on which 
we do not think alike he paused a moment again smiling 
with his eyes fixed on her face does nothing occur to you 
do not you recollect harriet smith 
her cheeks flushed at the name and she felt afraid of something 
though she knew not what 
have you heard from her yourself this morning cried he 
you have i believe and know the whole 
no i have not i know nothing pray tell me 
you are prepared for the worst i see and very bad it is 
harriet smith marries robert martin 
emma gave a start which did not seem like being prepared 
and her eyes in eager gaze said no this is impossible 
but her lips were closed 
it is so indeed continued mr knightley i have it from robert 
martin himself he left me not half an hour ago 
she was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement 
you like it my emma as little as i feared i wish our opinions were 
the same but in time they will time you may be sure will make 
one or the other of us think differently and in the meanwhile 
we need not talk much on the subject 
you mistake me you quite mistake me she replied exerting herself 
it is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy 
but i cannot believe it it seems an impossibility you cannot mean 
to say that harriet smith has accepted robert martin you cannot 
mean that he has even proposed to her again yet you only mean 
that he intends it 
i mean that he has done it answered mr knightley with smiling 
but determined decision and been accepted 
good god she cried well then having recourse to her workbasket 
in excuse for leaning down her face and concealing all the 
exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she 
must be expressing she added well now tell me every thing 
make this intelligible to me how where when let me know it all 
i never was more surprized but it does not make me unhappy 
i assure you how how has it been possible 
it is a very simple story he went to town on business three days ago 
and i got him to take charge of some papers which i was wanting 
to send to john he delivered these papers to john at his chambers 
and was asked by him to join their party the same evening to astley s 
they were going to take the two eldest boys to astley s the party 
was to be our brother and sister henry john and miss smith 
my friend robert could not resist they called for him in their way 
were all extremely amused and my brother asked him to dine with 
them the next day which he did and in the course of that visit 
as i understand he found an opportunity of speaking to harriet 
and certainly did not speak in vain she made him by her acceptance 
as happy even as he is deserving he came down by yesterday s coach 
and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast to report 
his proceedings first on my affairs and then on his own 
this is all that i can relate of the how where and when 
your friend harriet will make a much longer history when you see her 
she will give you all the minute particulars which only woman s 
language can make interesting in our communications we deal only 
in the great however i must say that robert martin s heart seemed 
for him and to me very overflowing and that he did mention 
without its being much to the purpose that on quitting their 
box at astley s my brother took charge of mrs john knightley 
and little john and he followed with miss smith and henry 
and that at one time they were in such a crowd as to make miss smith 
rather uneasy 
he stopped emma dared not attempt any immediate reply to speak 
she was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree 
of happiness she must wait a moment or he would think her mad 
her silence disturbed him and after observing her a little while 
he added 
emma my love you said that this circumstance would not now make 
you unhappy but i am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected 
his situation is an evil but you must consider it as what satisfies 
your friend and i will answer for your thinking better and better 
of him as you know him more his good sense and good principles would 
delight you as far as the man is concerned you could not wish your 
friend in better hands his rank in society i would alter if i could 
which is saying a great deal i assure you emma you laugh at me 
about william larkins but i could quite as ill spare robert martin 
he wanted her to look up and smile and having now brought herself 
not to smile too broadly she did cheerfully answering 
you need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match i think 
harriet is doing extremely well her connexions may be worse than his 
in respectability of character there can be no doubt that they are 
i have been silent from surprize merely excessive surprize 
you cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me how peculiarly 
unprepared i was for i had reason to believe her very lately more 
determined against him much more than she was before 
you ought to know your friend best replied mr knightley 
but i should say she was a good tempered soft hearted girl 
not likely to be very very determined against any young man who told 
her he loved her 
emma could not help laughing as she answered upon my word 
i believe you know her quite as well as i do but mr knightley 
are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright 
accepted him i could suppose she might in time but can she already 
did not you misunderstand him you were both talking of other things 
of business shows of cattle or new drills and might not you 
in the confusion of so many subjects mistake him it was not 
harriet s hand that he was certain of it was the dimensions of some 
famous ox 
the contrast between the countenance and air of mr knightley and 
robert martin was at this moment so strong to emma s feelings 
and so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently 
passed on harriet s side so fresh the sound of those words 
spoken with such emphasis no i hope i know better than to think 
of robert martin that she was really expecting the intelligence 
to prove in some measure premature it could not be otherwise 
do you dare say this cried mr knightley do you dare to suppose 
me so great a blockhead as not to know what a man is talking of 
what do you deserve 
oh i always deserve the best treatment because i never put 
up with any other and therefore you must give me a plain 
direct answer are you quite sure that you understand the terms 
on which mr martin and harriet now are 
i am quite sure he replied speaking very distinctly that he 
told me she had accepted him and that there was no obscurity 
nothing doubtful in the words he used and i think i can give you 
a proof that it must be so he asked my opinion as to what he 
was now to do he knew of no one but mrs goddard to whom he 
could apply for information of her relations or friends could i 
mention any thing more fit to be done than to go to mrs goddard 
i assured him that i could not then he said he would endeavour 
to see her in the course of this day 
i am perfectly satisfied replied emma with the brightest smiles 
and most sincerely wish them happy 
you are materially changed since we talked on this subject before 
i hope so for at that time i was a fool 
and i am changed also for i am now very willing to grant you all 
harriet s good qualities i have taken some pains for your sake 
and for robert martin s sake whom i have always had reason to believe 
as much in love with her as ever to get acquainted with her 
i have often talked to her a good deal you must have seen that 
i did sometimes indeed i have thought you were half suspecting me 
of pleading poor martin s because which was never the case but from all 
my observations i am convinced of her being an artless amiable girl 
with very good notions very seriously good principles and placing 
her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life 
much of this i have no doubt she may thank you for 
me cried emma shaking her head ah poor harriet 
she checked herself however and submitted quietly to a little 
more praise than she deserved 
their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of 
her father she was not sorry she wanted to be alone her mind 
was in a state of flutter and wonder which made it impossible for her 
to be collected she was in dancing singing exclaiming spirits 
and till she had moved about and talked to herself and laughed 
and reflected she could be fit for nothing rational 
her father s business was to announce james s being gone out to put 
the horses to preparatory to their now daily drive to randalls 
and she had therefore an immediate excuse for disappearing 
the joy the gratitude the exquisite delight of her sensations 
may be imagined the sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the 
prospect of harriet s welfare she was really in danger of becoming 
too happy for security what had she to wish for nothing but to 
grow more worthy of him whose intentions and judgment had been 
ever so superior to her own nothing but that the lessons 
of her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future 
serious she was very serious in her thankfulness and in her resolutions 
and yet there was no preventing a laugh sometimes in the very midst 
of them she must laugh at such a close such an end of the doleful 
disappointment of five weeks back such a heart such a harriet 
now there would be pleasure in her returning every thing would 
be a pleasure it would be a great pleasure to know robert martin 
high in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities 
was the reflection that all necessity of concealment from 
mr knightley would soon be over the disguise equivocation 
mystery so hateful to her to practise might soon be over 
she could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect 
confidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty 
in the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father 
not always listening but always agreeing to what he said 
and whether in speech or silence conniving at the comfortable 
persuasion of his being obliged to go to randalls every day 
or poor mrs weston would be disappointed 
they arrived mrs weston was alone in the drawing room 
but hardly had they been told of the baby and mr woodhouse 
received the thanks for coming which he asked for when a glimpse 
was caught through the blind of two figures passing near the window 
it is frank and miss fairfax said mrs weston i was just 
going to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive 
this morning he stays till to morrow and miss fairfax has been 
persuaded to spend the day with us they are coming in i hope 
in half a minute they were in the room emma was extremely glad 
to see him but there was a degree of confusion a number of 
embarrassing recollections on each side they met readily and smiling 
but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said 
and having all sat down again there was for some time such a blank 
in the circle that emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged 
which she had long felt of seeing frank churchill once more 
and of seeing him with jane would yield its proportion of pleasure 
when mr weston joined the party however and when the baby 
was fetched there was no longer a want of subject or animation 
or of courage and opportunity for frank churchill to draw near her 
and say 
i have to thank you miss woodhouse for a very kind forgiving 
message in one of mrs weston s letters i hope time has not made 
you less willing to pardon i hope you do not retract what you 
then said 
no indeed cried emma most happy to begin not in the least 
i am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you and to give 
you joy in person 
he thanked her with all his heart and continued some time to speak 
with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness 
is not she looking well said he turning his eyes towards jane 
better than she ever used to do you see how my father and 
mrs weston doat upon her 
but his spirits were soon rising again and with laughing eyes 
after mentioning the expected return of the campbells he named 
the name of dixon emma blushed and forbade its being pronounced 
in her hearing 
i can never think of it she cried without extreme shame 
the shame he answered is all mine or ought to be but is it 
possible that you had no suspicion i mean of late early i know 
you had none 
i never had the smallest i assure you 
that appears quite wonderful i was once very near and i wish i had 
it would have been better but though i was always doing wrong things 
they were very bad wrong things and such as did me no service 
it would have been a much better transgression had i broken the bond 
of secrecy and told you every thing 
it is not now worth a regret said emma 
i have some hope resumed he of my uncle s being persuaded 
to pay a visit at randalls he wants to be introduced to her 
when the campbells are returned we shall meet them in london 
and continue there i trust till we may carry her northward but now 
i am at such a distance from her is not it hard miss woodhouse 
till this morning we have not once met since the day of reconciliation 
do not you pity me 
emma spoke her pity so very kindly that with a sudden accession 
of gay thought he cried 
ah by the bye then sinking his voice and looking demure for 
the moment i hope mr knightley is well he paused she coloured 
and laughed i know you saw my letter and think you may remember 
my wish in your favour let me return your congratulations 
i assure you that i have heard the news with the warmest interest 
and satisfaction he is a man whom i cannot presume to praise 
emma was delighted and only wanted him to go on in the same style 
but his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his 
own jane and his next words were 
did you ever see such a skin such smoothness such delicacy 
and yet without being actually fair one cannot call her fair 
it is a most uncommon complexion with her dark eye lashes and hair 
a most distinguishing complexion so peculiarly the lady in it 
just colour enough for beauty 
i have always admired her complexion replied emma archly but do not 
i remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale 
when we first began to talk of her have you quite forgotten 
oh no what an impudent dog i was how could i dare 
but he laughed so heartily at the recollection that emma could 
not help saying 
i do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time 
you had very great amusement in tricking us all i am sure you had 
i am sure it was a consolation to you 
oh no no no how can you suspect me of such a thing 
i was the most miserable wretch 
not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth i am sure it 
was a source of high entertainment to you to feel that you were taking 
us all in perhaps i am the readier to suspect because to tell 
you the truth i think it might have been some amusement to myself 
in the same situation i think there is a little likeness between us 
he bowed 
if not in our dispositions she presently added with a look of 
true sensibility there is a likeness in our destiny the destiny 
which bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior 
to our own 
true true he answered warmly no not true on your side you can 
have no superior but most true on mine she is a complete angel 
look at her is not she an angel in every gesture observe the turn 
of her throat observe her eyes as she is looking up at my father 
you will be glad to hear inclining his head and whispering seriously 
that my uncle means to give her all my aunt s jewels they are to be 
new set i am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head 
will not it be beautiful in her dark hair 
very beautiful indeed replied emma and she spoke so kindly 
that he gratefully burst out 
how delighted i am to see you again and to see you in such 
excellent looks i would not have missed this meeting for the world 
i should certainly have called at hartfield had you failed to come 
the others had been talking of the child mrs weston giving an 
account of a little alarm she had been under the evening before 
from the infant s appearing not quite well she believed she had 
been foolish but it had alarmed her and she had been within half 
a minute of sending for mr perry perhaps she ought to be ashamed 
but mr weston had been almost as uneasy as herself in ten minutes 
however the child had been perfectly well again this was 
her history and particularly interesting it was to mr woodhouse 
who commended her very much for thinking of sending for perry 
and only regretted that she had not done it she should always send 
for perry if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered 
were it only for a moment she could not be too soon alarmed 
nor send for perry too often it was a pity perhaps that he 
had not come last night for though the child seemed well now 
very well considering it would probably have been better if perry 
had seen it 
frank churchill caught the name 
perry said he to emma and trying as he spoke to catch miss 
fairfax s eye my friend mr perry what are they saying 
about mr perry has he been here this morning and how does 
he travel now has he set up his carriage 
emma soon recollected and understood him and while she joined 
in the laugh it was evident from jane s countenance that she 
too was really hearing him though trying to seem deaf 
such an extraordinary dream of mine he cried i can never think 
of it without laughing she hears us she hears us miss woodhouse 
i see it in her cheek her smile her vain attempt to frown 
look at her do not you see that at this instant the very passage 
of her own letter which sent me the report is passing under her eye 
that the whole blunder is spread before her that she can attend to 
nothing else though pretending to listen to the others 
jane was forced to smile completely for a moment and the smile 
partly remained as she turned towards him and said in a conscious 
low yet steady voice 
how you can bear such recollections is astonishing to me 
they will sometimes obtrude but how you can court them 
he had a great deal to say in return and very entertainingly 
but emma s feelings were chiefly with jane in the argument and on 
leaving randalls and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men 
she felt that pleased as she had been to see frank churchill 
and really regarding him as she did with friendship she had never 
been more sensible of mr knightley s high superiority of character 
the happiness of this most happy day received its completion in the 
animated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced 
chapter xix 
if emma had still at intervals an anxious feeling for harriet 
a momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured 
of her attachment to mr knightley and really able to accept 
another man from unbiased inclination it was not long that she 
had to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty 
a very few days brought the party from london and she had no 
sooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with harriet 
than she became perfectly satisfied unaccountable as it was 
that robert martin had thoroughly supplanted mr knightley 
and was now forming all her views of happiness 
harriet was a little distressed did look a little foolish at first 
but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly 
and self deceived before her pain and confusion seemed to die 
away with the words and leave her without a care for the past 
and with the fullest exultation in the present and future for as to 
her friend s approbation emma had instantly removed every fear of 
that nature by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations 
harriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at 
astley s and the dinner the next day she could dwell on it all 
with the utmost delight but what did such particulars explain 
the fact was as emma could now acknowledge that harriet had 
always liked robert martin and that his continuing to love her had 
been irresistible beyond this it must ever be unintelligible 
to emma 
the event however was most joyful and every day was giving her 
fresh reason for thinking so harriet s parentage became known 
she proved to be the daughter of a tradesman rich enough to afford 
her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers and decent 
enough to have always wished for concealment such was the blood 
of gentility which emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for 
it was likely to be as untainted perhaps as the blood of many 
a gentleman but what a connexion had she been preparing for 
mr knightley or for the churchills or even for mr elton 
the stain of illegitimacy unbleached by nobility or wealth 
would have been a stain indeed 
no objection was raised on the father s side the young man was 
treated liberally it was all as it should be and as emma became 
acquainted with robert martin who was now introduced at hartfield 
she fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth 
which could bid fairest for her little friend she had no doubt 
of harriet s happiness with any good tempered man but with him 
and in the home he offered there would be the hope of more 
of security stability and improvement she would be placed in the 
midst of those who loved her and who had better sense than herself 
retired enough for safety and occupied enough for cheerfulness 
she would be never led into temptation nor left for it to find her out 
she would be respectable and happy and emma admitted her to be 
the luckiest creature in the world to have created so steady and 
persevering an affection in such a man or if not quite the luckiest 
to yield only to herself 
harriet necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the martins 
was less and less at hartfield which was not to be regretted 
the intimacy between her and emma must sink their friendship must 
change into a calmer sort of goodwill and fortunately what ought 
to be and must be seemed already beginning and in the most gradual 
natural manner 
before the end of september emma attended harriet to church and saw 
her hand bestowed on robert martin with so complete a satisfaction 
as no remembrances even connected with mr elton as he stood 
before them could impair perhaps indeed at that time she 
scarcely saw mr elton but as the clergyman whose blessing at the 
altar might next fall on herself robert martin and harriet smith 
the latest couple engaged of the three were the first to be married 
jane fairfax had already quitted highbury and was restored to the 
comforts of her beloved home with the campbells the mr churchills 
were also in town and they were only waiting for november 
the intermediate month was the one fixed on as far as they dared 
by emma and mr knightley they had determined that their marriage 
ought to be concluded while john and isabella were still at hartfield 
to allow them the fortnight s absence in a tour to the seaside 
which was the plan john and isabella and every other friend 
were agreed in approving it but mr woodhouse how was mr woodhouse 
to be induced to consent he who had never yet alluded to their 
marriage but as a distant event 
when first sounded on the subject he was so miserable that they 
were almost hopeless a second allusion indeed gave less pain 
he began to think it was to be and that he could not prevent it 
a very promising step of the mind on its way to resignation 
still however he was not happy nay he appeared so much otherwise 
that his daughter s courage failed she could not bear to see 
him suffering to know him fancying himself neglected and though 
her understanding almost acquiesced in the assurance of both the 
mr knightleys that when once the event were over his distress 
would be soon over too she hesitated she could not proceed 
in this state of suspense they were befriended not by any sudden 
illumination of mr woodhouse s mind or any wonderful change of his 
nervous system but by the operation of the same system in another way 
mrs weston s poultry house was robbed one night of all her turkeys 
evidently by the ingenuity of man other poultry yards in the 
neighbourhood also suffered pilfering was housebreaking to 
mr woodhouse s fears he was very uneasy and but for the sense 
of his son in law s protection would have been under wretched alarm 
every night of his life the strength resolution and presence 
of mind of the mr knightleys commanded his fullest dependence 
while either of them protected him and his hartfield was safe 
but mr john knightley must be in london again by the end of the 
first week in november 
the result of this distress was that with a much more voluntary 
cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at 
the moment she was able to fix her wedding day and mr elton was 
called on within a month from the marriage of mr and mrs robert 
martin to join the hands of mr knightley and miss woodhouse 
the wedding was very much like other weddings where the parties 
have no taste for finery or parade and mrs elton from the 
particulars detailed by her husband thought it all extremely shabby 
and very inferior to her own very little white satin very few 
lace veils a most pitiful business selina would stare when she 
heard of it but in spite of these deficiencies the wishes 
the hopes the confidence the predictions of the small band 
of true friends who witnessed the ceremony were fully answered 
in the perfect happiness of the union

persuasion by jane austen 
chapter 
sir walter elliot of kellynch hall in somersetshire was a man who 
for his own amusement never took up any book but the baronetage 
there he found occupation for an idle hour and consolation in a 
distressed one there his faculties were roused into admiration and 
respect by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents 
there any unwelcome sensations arising from domestic affairs 
changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over 
the almost endless creations of the last century and there 
if every other leaf were powerless he could read his own history 
with an interest which never failed this was the page at which 
the favourite volume always opened 
elliot of kellynch hall 
walter elliot born march married july elizabeth 
daughter of james stevenson esq of south park in the county of 
gloucester by which lady who died he has issue elizabeth 
born june anne born august a still born son 
november mary born november 
precisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer s hands 
but sir walter had improved it by adding for the information of 
himself and his family these words after the date of mary s birth 
married december charles son and heir of charles 
musgrove esq of uppercross in the county of somerset 
and by inserting most accurately the day of the month on which 
he had lost his wife 
then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family 
in the usual terms how it had been first settled in cheshire 
how mentioned in dugdale serving the office of high sheriff 
representing a borough in three successive parliaments 
exertions of loyalty and dignity of baronet in the first year 
of charles ii with all the marys and elizabeths they had married 
forming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages and concluding with 
the arms and motto principal seat kellynch hall in the county 
of somerset and sir walter s handwriting again in this finale 
heir presumptive william walter elliot esq great grandson of 
the second sir walter 
vanity was the beginning and the end of sir walter elliot s character 
vanity of person and of situation he had been remarkably handsome 
in his youth and at fifty four was still a very fine man 
few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did 
nor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with 
the place he held in society he considered the blessing of beauty 
as inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy and the sir walter elliot 
who united these gifts was the constant object of his warmest respect 
and devotion 
his good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment 
since to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character 
to any thing deserved by his own lady elliot had been an excellent woman 
sensible and amiable whose judgement and conduct if they might be 
pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her lady elliot 
had never required indulgence afterwards she had humoured 
or softened or concealed his failings and promoted his real 
respectability for seventeen years and though not the very happiest 
being in the world herself had found enough in her duties her friends 
and her children to attach her to life and make it no matter of 
indifference to her when she was called on to quit them 
three girls the two eldest sixteen and fourteen was an awful legacy 
for a mother to bequeath an awful charge rather to confide to 
the authority and guidance of a conceited silly father 
she had however one very intimate friend a sensible deserving woman 
who had been brought by strong attachment to herself to settle 
close by her in the village of kellynch and on her kindness and advice 
lady elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of 
the good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously 
giving her daughters 
this friend and sir walter did not marry whatever might have been 
anticipated on that head by their acquaintance thirteen years 
had passed away since lady elliot s death and they were still 
near neighbours and intimate friends and one remained a widower 
the other a widow 
that lady russell of steady age and character and extremely 
well provided for should have no thought of a second marriage 
needs no apology to the public which is rather apt to be unreasonably 
discontented when a woman does marry again than when she does not 
but sir walter s continuing in singleness requires explanation 
be it known then that sir walter like a good father having met with 
one or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications 
prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters sake 
for one daughter his eldest he would really have given up any thing 
which he had not been very much tempted to do elizabeth had succeeded 
at sixteen to all that was possible of her mother s rights 
and consequence and being very handsome and very like himself 
her influence had always been great and they had gone on together 
most happily his two other children were of very inferior value 
mary had acquired a little artificial importance by becoming 
mrs charles musgrove but anne with an elegance of mind and sweetness 
of character which must have placed her high with any people 
of real understanding was nobody with either father or sister 
her word had no weight her convenience was always to give way 
she was only anne 
to lady russell indeed she was a most dear and highly valued 
god daughter favourite and friend lady russell loved them all 
but it was only in anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again 
a few years before anne elliot had been a very pretty girl 
but her bloom had vanished early and as even in its height 
her father had found little to admire in her so totally different 
were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own 
there could be nothing in them now that she was faded and thin 
to excite his esteem he had never indulged much hope he had now none 
of ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work 
all equality of alliance must rest with elizabeth for mary had merely 
connected herself with an old country family of respectability and 
large fortune and had therefore given all the honour and received none 
elizabeth would one day or other marry suitably 
it sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty nine than 
she was ten years before and generally speaking if there has been 
neither ill health nor anxiety it is a time of life at which scarcely any 
charm is lost it was so with elizabeth still the same handsome 
miss elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago and sir walter 
might be excused therefore in forgetting her age or at least 
be deemed only half a fool for thinking himself and elizabeth 
as blooming as ever amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else 
for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and 
acquaintance were growing anne haggard mary coarse every face 
in the neighbourhood worsting and the rapid increase of the crow s foot 
about lady russell s temples had long been a distress to him 
elizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment 
thirteen years had seen her mistress of kellynch hall presiding and 
directing with a self possession and decision which could never have given 
the idea of her being younger than she was for thirteen years had 
she been doing the honours and laying down the domestic law at home 
and leading the way to the chaise and four and walking immediately after 
lady russell out of all the drawing rooms and dining rooms in the country 
thirteen winters revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball 
of credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded and thirteen springs 
shewn their blossoms as she travelled up to london with her father 
for a few weeks annual enjoyment of the great world she had 
the remembrance of all this she had the consciousness of being 
nine and twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions 
she was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever 
but she felt her approach to the years of danger and would have rejoiced 
to be certain of being properly solicited by baronet blood within 
the next twelvemonth or two then might she again take up 
the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth 
but now she liked it not always to be presented with the date of 
her own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister 
made the book an evil and more than once when her father had left it 
open on the table near her had she closed it with averted eyes 
and pushed it away 
she had had a disappointment moreover which that book 
and especially the history of her own family must ever present 
the remembrance of the heir presumptive the very william walter 
elliot esq whose rights had been so generously supported 
by her father had disappointed her 
she had while a very young girl as soon as she had known him to be 
in the event of her having no brother the future baronet 
meant to marry him and her father had always meant that she should 
he had not been known to them as a boy but soon after lady elliot s death 
sir walter had sought the acquaintance and though his overtures 
had not been met with any warmth he had persevered in seeking it 
making allowance for the modest drawing back of youth and in one of 
their spring excursions to london when elizabeth was in her first bloom 
mr elliot had been forced into the introduction 
he was at that time a very young man just engaged in the study of the law 
and elizabeth found him extremely agreeable and every plan in his favour 
was confirmed he was invited to kellynch hall he was talked of 
and expected all the rest of the year but he never came 
the following spring he was seen again in town found equally agreeable 
again encouraged invited and expected and again he did not come 
and the next tidings were that he was married instead of pushing 
his fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of elliot 
he had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman 
of inferior birth 
sir walter has resented it as the head of the house he felt that 
he ought to have been consulted especially after taking the young man 
so publicly by the hand for they must have been seen together 
he observed once at tattersall s and twice in the lobby of 
the house of commons his disapprobation was expressed 
but apparently very little regarded mr elliot had attempted no apology 
and shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family 
as sir walter considered him unworthy of it all acquaintance between 
them had ceased 
this very awkward history of mr elliot was still after an interval 
of several years felt with anger by elizabeth who had liked the man 
for himself and still more for being her father s heir and whose 
strong family pride could see only in him a proper match for sir walter 
elliot s eldest daughter there was not a baronet from a to z whom 
her feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal 
yet so miserably had he conducted himself that though she was 
at this present time the summer of wearing black ribbons 
for his wife she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again 
the disgrace of his first marriage might perhaps as there was 
no reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring have been got over 
had he not done worse but he had as by the accustomary intervention 
of kind friends they had been informed spoken most disrespectfully 
of them all most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood 
he belonged to and the honours which were hereafter to be his own 
this could not be pardoned 
such were elizabeth elliot s sentiments and sensations such the cares 
to alloy the agitations to vary the sameness and the elegance 
the prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life 
such the feelings to give interest to a long uneventful residence 
in one country circle to fill the vacancies which there were no habits 
of utility abroad no talents or accomplishments for home to occupy 
but now another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be 
added to these her father was growing distressed for money 
she knew that when he now took up the baronetage it was to drive 
the heavy bills of his tradespeople and the unwelcome hints of 
mr shepherd his agent from his thoughts the kellynch property was good 
but not equal to sir walter s apprehension of the state required 
in its possessor while lady elliot lived there had been method 
moderation and economy which had just kept him within his income 
but with her had died all such right mindedness and from that period 
he had been constantly exceeding it it had not been possible 
for him to spend less he had done nothing but what sir walter elliot 
was imperiously called on to do but blameless as he was he was 
not only growing dreadfully in debt but was hearing of it so often 
that it became vain to attempt concealing it longer even partially 
from his daughter he had given her some hints of it the last spring 
in town he had gone so far even as to say can we retrench 
does it occur to you that there is any one article in which 
we can retrench and elizabeth to do her justice had in the first 
ardour of female alarm set seriously to think what could be done 
and had finally proposed these two branches of economy to cut off 
some unnecessary charities and to refrain from new furnishing 
the drawing room to which expedients she afterwards added 
the happy thought of their taking no present down to anne 
as had been the usual yearly custom but these measures 
however good in themselves were insufficient for the real extent 
of the evil the whole of which sir walter found himself obliged 
to confess to her soon afterwards elizabeth had nothing to propose 
of deeper efficacy she felt herself ill used and unfortunate 
as did her father and they were neither of them able to devise 
any means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity 
or relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne 
there was only a small part of his estate that sir walter could dispose of 
but had every acre been alienable it would have made no difference 
he had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the power 
but he would never condescend to sell no he would never disgrace 
his name so far the kellynch estate should be transmitted whole 
and entire as he had received it 
their two confidential friends mr shepherd who lived in 
the neighbouring market town and lady russell were called to advise them 
and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be 
struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments 
and reduce their expenditure without involving the loss of 
any indulgence of taste or pride 
chapter 
mr shepherd a civil cautious lawyer who whatever might be his hold 
or his views on sir walter would rather have the disagreeable 
prompted by anybody else excused himself from offering the slightest hint 
and only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to 
the excellent judgement of lady russell from whose known good sense 
he fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as 
he meant to see finally adopted 
lady russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject and gave it 
much serious consideration she was a woman rather of sound than of 
quick abilities whose difficulties in coming to any decision 
in this instance were great from the opposition of two leading principles 
she was of strict integrity herself with a delicate sense of honour 
but she was as desirous of saving sir walter s feelings as solicitous 
for the credit of the family as aristocratic in her ideas of what 
was due to them as anybody of sense and honesty could well be 
she was a benevolent charitable good woman and capable of 
strong attachments most correct in her conduct strict in her notions 
of decorum and with manners that were held a standard of good breeding 
she had a cultivated mind and was generally speaking 
rational and consistent but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry 
she had a value for rank and consequence which blinded her a little 
to the faults of those who possessed them herself the widow of 
only a knight she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due 
and sir walter independent of his claims as an old acquaintance 
an attentive neighbour an obliging landlord the husband of her 
very dear friend the father of anne and her sisters was 
as being sir walter in her apprehension entitled to a great deal 
of compassion and consideration under his present difficulties 
they must retrench that did not admit of a doubt but she was 
very anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him 
and elizabeth she drew up plans of economy she made exact calculations 
and she did what nobody else thought of doing she consulted anne 
who never seemed considered by the others as having any interest 
in the question she consulted and in a degree was influenced by her 
in marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted 
to sir walter every emendation of anne s had been on the side of 
honesty against importance she wanted more vigorous measures 
a more complete reformation a quicker release from debt 
a much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity 
if we can persuade your father to all this said lady russell 
looking over her paper much may be done if he will adopt 
these regulations in seven years he will be clear and i hope 
we may be able to convince him and elizabeth that kellynch hall has 
a respectability in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions 
and that the true dignity of sir walter elliot will be very far from 
lessened in the eyes of sensible people by acting like a man of principle 
what will he be doing in fact but what very many of our first families 
have done or ought to do there will be nothing singular in his case 
and it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering 
as it always does of our conduct i have great hope of prevailing 
we must be serious and decided for after all the person who 
has contracted debts must pay them and though a great deal is due to 
the feelings of the gentleman and the head of a house like your father 
there is still more due to the character of an honest man 
this was the principle on which anne wanted her father to be proceeding 
his friends to be urging him she considered it as an act 
of indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with 
all the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments 
could secure and saw no dignity in anything short of it 
she wanted it to be prescribed and felt as a duty she rated 
lady russell s influence highly and as to the severe degree 
of self denial which her own conscience prompted she believed 
there might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete 
than to half a reformation her knowledge of her father 
and elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair 
of horses would be hardly less painful than of both and so on 
through the whole list of lady russell s too gentle reductions 
how anne s more rigid requisitions might have been taken 
is of little consequence lady russell s had no success at all 
could not be put up with were not to be borne what every comfort 
of life knocked off journeys london servants horses table 
contractions and restrictions every where to live no longer 
with the decencies even of a private gentleman no he would sooner 
quit kellynch hall at once than remain in it on such disgraceful terms 
quit kellynch hall the hint was immediately taken up by mr shepherd 
whose interest was involved in the reality of sir walter s retrenching 
and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without 
a change of abode since the idea had been started in the very quarter 
which ought to dictate he had no scruple he said in confessing 
his judgement to be entirely on that side it did not appear to him 
that sir walter could materially alter his style of living in a house 
which had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support 
in any other place sir walter might judge for himself and would 
be looked up to as regulating the modes of life in whatever way 
he might choose to model his household 
sir walter would quit kellynch hall and after a very few days more 
of doubt and indecision the great question of whither he should go 
was settled and the first outline of this important change made out 
there had been three alternatives london bath or another house 
in the country all anne s wishes had been for the latter 
a small house in their own neighbourhood where they might still have 
lady russell s society still be near mary and still have the pleasure 
of sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of kellynch was the object 
of her ambition but the usual fate of anne attended her 
in having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on 
she disliked bath and did not think it agreed with her 
and bath was to be her home 
sir walter had at first thought more of london but mr shepherd felt 
that he could not be trusted in london and had been skilful enough 
to dissuade him from it and make bath preferred it was a much safer 
place for a gentleman in his predicament he might there be important 
at comparatively little expense two material advantages of bath 
over london had of course been given all their weight its more convenient 
distance from kellynch only fifty miles and lady russell s spending 
some part of every winter there and to the very great satisfaction 
of lady russell whose first views on the projected change had been 
for bath sir walter and elizabeth were induced to believe that 
they should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there 
lady russell felt obliged to oppose her dear anne s known wishes 
it would be too much to expect sir walter to descend into a small house 
in his own neighbourhood anne herself would have found 
the mortifications of it more than she foresaw and to sir walter s 
feelings they must have been dreadful and with regard to anne s 
dislike of bath she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising 
first from the circumstance of her having been three years 
at school there after her mother s death and secondly 
from her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter 
which she had afterwards spent there with herself 
lady russell was fond of bath in short and disposed to think 
it must suit them all and as to her young friend s health 
by passing all the warm months with her at kellynch lodge 
every danger would be avoided and it was in fact a change which must 
do both health and spirits good anne had been too little from home 
too little seen her spirits were not high a larger society 
would improve them she wanted her to be more known 
the undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood 
for sir walter was certainly much strengthened by one part 
and a very material part of the scheme which had been happily 
engrafted on the beginning he was not only to quit his home 
but to see it in the hands of others a trial of fortitude 
which stronger heads than sir walter s have found too much 
kellynch hall was to be let this however was a profound secret 
not to be breathed beyond their own circle 
sir walter could not have borne the degradation of being known 
to design letting his house mr shepherd had once mentioned the word 
advertise but never dared approach it again sir walter spurned 
the idea of its being offered in any manner forbad the slightest hint 
being dropped of his having such an intention and it was only on 
the supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most 
unexceptionable applicant on his own terms and as a great favour 
that he would let it at all 
how quick come the reasons for approving what we like lady russell had 
another excellent one at hand for being extremely glad that sir walter 
and his family were to remove from the country elizabeth had been 
lately forming an intimacy which she wished to see interrupted 
it was with the daughter of mr shepherd who had returned 
after an unprosperous marriage to her father s house with 
the additional burden of two children she was a clever young woman 
who understood the art of pleasing the art of pleasing at least 
at kellynch hall and who had made herself so acceptable to miss elliot 
as to have been already staying there more than once in spite of all 
that lady russell who thought it a friendship quite out of place 
could hint of caution and reserve 
lady russell indeed had scarcely any influence with elizabeth 
and seemed to love her rather because she would love her 
than because elizabeth deserved it she had never received from her more 
than outward attention nothing beyond the observances of complaisance 
had never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry 
against previous inclination she had been repeatedly very earnest 
in trying to get anne included in the visit to london sensibly open 
to all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements 
which shut her out and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured 
to give elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience 
but always in vain elizabeth would go her own way and never had she 
pursued it in more decided opposition to lady russell than in 
this selection of mrs clay turning from the society of so deserving 
a sister to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought 
to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility 
from situation mrs clay was in lady russell s estimate a very unequal 
and in her character she believed a very dangerous companion 
and a removal that would leave mrs clay behind and bring a choice 
of more suitable intimates within miss elliot s reach was therefore 
an object of first rate importance 
chapter 
i must take leave to observe sir walter said mr shepherd 
one morning at kellynch hall as he laid down the newspaper 
that the present juncture is much in our favour this peace will 
be turning all our rich naval officers ashore they will be 
all wanting a home could not be a better time sir walter 
for having a choice of tenants very responsible tenants 
many a noble fortune has been made during the war if a rich admiral 
were to come in our way sir walter 
he would be a very lucky man shepherd replied sir walter 
that is all i have to remark a prize indeed would kellynch hall 
be to him rather the greatest prize of all let him have taken 
ever so many before hey shepherd 
mr shepherd laughed as he knew he must at this wit and then added 
i presume to observe sir walter that in the way of business 
gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with i have had a little knowledge 
of their methods of doing business and i am free to confess that they 
have very liberal notions and are as likely to make desirable tenants 
as any set of people one should meet with therefore sir walter 
what i would take leave to suggest is that if in consequence of 
any rumours getting abroad of your intention which must be contemplated 
as a possible thing because we know how difficult it is to keep 
the actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice 
and curiosity of the other consequence has its tax i john shepherd 
might conceal any family matters that i chose for nobody would think it 
worth their while to observe me but sir walter elliot has eyes upon him 
which it may be very difficult to elude and therefore thus much 
i venture upon that it will not greatly surprise me if 
with all our caution some rumour of the truth should get abroad 
in the supposition of which as i was going to observe since applications 
will unquestionably follow i should think any from our wealthy 
naval commanders particularly worth attending to and beg leave to add 
that two hours will bring me over at any time to save you 
the trouble of replying 
sir walter only nodded but soon afterwards rising and pacing the room 
he observed sarcastically 
there are few among the gentlemen of the navy i imagine who would 
not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description 
they would look around them no doubt and bless their good fortune 
said mrs clay for mrs clay was present her father had driven her over 
nothing being of so much use to mrs clay s health as a drive to kellynch 
but i quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be 
a very desirable tenant i have known a good deal of the profession 
and besides their liberality they are so neat and careful 
in all their ways these valuable pictures of yours sir walter 
if you chose to leave them would be perfectly safe everything in 
and about the house would be taken such excellent care of 
the gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order 
as they are now you need not be afraid miss elliot of your own 
sweet flower gardens being neglected 
as to all that rejoined sir walter coolly supposing i were induced 
to let my house i have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges 
to be annexed to it i am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant 
the park would be open to him of course and few navy officers 
or men of any other description can have had such a range 
but what restrictions i might impose on the use of the pleasure grounds 
is another thing i am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being 
always approachable and i should recommend miss elliot to be on her guard 
with respect to her flower garden i am very little disposed 
to grant a tenant of kellynch hall any extraordinary favour 
i assure you be he sailor or soldier 
after a short pause mr shepherd presumed to say 
in all these cases there are established usages which 
make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant 
your interest sir walter is in pretty safe hands depend upon me 
for taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights 
i venture to hint that sir walter elliot cannot be half so jealous 
for his own as john shepherd will be for him 
here anne spoke 
the navy i think who have done so much for us have at least 
an equal claim with any other set of men for all the comforts and 
all the privileges which any home can give sailors work hard enough 
for their comforts we must all allow 
very true very true what miss anne says is very true 
was mr shepherd s rejoinder and oh certainly was his daughter s 
but sir walter s remark was soon afterwards 
the profession has its utility but i should be sorry to see 
any friend of mine belonging to it 
indeed was the reply and with a look of surprise 
yes it is in two points offensive to me i have two strong grounds 
of objection to it first as being the means of bringing persons 
of obscure birth into undue distinction and raising men to honours 
which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of and secondly 
as it cuts up a man s youth and vigour most horribly a sailor grows old 
sooner than any other man i have observed it all my life 
a man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise 
of one whose father his father might have disdained to speak to 
and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself than in 
any other line one day last spring in town i was in company 
with two men striking instances of what i am talking of 
lord st ives whose father we all know to have been a country curate 
without bread to eat i was to give place to lord st ives 
and a certain admiral baldwin the most deplorable looking personage 
you can imagine his face the colour of mahogany rough and rugged 
to the last degree all lines and wrinkles nine grey hairs of a side 
and nothing but a dab of powder at top in the name of heaven 
who is that old fellow said i to a friend of mine who was standing near 
sir basil morley old fellow cried sir basil it is admiral baldwin 
what do you take his age to be sixty said i or perhaps sixty two 
forty replied sir basil forty and no more picture to yourselves 
my amazement i shall not easily forget admiral baldwin 
i never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea faring life can do 
but to a degree i know it is the same with them all they are all 
knocked about and exposed to every climate and every weather 
till they are not fit to be seen it is a pity they are not knocked 
on the head at once before they reach admiral baldwin s age 
nay sir walter cried mrs clay this is being severe indeed 
have a little mercy on the poor men we are not all born to be handsome 
the sea is no beautifier certainly sailors do grow old betimes 
i have observed it they soon lose the look of youth but then 
is not it the same with many other professions perhaps most other 
soldiers in active service are not at all better off and even in 
the quieter professions there is a toil and a labour of the mind 
if not of the body which seldom leaves a man s looks to the natural 
effect of time the lawyer plods quite care worn the physician 
is up at all hours and travelling in all weather and even 
the clergyman she stopt a moment to consider what might 
do for the clergyman and even the clergyman you know is obliged 
to go into infected rooms and expose his health and looks to 
all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere in fact as i have 
long been convinced though every profession is necessary and honourable 
in its turn it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any 
who can live in a regular way in the country choosing their own hours 
following their own pursuits and living on their own property 
without the torment of trying for more it is only their lot i say 
to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost 
i know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness 
when they cease to be quite young 
it seemed as if mr shepherd in this anxiety to bespeak 
sir walter s good will towards a naval officer as tenant 
had been gifted with foresight for the very first application 
for the house was from an admiral croft with whom he shortly afterwards 
fell into company in attending the quarter sessions at taunton and indeed 
he had received a hint of the admiral from a london correspondent 
by the report which he hastened over to kellynch to make 
admiral croft was a native of somersetshire who having acquired 
a very handsome fortune was wishing to settle in his own country 
and had come down to taunton in order to look at some advertised places 
in that immediate neighbourhood which however had not suited him 
that accidentally hearing it was just as he had foretold 
mr shepherd observed sir walter s concerns could not be kept a secret 
accidentally hearing of the possibility of kellynch hall being to let 
and understanding his mr shepherd s connection with the owner 
he had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries 
and had in the course of a pretty long conference expressed as strong 
an inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description 
could feel and given mr shepherd in his explicit account of himself 
every proof of his being a most responsible eligible tenant 
and who is admiral croft was sir walter s cold suspicious inquiry 
mr shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman s family 
and mentioned a place and anne after the little pause which followed 
added 
he is a rear admiral of the white he was in the trafalgar action 
and has been in the east indies since he was stationed there 
i believe several years 
then i take it for granted observed sir walter that his face 
is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery 
mr shepherd hastened to assure him that admiral croft was a very hale 
hearty well looking man a little weather beaten to be sure 
but not much and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour 
not likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms only wanted 
a comfortable home and to get into it as soon as possible 
knew he must pay for his convenience knew what rent a ready furnished 
house of that consequence might fetch should not have been surprised 
if sir walter had asked more had inquired about the manor 
would be glad of the deputation certainly but made no great point of it 
said he sometimes took out a gun but never killed quite the gentleman 
mr shepherd was eloquent on the subject pointing out all 
the circumstances of the admiral s family which made him 
peculiarly desirable as a tenant he was a married man 
and without children the very state to be wished for a house was 
never taken good care of mr shepherd observed without a lady 
he did not know whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering 
as much where there was no lady as where there were many children 
a lady without a family was the very best preserver of furniture 
in the world he had seen mrs croft too she was at taunton 
with the admiral and had been present almost all the time they were 
talking the matter over 
and a very well spoken genteel shrewd lady she seemed to be 
continued he asked more questions about the house and terms 
and taxes than the admiral himself and seemed more conversant 
with business and moreover sir walter i found she was not quite 
unconnected in this country any more than her husband that is to say 
she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once 
she told me so herself sister to the gentleman who lived 
a few years back at monkford bless me what was his name 
at this moment i cannot recollect his name though i have heard it so lately 
penelope my dear can you help me to the name of the gentleman 
who lived at monkford mrs croft s brother 
but mrs clay was talking so eagerly with miss elliot that she did not 
hear the appeal 
i have no conception whom you can mean shepherd i remember 
no gentleman resident at monkford since the time of old governor trent 
bless me how very odd i shall forget my own name soon i suppose 
a name that i am so very well acquainted with knew the gentleman 
so well by sight seen him a hundred times came to consult me once 
i remember about a trespass of one of his neighbours farmer s man 
breaking into his orchard wall torn down apples stolen 
caught in the fact and afterwards contrary to my judgement 
submitted to an amicable compromise very odd indeed 
after waiting another moment 
you mean mr wentworth i suppose said anne 
mr shepherd was all gratitude 
wentworth was the very name mr wentworth was the very man 
he had the curacy of monkford you know sir walter some time back 
for two or three years came there about the year i take it 
you remember him i am sure 
wentworth oh ay mr wentworth the curate of monkford 
you misled me by the term gentleman i thought you were speaking of 
some man of property mr wentworth was nobody i remember 
quite unconnected nothing to do with the strafford family 
one wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common 
as mr shepherd perceived that this connexion of the crofts did them 
no service with sir walter he mentioned it no more returning 
with all his zeal to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably 
in their favour their age and number and fortune the high idea 
they had formed of kellynch hall and extreme solicitude for 
the advantage of renting it making it appear as if they ranked 
nothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of sir walter elliot 
an extraordinary taste certainly could they have been supposed in 
the secret of sir walter s estimate of the dues of a tenant 
it succeeded however and though sir walter must ever look with 
an evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house and think them 
infinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms 
he was talked into allowing mr shepherd to proceed in the treaty 
and authorising him to wait on admiral croft who still remained 
at taunton and fix a day for the house being seen 
sir walter was not very wise but still he had experience enough 
of the world to feel that a more unobjectionable tenant 
in all essentials than admiral croft bid fair to be could hardly offer 
so far went his understanding and his vanity supplied a little 
additional soothing in the admiral s situation in life which was just 
high enough and not too high i have let my house to admiral croft 
would sound extremely well very much better than to any mere mr 
a mr save perhaps some half dozen in the nation always needs 
a note of explanation an admiral speaks his own consequence 
and at the same time can never make a baronet look small 
in all their dealings and intercourse sir walter elliot must ever 
have the precedence 
nothing could be done without a reference to elizabeth 
but her inclination was growing so strong for a removal 
that she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand 
and not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her 
mr shepherd was completely empowered to act and no sooner had 
such an end been reached than anne who had been a most attentive listener 
to the whole left the room to seek the comfort of cool air for her 
flushed cheeks and as she walked along a favourite grove said 
with a gentle sigh a few months more and he perhaps 
may be walking here 
chapter 
he was not mr wentworth the former curate of monkford 
however suspicious appearances may be but a captain frederick wentworth 
his brother who being made commander in consequence of the action 
off st domingo and not immediately employed had come into somersetshire 
in the summer of and having no parent living found a home 
for half a year at monkford he was at that time a remarkably fine 
young man with a great deal of intelligence spirit and brilliancy 
and anne an extremely pretty girl with gentleness modesty taste 
and feeling half the sum of attraction on either side might have 
been enough for he had nothing to do and she had hardly anybody to love 
but the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail 
they were gradually acquainted and when acquainted rapidly and 
deeply in love it would be difficult to say which had seen 
highest perfection in the other or which had been the happiest 
she in receiving his declarations and proposals or he in 
having them accepted 
a short period of exquisite felicity followed and but a short one 
troubles soon arose sir walter on being applied to without actually 
withholding his consent or saying it should never be gave it all 
the negative of great astonishment great coldness great silence 
and a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter 
he thought it a very degrading alliance and lady russell though with 
more tempered and pardonable pride received it as a most unfortunate one 
anne elliot with all her claims of birth beauty and mind 
to throw herself away at nineteen involve herself at nineteen 
in an engagement with a young man who had nothing but himself 
to recommend him and no hopes of attaining affluence but in the chances 
of a most uncertain profession and no connexions to secure 
even his farther rise in the profession would be indeed a throwing away 
which she grieved to think of anne elliot so young known to so few 
to be snatched off by a stranger without alliance or fortune 
or rather sunk by him into a state of most wearing anxious 
youth killing dependence it must not be if by any fair interference 
of friendship any representations from one who had almost a mother s love 
and mother s rights it would be prevented 
captain wentworth had no fortune he had been lucky in his profession 
but spending freely what had come freely had realized nothing 
but he was confident that he should soon be rich 
full of life and ardour he knew that he should soon have a ship 
and soon be on a station that would lead to everything he wanted 
he had always been lucky he knew he should be so still 
such confidence powerful in its own warmth and bewitching in 
the wit which often expressed it must have been enough for anne 
but lady russell saw it very differently his sanguine temper 
and fearlessness of mind operated very differently on her 
she saw in it but an aggravation of the evil it only added a 
dangerous character to himself he was brilliant he was headstrong 
lady russell had little taste for wit and of anything approaching 
to imprudence a horror she deprecated the connexion in every light 
such opposition as these feelings produced was more than 
anne could combat young and gentle as she was it might yet 
have been possible to withstand her father s ill will 
though unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her sister 
but lady russell whom she had always loved and relied on could not 
with such steadiness of opinion and such tenderness of manner 
be continually advising her in vain she was persuaded to believe 
the engagement a wrong thing indiscreet improper hardly capable 
of success and not deserving it but it was not a merely selfish caution 
under which she acted in putting an end to it had she not 
imagined herself consulting his good even more than her own 
she could hardly have given him up the belief of being prudent 
and self denying principally for his advantage was her chief consolation 
under the misery of a parting a final parting and every consolation 
was required for she had to encounter all the additional pain of opinions 
on his side totally unconvinced and unbending and of his feeling himself 
ill used by so forced a relinquishment he had left the country 
in consequence 
a few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance 
but not with a few months ended anne s share of suffering from it 
her attachment and regrets had for a long time clouded every 
enjoyment of youth and an early loss of bloom and spirits 
had been their lasting effect 
more than seven years were gone since this little history 
of sorrowful interest had reached its close and time had 
softened down much perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him 
but she had been too dependent on time alone no aid had been given 
in change of place except in one visit to bath soon after the rupture 
or in any novelty or enlargement of society no one had ever 
come within the kellynch circle who could bear a comparison with 
frederick wentworth as he stood in her memory no second attachment 
the only thoroughly natural happy and sufficient cure 
at her time of life had been possible to the nice tone of her mind 
the fastidiousness of her taste in the small limits of the society 
around them she had been solicited when about two and twenty 
to change her name by the young man who not long afterwards found 
a more willing mind in her younger sister and lady russell had 
lamented her refusal for charles musgrove was the eldest son of a man 
whose landed property and general importance were second in that country 
only to sir walter s and of good character and appearance 
and however lady russell might have asked yet for something more 
while anne was nineteen she would have rejoiced to see her at twenty two 
so respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of 
her father s house and settled so permanently near herself 
but in this case anne had left nothing for advice to do 
and though lady russell as satisfied as ever with her own discretion 
never wished the past undone she began now to have the anxiety 
which borders on hopelessness for anne s being tempted by some man 
of talents and independence to enter a state for which she held her 
to be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits 
they knew not each other s opinion either its constancy or its change 
on the one leading point of anne s conduct for the subject was never 
alluded to but anne at seven and twenty thought very differently 
from what she had been made to think at nineteen she did not blame 
lady russell she did not blame herself for having been guided by her 
but she felt that were any young person in similar circumstances 
to apply to her for counsel they would never receive any of such 
certain immediate wretchedness such uncertain future good 
she was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home 
and every anxiety attending his profession all their probable fears 
delays and disappointments she should yet have been a happier woman 
in maintaining the engagement than she had been in the sacrifice of it 
and this she fully believed had the usual share had even more than 
the usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs 
without reference to the actual results of their case which 
as it happened would have bestowed earlier prosperity than 
could be reasonably calculated on all his sanguine expectations 
all his confidence had been justified his genius and ardour 
had seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path 
he had very soon after their engagement ceased got employ 
and all that he had told her would follow had taken place 
he had distinguished himself and early gained the other step in rank 
and must now by successive captures have made a handsome fortune 
she had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority 
but she could not doubt his being rich and in favour of his constancy 
she had no reason to believe him married 
how eloquent could anne elliot have been how eloquent at least 
were her wishes on the side of early warm attachment and a cheerful 
confidence in futurity against that over anxious caution which 
seems to insult exertion and distrust providence she had been forced 
into prudence in her youth she learned romance as she grew older 
the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning 
with all these circumstances recollections and feelings 
she could not hear that captain wentworth s sister was likely 
to live at kellynch without a revival of former pain and many a stroll 
and many a sigh were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea 
she often told herself it was folly before she could harden her nerves 
sufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the crofts 
and their business no evil she was assisted however by that 
perfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness among the only three 
of her own friends in the secret of the past which seemed almost to deny 
any recollection of it she could do justice to the superiority 
of lady russell s motives in this over those of her father and elizabeth 
she could honour all the better feelings of her calmness 
but the general air of oblivion among them was highly important 
from whatever it sprung and in the event of admiral croft s really 
taking kellynch hall she rejoiced anew over the conviction which 
had always been most grateful to her of the past being known to 
those three only among her connexions by whom no syllable 
she believed would ever be whispered and in the trust that among his 
the brother only with whom he had been residing had received 
any information of their short lived engagement that brother had been 
long removed from the country and being a sensible man and moreover 
a single man at the time she had a fond dependence on no human creature s 
having heard of it from him 
the sister mrs croft had then been out of england accompanying 
her husband on a foreign station and her own sister mary 
had been at school while it all occurred and never admitted by 
the pride of some and the delicacy of others to the smallest knowledge 
of it afterwards 
with these supports she hoped that the acquaintance between herself 
and the crofts which with lady russell still resident in kellynch 
and mary fixed only three miles off must be anticipated 
need not involve any particular awkwardness 
chapter 
on the morning appointed for admiral and mrs croft s seeing kellynch hall 
anne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to lady russell s 
and keep out of the way till all was over when she found it most natural 
to be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them 
this meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory 
and decided the whole business at once each lady was previously 
well disposed for an agreement and saw nothing therefore 
but good manners in the other and with regard to the gentlemen 
there was such an hearty good humour such an open trusting liberality 
on the admiral s side as could not but influence sir walter 
who had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished 
behaviour by mr shepherd s assurances of his being known by report 
to the admiral as a model of good breeding 
the house and grounds and furniture were approved the crofts 
were approved terms time every thing and every body was right 
and mr shepherd s clerks were set to work without there having been 
a single preliminary difference to modify of all that 
this indenture sheweth 
sir walter without hesitation declared the admiral to be 
the best looking sailor he had ever met with and went so far as to say 
that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair 
he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where 
and the admiral with sympathetic cordiality observed to his wife 
as they drove back through the park i thought we should soon 
come to a deal my dear in spite of what they told us at taunton 
the baronet will never set the thames on fire but there seems to be 
no harm in him reciprocal compliments which would have been 
esteemed about equal 
the crofts were to have possession at michaelmas and as sir walter 
proposed removing to bath in the course of the preceding month 
there was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement 
lady russell convinced that anne would not be allowed to be of any use 
or any importance in the choice of the house which they were 
going to secure was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon 
and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might 
convey her to bath herself after christmas but having engagements 
of her own which must take her from kellynch for several weeks 
she was unable to give the full invitation she wished and anne 
though dreading the possible heats of september in all the white glare 
of bath and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad 
of the autumnal months in the country did not think that 
everything considered she wished to remain it would be most right 
and most wise and therefore must involve least suffering 
to go with the others 
something occurred however to give her a different duty 
mary often a little unwell and always thinking a great deal 
of her own complaints and always in the habit of claiming anne 
when anything was the matter was indisposed and foreseeing 
that she should not have a day s health all the autumn entreated 
or rather required her for it was hardly entreaty to come to 
uppercross cottage and bear her company as long as she should want her 
instead of going to bath 
i cannot possibly do without anne was mary s reasoning 
and elizabeth s reply was then i am sure anne had better stay 
for nobody will want her in bath 
to be claimed as a good though in an improper style is at least 
better than being rejected as no good at all and anne glad to 
be thought of some use glad to have anything marked out as a duty 
and certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country 
and her own dear country readily agreed to stay 
this invitation of mary s removed all lady russell s difficulties 
and it was consequently soon settled that anne should not go to bath 
till lady russell took her and that all the intervening time 
should be divided between uppercross cottage and kellynch lodge 
so far all was perfectly right but lady russell was almost startled 
by the wrong of one part of the kellynch hall plan when it burst on her 
which was mrs clay s being engaged to go to bath with sir walter 
and elizabeth as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter 
in all the business before her lady russell was extremely sorry 
that such a measure should have been resorted to at all wondered 
grieved and feared and the affront it contained to anne 
in mrs clay s being of so much use while anne could be of none 
was a very sore aggravation 
anne herself was become hardened to such affronts but she felt 
the imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as lady russell 
with a great deal of quiet observation and a knowledge 
which she often wished less of her father s character she was 
sensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy 
were more than possible she did not imagine that her father 
had at present an idea of the kind mrs clay had freckles 
and a projecting tooth and a clumsy wrist which he was continually 
making severe remarks upon in her absence but she was young 
and certainly altogether well looking and possessed in an acute mind 
and assiduous pleasing manners infinitely more dangerous attractions 
than any merely personal might have been anne was so impressed 
by the degree of their danger that she could not excuse herself 
from trying to make it perceptible to her sister she had little hope 
of success but elizabeth who in the event of such a reverse would be 
so much more to be pitied than herself should never she thought 
have reason to reproach her for giving no warning 
she spoke and seemed only to offend elizabeth could not conceive 
how such an absurd suspicion should occur to her and indignantly 
answered for each party s perfectly knowing their situation 
mrs clay said she warmly never forgets who she is 
and as i am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be 
i can assure you that upon the subject of marriage they are 
particularly nice and that she reprobates all inequality of condition 
and rank more strongly than most people and as to my father 
i really should not have thought that he who has kept himself single 
so long for our sakes need be suspected now if mrs clay were 
a very beautiful woman i grant you it might be wrong to have her 
so much with me not that anything in the world i am sure 
would induce my father to make a degrading match but he might 
be rendered unhappy but poor mrs clay who with all her merits 
can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty i really think poor 
mrs clay may be staying here in perfect safety one would imagine 
you had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes 
though i know you must fifty times that tooth of her s 
and those freckles freckles do not disgust me so very much 
as they do him i have known a face not materially disfigured by a few 
but he abominates them you must have heard him notice 
mrs clay s freckles 
there is hardly any personal defect replied anne 
which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to 
i think very differently answered elizabeth shortly 
an agreeable manner may set off handsome features but can never 
alter plain ones however at any rate as i have a great deal more 
at stake on this point than anybody else can have i think it 
rather unnecessary in you to be advising me 
anne had done glad that it was over and not absolutely hopeless 
of doing good elizabeth though resenting the suspicion 
might yet be made observant by it 
the last office of the four carriage horses was to draw sir walter 
miss elliot and mrs clay to bath the party drove off in very good spirits 
sir walter prepared with condescending bows for all the afflicted 
tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show themselves 
and anne walked up at the same time in a sort of desolate tranquillity 
to the lodge where she was to spend the first week 
her friend was not in better spirits than herself lady russell felt this 
break up of the family exceedingly their respectability was 
as dear to her as her own and a daily intercourse had become 
precious by habit it was painful to look upon their deserted grounds 
and still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into 
and to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village 
and be out of the way when admiral and mrs croft first arrived 
she had determined to make her own absence from home begin 
when she must give up anne accordingly their removal was made together 
and anne was set down at uppercross cottage in the first stage 
of lady russell s journey 
uppercross was a moderate sized village which a few years back 
had been completely in the old english style containing only 
two houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers 
the mansion of the squire with its high walls great gates and old trees 
substantial and unmodernized and the compact tight parsonage 
enclosed in its own neat garden with a vine and a pear tree 
trained round its casements but upon the marriage of the young squire 
it had received the improvement of a farm house elevated into a cottage 
for his residence and uppercross cottage with its veranda 
french windows and other prettiness was quite as likely to catch 
the traveller s eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect 
and premises of the great house about a quarter of a mile farther on 
here anne had often been staying she knew the ways of uppercross 
as well as those of kellynch the two families were so continually meeting 
so much in the habit of running in and out of each other s house 
at all hours that it was rather a surprise to her to find mary alone 
but being alone her being unwell and out of spirits was almost 
a matter of course though better endowed than the elder sister 
mary had not anne s understanding nor temper while well and happy 
and properly attended to she had great good humour and excellent spirits 
but any indisposition sunk her completely she had no resources 
for solitude and inheriting a considerable share of the elliot 
self importance was very prone to add to every other distress 
that of fancying herself neglected and ill used in person she was 
inferior to both sisters and had even in her bloom only reached 
the dignity of being a fine girl she was now lying on the faded sofa 
of the pretty little drawing room the once elegant furniture of which 
had been gradually growing shabby under the influence of four summers 
and two children and on anne s appearing greeted her with 
so you are come at last i began to think i should never see you 
i am so ill i can hardly speak i have not seen a creature 
the whole morning 
i am sorry to find you unwell replied anne you sent me 
such a good account of yourself on thursday 
yes i made the best of it i always do but i was very far from well 
at the time and i do not think i ever was so ill in my life 
as i have been all this morning very unfit to be left alone i am sure 
suppose i were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way 
and not able to ring the bell so lady russell would not get out 
i do not think she has been in this house three times this summer 
anne said what was proper and enquired after her husband 
oh charles is out shooting i have not seen him since seven of the clock 
he would go though i told him how ill i was he said he should not 
stay out long but he has never come back and now it is almost one 
i assure you i have not seen a soul this whole long morning 
you have had your little boys with you 
yes as long as i could bear their noise but they are so unmanageable 
that they do me more harm than good little charles does not mind 
a word i say and walter is growing quite as bad 
well you will soon be better now replied anne cheerfully 
you know i always cure you when i come how are your neighbours 
at the great house 
i can give you no account of them i have not seen one of them to day 
except mr musgrove who just stopped and spoke through the window 
but without getting off his horse and though i told him how ill i was 
not one of them have been near me it did not happen to suit 
the miss musgroves i suppose and they never put themselves 
out of their way 
you will see them yet perhaps before the morning is gone 
it is early 
i never want them i assure you they talk and laugh a great deal 
too much for me oh anne i am so very unwell it was quite unkind 
of you not to come on thursday 
my dear mary recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself 
you wrote in the cheerfullest manner and said you were perfectly well 
and in no hurry for me and that being the case you must be aware 
that my wish would be to remain with lady russell to the last 
and besides what i felt on her account i have really been so busy 
have had so much to do that i could not very conveniently have 
left kellynch sooner 
dear me what can you possibly have to do 
a great many things i assure you more than i can recollect 
in a moment but i can tell you some i have been making 
a duplicate of the catalogue of my father s books and pictures 
i have been several times in the garden with mackenzie 
trying to understand and make him understand which of elizabeth s plants 
are for lady russell i have had all my own little concerns 
to arrange books and music to divide and all my trunks to repack 
from not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons 
and one thing i have had to do mary of a more trying nature 
going to almost every house in the parish as a sort of take leave 
i was told that they wished it but all these things took up 
a great deal of time 
oh well and after a moment s pause but you have never asked me 
one word about our dinner at the pooles yesterday 
did you go then i have made no enquiries because i concluded 
you must have been obliged to give up the party 
oh yes i went i was very well yesterday nothing at all 
the matter with me till this morning it would have been strange 
if i had not gone 
i am very glad you were well enough and i hope you had a pleasant party 
nothing remarkable one always knows beforehand what the dinner will be 
and who will be there and it is so very uncomfortable not having 
a carriage of one s own mr and mrs musgrove took me and we were 
so crowded they are both so very large and take up so much room 
and mr musgrove always sits forward so there was i crowded into 
the back seat with henrietta and louise and i think it very likely 
that my illness to day may be owing to it 
a little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness 
on anne s side produced nearly a cure on mary s she could soon 
sit upright on the sofa and began to hope she might be able 
to leave it by dinner time then forgetting to think of it 
she was at the other end of the room beautifying a nosegay 
then she ate her cold meat and then she was well enough 
to propose a little walk 
where shall we go said she when they were ready i suppose 
you will not like to call at the great house before they have 
been to see you 
i have not the smallest objection on that account replied anne 
i should never think of standing on such ceremony with people i know 
so well as mrs and the miss musgroves 
oh but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible 
they ought to feel what is due to you as my sister however 
we may as well go and sit with them a little while and when we 
have that over we can enjoy our walk 
anne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent 
but she had ceased to endeavour to check it from believing that 
though there were on each side continual subjects of offence 
neither family could now do without it to the great house accordingly 
they went to sit the full half hour in the old fashioned square parlour 
with a small carpet and shining floor to which the present 
daughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion 
by a grand piano forte and a harp flower stands and little tables 
placed in every direction oh could the originals of the portraits 
against the wainscot could the gentlemen in brown velvet and 
the ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on have been conscious 
of such an overthrow of all order and neatness the portraits themselves 
seemed to be staring in astonishment 
the musgroves like their houses were in a state of alteration 
perhaps of improvement the father and mother were in the old 
english style and the young people in the new mr and mrs musgrove 
were a very good sort of people friendly and hospitable 
not much educated and not at all elegant their children had 
more modern minds and manners there was a numerous family 
but the only two grown up excepting charles were henrietta and louisa 
young ladies of nineteen and twenty who had brought from school at exeter 
all the usual stock of accomplishments and were now like thousands 
of other young ladies living to be fashionable happy and merry 
their dress had every advantage their faces were rather pretty 
their spirits extremely good their manner unembarrassed and pleasant 
they were of consequence at home and favourites abroad 
anne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures 
of her acquaintance but still saved as we all are by some 
comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility 
of exchange she would not have given up her own more elegant 
and cultivated mind for all their enjoyments and envied them nothing 
but that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together 
that good humoured mutual affection of which she had known 
so little herself with either of her sisters 
they were received with great cordiality nothing seemed amiss 
on the side of the great house family which was generally 
as anne very well knew the least to blame the half hour was 
chatted away pleasantly enough and she was not at all surprised 
at the end of it to have their walking party joined by both 
the miss musgroves at mary s particular invitation 
chapter 
anne had not wanted this visit to uppercross to learn that a removal 
from one set of people to another though at a distance of only three miles 
will often include a total change of conversation opinion and idea 
she had never been staying there before without being struck by it 
or without wishing that other elliots could have her advantage 
in seeing how unknown or unconsidered there were the affairs 
which at kellynch hall were treated as of such general publicity 
and pervading interest yet with all this experience she believed 
she must now submit to feel that another lesson in the art of knowing 
our own nothingness beyond our own circle was become necessary for her 
for certainly coming as she did with a heart full of the subject 
which had been completely occupying both houses in kellynch for many weeks 
she had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found 
in the separate but very similar remark of mr and mrs musgrove 
so miss anne sir walter and your sister are gone and what part of bath 
do you think they will settle in and this without much 
waiting for an answer or in the young ladies addition of 
i hope we shall be in bath in the winter but remember papa 
if we do go we must be in a good situation none of your 
queen squares for us or in the anxious supplement from mary of 
upon my word i shall be pretty well off when you are all gone away 
to be happy at bath 
she could only resolve to avoid such self delusion in future 
and think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing 
of having one such truly sympathising friend as lady russell 
the mr musgroves had their own game to guard and to destroy 
their own horses dogs and newspapers to engage them and the females 
were fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping 
neighbours dress dancing and music she acknowledged it to be 
very fitting that every little social commonwealth should dictate 
its own matters of discourse and hoped ere long to become 
a not unworthy member of the one she was now transplanted into 
with the prospect of spending at least two months at uppercross 
it was highly incumbent on her to clothe her imagination her memory 
and all her ideas in as much of uppercross as possible 
she had no dread of these two months mary was not so repulsive 
and unsisterly as elizabeth nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers 
neither was there anything among the other component parts 
of the cottage inimical to comfort she was always on friendly terms 
with her brother in law and in the children who loved her nearly as well 
and respected her a great deal more than their mother she had 
an object of interest amusement and wholesome exertion 
charles musgrove was civil and agreeable in sense and temper he was 
undoubtedly superior to his wife but not of powers or conversation 
or grace to make the past as they were connected together 
at all a dangerous contemplation though at the same time 
anne could believe with lady russell that a more equal match 
might have greatly improved him and that a woman of real understanding 
might have given more consequence to his character and more usefulness 
rationality and elegance to his habits and pursuits as it was 
he did nothing with much zeal but sport and his time was otherwise 
trifled away without benefit from books or anything else 
he had very good spirits which never seemed much affected by 
his wife s occasional lowness bore with her unreasonableness 
sometimes to anne s admiration and upon the whole though there was 
very often a little disagreement in which she had sometimes more share 
than she wished being appealed to by both parties they might pass 
for a happy couple they were always perfectly agreed in the want 
of more money and a strong inclination for a handsome present 
from his father but here as on most topics he had the superiority 
for while mary thought it a great shame that such a present was not made 
he always contended for his father s having many other uses for his money 
and a right to spend it as he liked 
as to the management of their children his theory was much better 
than his wife s and his practice not so bad i could manage them 
very well if it were not for mary s interference was what 
anne often heard him say and had a good deal of faith in 
but when listening in turn to mary s reproach of charles spoils 
the children so that i cannot get them into any order she never had 
the smallest temptation to say very true 
one of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there 
was her being treated with too much confidence by all parties 
and being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house 
known to have some influence with her sister she was continually requested 
or at least receiving hints to exert it beyond what was practicable 
i wish you could persuade mary not to be always fancying herself ill 
was charles s language and in an unhappy mood thus spoke mary 
i do believe if charles were to see me dying he would not think 
there was anything the matter with me i am sure anne if you would 
you might persuade him that i really am very ill a great deal worse 
than i ever own 
mary s declaration was i hate sending the children to the great house 
though their grandmamma is always wanting to see them for she humours 
and indulges them to such a degree and gives them so much trash 
and sweet things that they are sure to come back sick and cross 
for the rest of the day and mrs musgrove took the first opportunity 
of being alone with anne to say oh miss anne i cannot help wishing 
mrs charles had a little of your method with those children 
they are quite different creatures with you but to be sure 
in general they are so spoilt it is a pity you cannot put your sister 
in the way of managing them they are as fine healthy children 
as ever were seen poor little dears without partiality 
but mrs charles knows no more how they should be treated 
bless me how troublesome they are sometimes i assure you miss anne 
it prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as 
i otherwise should i believe mrs charles is not quite pleased 
with my not inviting them oftener but you know it is very bad 
to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking 
every moment do not do this and do not do that or that one can 
only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them 
she had this communication moreover from mary mrs musgrove thinks 
all her servants so steady that it would be high treason 
to call it in question but i am sure without exaggeration 
that her upper house maid and laundry maid instead of being 
in their business are gadding about the village all day long 
i meet them wherever i go and i declare i never go twice into my nursery 
without seeing something of them if jemima were not the trustiest 
steadiest creature in the world it would be enough to spoil her 
for she tells me they are always tempting her to take a walk with them 
and on mrs musgrove s side it was i make a rule of never interfering 
in any of my daughter in law s concerns for i know it would not do 
but i shall tell you miss anne because you may be able to set things 
to rights that i have no very good opinion of mrs charles s nursery maid 
i hear strange stories of her she is always upon the gad and from 
my own knowledge i can declare she is such a fine dressing lady 
that she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near 
mrs charles quite swears by her i know but i just give you this hint 
that you may be upon the watch because if you see anything amiss 
you need not be afraid of mentioning it 
again it was mary s complaint that mrs musgrove was very apt 
not to give her the precedence that was her due when they dined 
at the great house with other families and she did not see any reason 
why she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place 
and one day when anne was walking with only the musgroves one of them 
after talking of rank people of rank and jealousy of rank said 
i have no scruple of observing to you how nonsensical some persons are 
about their place because all the world knows how easy and indifferent 
you are about it but i wish anybody could give mary a hint that 
it would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious 
especially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take 
place of mamma nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma 
but it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it 
it is not that mamma cares about it the least in the world 
but i know it is taken notice of by many persons 
how was anne to set all these matters to rights she could do little more 
than listen patiently soften every grievance and excuse each 
to the other give them all hints of the forbearance necessary 
between such near neighbours and make those hints broadest 
which were meant for her sister s benefit 
in all other respects her visit began and proceeded very well 
her own spirits improved by change of place and subject 
by being removed three miles from kellynch mary s ailments lessened 
by having a constant companion and their daily intercourse 
with the other family since there was neither superior affection 
confidence nor employment in the cottage to be interrupted by it 
was rather an advantage it was certainly carried nearly as far as possible 
for they met every morning and hardly ever spent an evening asunder 
but she believed they should not have done so well without the sight 
of mr and mrs musgrove s respectable forms in the usual places 
or without the talking laughing and singing of their daughters 
she played a great deal better than either of the miss musgroves 
but having no voice no knowledge of the harp and no fond parents 
to sit by and fancy themselves delighted her performance was 
little thought of only out of civility or to refresh the others 
as she was well aware she knew that when she played she was 
giving pleasure only to herself but this was no new sensation 
excepting one short period of her life she had never since the age 
of fourteen never since the loss of her dear mother known the happiness 
of being listened to or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste 
in music she had been always used to feel alone in the world 
and mr and mrs musgrove s fond partiality for their own daughters 
performance and total indifference to any other person s 
gave her much more pleasure for their sakes than mortification 
for her own 
the party at the great house was sometimes increased by other company 
the neighbourhood was not large but the musgroves were visited 
by everybody and had more dinner parties and more callers 
more visitors by invitation and by chance than any other family 
there were more completely popular 
the girls were wild for dancing and the evenings ended occasionally 
in an unpremeditated little ball there was a family of cousins 
within a walk of uppercross in less affluent circumstances 
who depended on the musgroves for all their pleasures they would come 
at any time and help play at anything or dance anywhere and anne 
very much preferring the office of musician to a more active post 
played country dances to them by the hour together a kindness which 
always recommended her musical powers to the notice of mr and mrs musgrove 
more than anything else and often drew this compliment 
well done miss anne very well done indeed lord bless me 
how those little fingers of yours fly about 
so passed the first three weeks michaelmas came and now anne s heart 
must be in kellynch again a beloved home made over to others 
all the precious rooms and furniture groves and prospects 
beginning to own other eyes and other limbs she could not 
think of much else on the th of september and she had this 
sympathetic touch in the evening from mary who on having occasion 
to note down the day of the month exclaimed dear me is not this 
the day the crofts were to come to kellynch i am glad i did not 
think of it before how low it makes me 
the crofts took possession with true naval alertness and were 
to be visited mary deplored the necessity for herself 
nobody knew how much she should suffer she should put it off 
as long as she could but was not easy till she had talked charles 
into driving her over on an early day and was in a very animated 
comfortable state of imaginary agitation when she came back 
anne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going 
she wished however to see the crofts and was glad to be within 
when the visit was returned they came the master of the house 
was not at home but the two sisters were together and as it chanced 
that mrs croft fell to the share of anne while the admiral sat by mary 
and made himself very agreeable by his good humoured notice 
of her little boys she was well able to watch for a likeness 
and if it failed her in the features to catch it in the voice 
or in the turn of sentiment and expression 
mrs croft though neither tall nor fat had a squareness 
uprightness and vigour of form which gave importance to her person 
she had bright dark eyes good teeth and altogether an agreeable face 
though her reddened and weather beaten complexion the consequence 
of her having been almost as much at sea as her husband made her seem to 
have lived some years longer in the world than her real eight and thirty 
her manners were open easy and decided like one who had 
no distrust of herself and no doubts of what to do without any 
approach to coarseness however or any want of good humour 
anne gave her credit indeed for feelings of great consideration 
towards herself in all that related to kellynch and it pleased her 
especially as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute 
in the instant even of introduction that there was not the smallest 
symptom of any knowledge or suspicion on mrs croft s side to give a bias 
of any sort she was quite easy on that head and consequently 
full of strength and courage till for a moment electrified by 
mrs croft s suddenly saying 
it was you and not your sister i find that my brother had 
the pleasure of being acquainted with when he was in this country 
anne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing but the age of emotion 
she certainly had not 
perhaps you may not have heard that he is married added mrs croft 
she could now answer as she ought and was happy to feel 
when mrs croft s next words explained it to be mr wentworth 
of whom she spoke that she had said nothing which might not do 
for either brother she immediately felt how reasonable it was 
that mrs croft should be thinking and speaking of edward 
and not of frederick and with shame at her own forgetfulness 
applied herself to the knowledge of their former neighbour s 
present state with proper interest 
the rest was all tranquillity till just as they were moving 
she heard the admiral say to mary 
we are expecting a brother of mrs croft s here soon i dare say 
you know him by name 
he was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys 
clinging to him like an old friend and declaring he should not go 
and being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away 
in his coat pockets c to have another moment for finishing 
or recollecting what he had begun anne was left to persuade herself 
as well as she could that the same brother must still be in question 
she could not however reach such a degree of certainty 
as not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject 
at the other house where the crofts had previously been calling 
the folks of the great house were to spend the evening of this day 
at the cottage and it being now too late in the year for such visits 
to be made on foot the coach was beginning to be listened for 
when the youngest miss musgrove walked in that she was coming 
to apologize and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves 
was the first black idea and mary was quite ready to be affronted 
when louisa made all right by saying that she only came on foot 
to leave more room for the harp which was bringing in the carriage 
and i will tell you our reason she added and all about it 
i am come on to give you notice that papa and mamma are 
out of spirits this evening especially mamma she is thinking so much 
of poor richard and we agreed it would be best to have the harp 
for it seems to amuse her more than the piano forte i will tell you 
why she is out of spirits when the crofts called this morning 
they called here afterwards did not they they happened to say 
that her brother captain wentworth is just returned to england 
or paid off or something and is coming to see them almost directly 
and most unluckily it came into mamma s head when they were gone 
that wentworth or something very like it was the name of 
poor richard s captain at one time i do not know when or where 
but a great while before he died poor fellow and upon looking over 
his letters and things she found it was so and is perfectly sure 
that this must be the very man and her head is quite full of it 
and of poor richard so we must be as merry as we can that she may not 
be dwelling upon such gloomy things 
the real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were 
that the musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome 
hopeless son and the good fortune to lose him before he reached 
his twentieth year that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid 
and unmanageable on shore that he had been very little cared for 
at any time by his family though quite as much as he deserved 
seldom heard of and scarcely at all regretted when the intelligence 
of his death abroad had worked its way to uppercross two years before 
he had in fact though his sisters were now doing all they could for him 
by calling him poor richard been nothing better than a thick headed 
unfeeling unprofitable dick musgrove who had never done anything 
to entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name 
living or dead 
he had been several years at sea and had in the course of those removals 
to which all midshipmen are liable and especially such midshipmen 
as every captain wishes to get rid of been six months on board 
captain frederick wentworth s frigate the laconia and from the laconia 
he had under the influence of his captain written the only two letters 
which his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole 
of his absence that is to say the only two disinterested letters 
all the rest had been mere applications for money 
in each letter he had spoken well of his captain but yet 
so little were they in the habit of attending to such matters 
so unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships 
that it had made scarcely any impression at the time and that mrs musgrove 
should have been suddenly struck this very day with a recollection 
of the name of wentworth as connected with her son seemed one of those 
extraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur 
she had gone to her letters and found it all as she supposed 
and the re perusal of these letters after so long an interval 
her poor son gone for ever and all the strength of his faults forgotten 
had affected her spirits exceedingly and thrown her into 
greater grief for him than she had know on first hearing of his death 
mr musgrove was in a lesser degree affected likewise and when 
they reached the cottage they were evidently in want first 
of being listened to anew on this subject and afterwards 
of all the relief which cheerful companions could give them 
to hear them talking so much of captain wentworth repeating his name 
so often puzzling over past years and at last ascertaining that it might 
that it probably would turn out to be the very same captain wentworth 
whom they recollected meeting once or twice after their coming back 
from clifton a very fine young man but they could not say whether 
it was seven or eight years ago was a new sort of trial to anne s nerves 
she found however that it was one to which she must inure herself 
since he actually was expected in the country she must teach herself 
to be insensible on such points and not only did it appear that 
he was expected and speedily but the musgroves in their warm gratitude 
for the kindness he had shewn poor dick and very high respect 
for his character stamped as it was by poor dick s having been 
six months under his care and mentioning him in strong 
though not perfectly well spelt praise as a fine dashing felow 
only two perticular about the schoolmaster were bent on 
introducing themselves and seeking his acquaintance as soon as 
they could hear of his arrival 
the resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening 
chapter 
a very few days more and captain wentworth was known to be at kellynch 
and mr musgrove had called on him and come back warm in his praise 
and he was engaged with the crofts to dine at uppercross 
by the end of another week it had been a great disappointment 
to mr musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed 
so impatient was he to shew his gratitude by seeing captain wentworth 
under his own roof and welcoming him to all that was strongest 
and best in his cellars but a week must pass only a week 
in anne s reckoning and then she supposed they must meet 
and soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week 
captain wentworth made a very early return to mr musgrove s civility 
and she was all but calling there in the same half hour 
she and mary were actually setting forward for the great house 
where as she afterwards learnt they must inevitably have found him 
when they were stopped by the eldest boy s being at that moment 
brought home in consequence of a bad fall the child s situation 
put the visit entirely aside but she could not hear of her escape 
with indifference even in the midst of the serious anxiety 
which they afterwards felt on his account 
his collar bone was found to be dislocated and such injury 
received in the back as roused the most alarming ideas 
it was an afternoon of distress and anne had every thing to do at once 
the apothecary to send for the father to have pursued and informed 
the mother to support and keep from hysterics the servants to control 
the youngest child to banish and the poor suffering one to attend 
and soothe besides sending as soon as she recollected it 
proper notice to the other house which brought her an accession 
rather of frightened enquiring companions than of very useful assistants 
her brother s return was the first comfort he could take best care 
of his wife and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary 
till he came and had examined the child their apprehensions were 
the worse for being vague they suspected great injury but knew not where 
but now the collar bone was soon replaced and though mr robinson 
felt and felt and rubbed and looked grave and spoke low words 
both to the father and the aunt still they were all to hope the best 
and to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind 
and then it was just before they parted that the two young aunts 
were able so far to digress from their nephew s state as to give 
the information of captain wentworth s visit staying five minutes behind 
their father and mother to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted 
they were with him how much handsomer how infinitely more agreeable 
they thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance 
who had been at all a favourite before how glad they had been 
to hear papa invite him to stay dinner how sorry when he said 
it was quite out of his power and how glad again when he had promised 
in reply to papa and mamma s farther pressing invitations to come 
and dine with them on the morrow actually on the morrow 
and he had promised it in so pleasant a manner as if he felt 
all the motive of their attention just as he ought and in short 
he had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace 
that they could assure them all their heads were both turned by him 
and off they ran quite as full of glee as of love and apparently 
more full of captain wentworth than of little charles 
the same story and the same raptures were repeated when the two girls came 
with their father through the gloom of the evening to make enquiries 
and mr musgrove no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir 
could add his confirmation and praise and hope there would be now 
no occasion for putting captain wentworth off and only be sorry to think 
that the cottage party probably would not like to leave the little boy 
to give him the meeting oh no as to leaving the little boy 
both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm 
to bear the thought and anne in the joy of the escape 
could not help adding her warm protestations to theirs 
charles musgrove indeed afterwards shewed more of inclination 
the child was going on so well and he wished so much to be introduced 
to captain wentworth that perhaps he might join them in the evening 
he would not dine from home but he might walk in for half an hour 
but in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife with oh no indeed 
charles i cannot bear to have you go away only think if anything 
should happen 
the child had a good night and was going on well the next day 
it must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been 
done to the spine but mr robinson found nothing to increase alarm 
and charles musgrove began consequently to feel no necessity 
for longer confinement the child was to be kept in bed and amused 
as quietly as possible but what was there for a father to do 
this was quite a female case and it would be highly absurd in him 
who could be of no use at home to shut himself up his father 
very much wished him to meet captain wentworth and there being 
no sufficient reason against it he ought to go and it ended in his 
making a bold public declaration when he came in from shooting 
of his meaning to dress directly and dine at the other house 
nothing can be going on better than the child said he 
so i told my father just now that i would come and he thought me 
quite right your sister being with you my love i have no scruple at all 
you would not like to leave him yourself but you see i can be of no use 
anne will send for me if anything is the matter 
husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain 
mary knew from charles s manner of speaking that he was 
quite determined on going and that it would be of no use to teaze him 
she said nothing therefore till he was out of the room 
but as soon as there was only anne to hear 
so you and i are to be left to shift by ourselves with this 
poor sick child and not a creature coming near us all the evening 
i knew how it would be this is always my luck if there is 
anything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it 
and charles is as bad as any of them very unfeeling i must say 
it is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy 
talks of his being going on so well how does he know that he is 
going on well or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence 
i did not think charles would have been so unfeeling so here he is to 
go away and enjoy himself and because i am the poor mother 
i am not to be allowed to stir and yet i am sure i am more unfit 
than anybody else to be about the child my being the mother 
is the very reason why my feelings should not be tried i am not at all 
equal to it you saw how hysterical i was yesterday 
but that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm 
of the shock you will not be hysterical again i dare say we shall have 
nothing to distress us i perfectly understand mr robinson s directions 
and have no fears and indeed mary i cannot wonder at your husband 
nursing does not belong to a man it is not his province 
a sick child is always the mother s property her own feelings 
generally make it so 
i hope i am as fond of my child as any mother but i do not know 
that i am of any more use in the sick room than charles 
for i cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill 
and you saw this morning that if i told him to keep quiet 
he was sure to begin kicking about i have not nerves 
for the sort of thing 
but could you be comfortable yourself to be spending 
the whole evening away from the poor boy 
yes you see his papa can and why should not i jemima is so careful 
and she could send us word every hour how he was i really think 
charles might as well have told his father we would all come 
i am not more alarmed about little charles now than he is 
i was dreadfully alarmed yesterday but the case is very different to day 
well if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself 
suppose you were to go as well as your husband leave little charles 
to my care mr and mrs musgrove cannot think it wrong while i remain 
with him 
are you serious cried mary her eyes brightening dear me 
that is a very good thought very good indeed to be sure 
i may just as well go as not for i am of no use at home am i 
and it only harasses me you who have not a mother s feelings 
are a great deal the properest person you can make little charles 
do anything he always minds you at a word it will be a great deal better 
than leaving him only with jemima oh i shall certainly go 
i am sure i ought if i can quite as much as charles for they want me 
excessively to be acquainted with captain wentworth and i know 
you do not mind being left alone an excellent thought of yours 
indeed anne i will go and tell charles and get ready directly 
you can send for us you know at a moment s notice if anything 
is the matter but i dare say there will be nothing to alarm you 
i should not go you may be sure if i did not feel quite at ease 
about my dear child 
the next moment she was tapping at her husband s dressing room door 
and as anne followed her up stairs she was in time for 
the whole conversation which began with mary s saying 
in a tone of great exultation 
i mean to go with you charles for i am of no more use at home 
than you are if i were to shut myself up for ever with the child 
i should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like 
anne will stay anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him 
it is anne s own proposal and so i shall go with you which will be 
a great deal better for i have not dined at the other house since tuesday 
this is very kind of anne was her husband s answer and i should be 
very glad to have you go but it seems rather hard that she should be 
left at home by herself to nurse our sick child 
anne was now at hand to take up her own because and the sincerity 
of her manner being soon sufficient to convince him where conviction 
was at least very agreeable he had no farther scruples as to her being 
left to dine alone though he still wanted her to join them in the evening 
when the child might be at rest for the night and kindly urged her 
to let him come and fetch her but she was quite unpersuadable 
and this being the case she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them 
set off together in high spirits they were gone she hoped 
to be happy however oddly constructed such happiness might seem 
as for herself she was left with as many sensations of comfort 
as were perhaps ever likely to be hers she knew herself to be 
of the first utility to the child and what was it to her 
if frederick wentworth were only half a mile distant making himself 
agreeable to others 
she would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting 
perhaps indifferent if indifference could exist under such circumstances 
he must be either indifferent or unwilling had he wished 
ever to see her again he need not have waited till this time 
he would have done what she could not but believe that in his place 
she should have done long ago when events had been early giving him 
the independence which alone had been wanting 
her brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance 
and their visit in general there had been music singing 
talking laughing all that was most agreeable charming manners 
in captain wentworth no shyness or reserve they seemed all 
to know each other perfectly and he was coming the very next morning 
to shoot with charles he was to come to breakfast but not at the cottage 
though that had been proposed at first but then he had been pressed 
to come to the great house instead and he seemed afraid of being 
in mrs charles musgrove s way on account of the child and therefore 
somehow they hardly knew how it ended in charles s being to meet him 
to breakfast at his father s 
anne understood it he wished to avoid seeing her he had inquired 
after her she found slightly as might suit a former slight acquaintance 
seeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged actuated perhaps 
by the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet 
the morning hours of the cottage were always later than those 
of the other house and on the morrow the difference was so great 
that mary and anne were not more than beginning breakfast when 
charles came in to say that they were just setting off that he was 
come for his dogs that his sisters were following with captain wentworth 
his sisters meaning to visit mary and the child and captain wentworth 
proposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient 
and though charles had answered for the child s being in no such state 
as could make it inconvenient captain wentworth would not be satisfied 
without his running on to give notice 
mary very much gratified by this attention was delighted to receive him 
while a thousand feelings rushed on anne of which this was 
the most consoling that it would soon be over and it was soon over 
in two minutes after charles s preparation the others appeared 
they were in the drawing room her eye half met captain wentworth s 
a bow a curtsey passed she heard his voice he talked to mary 
said all that was right said something to the miss musgroves 
enough to mark an easy footing the room seemed full full of persons 
and voices but a few minutes ended it charles shewed himself 
at the window all was ready their visitor had bowed and was gone 
the miss musgroves were gone too suddenly resolving to walk 
to the end of the village with the sportsmen the room was cleared 
and anne might finish her breakfast as she could 
it is over it is over she repeated to herself again and again 
in nervous gratitude the worst is over 
mary talked but she could not attend she had seen him 
they had met they had been once more in the same room 
soon however she began to reason with herself and try to be feeling less 
eight years almost eight years had passed since all had been given up 
how absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval 
had banished into distance and indistinctness what might not 
eight years do events of every description changes alienations 
removals all all must be comprised in it and oblivion of the past 
how natural how certain too it included nearly a third part 
of her own life 
alas with all her reasoning she found that to retentive feelings 
eight years may be little more than nothing 
now how were his sentiments to be read was this like 
wishing to avoid her and the next moment she was hating herself 
for the folly which asked the question 
on one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom 
might not have prevented she was soon spared all suspense 
for after the miss musgroves had returned and finished their visit 
at the cottage she had this spontaneous information from mary 
captain wentworth is not very gallant by you anne though he was 
so attentive to me henrietta asked him what he thought of you 
when they went away and he said you were so altered he should not 
have known you again 
mary had no feelings to make her respect her sister s in a common way 
but she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound 
altered beyond his knowledge anne fully submitted in silent 
deep mortification doubtless it was so and she could take no revenge 
for he was not altered or not for the worse she had already 
acknowledged it to herself and she could not think differently 
let him think of her as he would no the years which had destroyed 
her youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing manly 
open look in no respect lessening his personal advantages 
she had seen the same frederick wentworth 
so altered that he should not have known her again these were words 
which could not but dwell with her yet she soon began to rejoice 
that she had heard them they were of sobering tendency 
they allayed agitation they composed and consequently must 
make her happier 
frederick wentworth had used such words or something like them 
but without an idea that they would be carried round to her 
he had thought her wretchedly altered and in the first moment of appeal 
had spoken as he felt he had not forgiven anne elliot 
she had used him ill deserted and disappointed him and worse 
she had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so which his own decided 
confident temper could not endure she had given him up to oblige others 
it had been the effect of over persuasion it had been 
weakness and timidity 
he had been most warmly attached to her and had never seen a woman since 
whom he thought her equal but except from some natural sensation 
of curiosity he had no desire of meeting her again her power with him 
was gone for ever 
it was now his object to marry he was rich and being turned on shore 
fully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly tempted 
actually looking round ready to fall in love with all the speed 
which a clear head and a quick taste could allow he had a heart 
for either of the miss musgroves if they could catch it a heart 
in short for any pleasing young woman who came in his way 
excepting anne elliot this was his only secret exception 
when he said to his sister in answer to her suppositions 
yes here i am sophia quite ready to make a foolish match 
anybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking 
a little beauty and a few smiles and a few compliments to the navy 
and i am a lost man should not this be enough for a sailor 
who has had no society among women to make him nice 
he said it she knew to be contradicted his bright proud eye 
spoke the conviction that he was nice and anne elliot was 
not out of his thoughts when he more seriously described 
the woman he should wish to meet with a strong mind 
with sweetness of manner made the first and the last of the description 
that is the woman i want said he something a little inferior 
i shall of course put up with but it must not be much if i am a fool 
i shall be a fool indeed for i have thought on the subject 
more than most men 
chapter 
from this time captain wentworth and anne elliot were repeatedly 
in the same circle they were soon dining in company together 
at mr musgrove s for the little boy s state could no longer 
supply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself and this was 
but the beginning of other dinings and other meetings 
whether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof 
former times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each 
they could not but be reverted to the year of their engagement 
could not but be named by him in the little narratives or descriptions 
which conversation called forth his profession qualified him 
his disposition lead him to talk and that was in the year six 
that happened before i went to sea in the year six occurred 
in the course of the first evening they spent together 
and though his voice did not falter and though she had no reason 
to suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke 
anne felt the utter impossibility from her knowledge of his mind 
that he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself 
there must be the same immediate association of thought 
though she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain 
they had no conversation together no intercourse but what 
the commonest civility required once so much to each other 
now nothing there had been a time when of all the large party 
now filling the drawing room at uppercross they would have found it 
most difficult to cease to speak to one another with the exception 
perhaps of admiral and mrs croft who seemed particularly attached 
and happy anne could allow no other exceptions even among 
the married couples there could have been no two hearts so open 
no tastes so similar no feelings so in unison no countenances so beloved 
now they were as strangers nay worse than strangers for they could 
never become acquainted it was a perpetual estrangement 
when he talked she heard the same voice and discerned the same mind 
there was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party 
and he was very much questioned and especially by the two miss musgroves 
who seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him as to the manner 
of living on board daily regulations food hours c and their surprise 
at his accounts at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement 
which was practicable drew from him some pleasant ridicule 
which reminded anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant 
and she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board 
without anything to eat or any cook to dress it if there were 
or any servant to wait or any knife and fork to use 
from thus listening and thinking she was roused by a whisper 
of mrs musgrove s who overcome by fond regrets could not help saying 
ah miss anne if it had pleased heaven to spare my poor son 
i dare say he would have been just such another by this time 
anne suppressed a smile and listened kindly while mrs musgrove 
relieved her heart a little more and for a few minutes therefore 
could not keep pace with the conversation of the others 
when she could let her attention take its natural course again 
she found the miss musgroves just fetching the navy list 
their own navy list the first that had ever been at uppercross 
and sitting down together to pore over it with the professed view 
of finding out the ships that captain wentworth had commanded 
your first was the asp i remember we will look for the asp 
you will not find her there quite worn out and broken up 
i was the last man who commanded her hardly fit for service then 
reported fit for home service for a year or two and so i was sent off 
to the west indies 
the girls looked all amazement 
the admiralty he continued entertain themselves now and then 
with sending a few hundred men to sea in a ship not fit to be employed 
but they have a great many to provide for and among the thousands 
that may just as well go to the bottom as not it is impossible 
for them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed 
phoo phoo cried the admiral what stuff these young fellows talk 
never was a better sloop than the asp in her day for an old built sloop 
you would not see her equal lucky fellow to get her he knows there 
must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her 
at the same time lucky fellow to get anything so soon 
with no more interest than his 
i felt my luck admiral i assure you replied captain wentworth 
seriously i was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire 
it was a great object with me at that time to be at sea 
a very great object i wanted to be doing something 
to be sure you did what should a young fellow like you do ashore 
for half a year together if a man had not a wife he soon wants 
to be afloat again 
but captain wentworth cried louisa how vexed you must have been 
when you came to the asp to see what an old thing they had given you 
i knew pretty well what she was before that day said he smiling 
i had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to 
the fashion and strength of any old pelisse which you had seen 
lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember 
and which at last on some very wet day is lent to yourself 
ah she was a dear old asp to me she did all that i wanted 
i knew she would i knew that we should either go to the bottom together 
or that she would be the making of me and i never had two days 
of foul weather all the time i was at sea in her and after 
taking privateers enough to be very entertaining i had the good luck 
in my passage home the next autumn to fall in with the very french frigate 
i wanted i brought her into plymouth and here another instance of luck 
we had not been six hours in the sound when a gale came on 
which lasted four days and nights and which would have done for 
poor old asp in half the time our touch with the great nation 
not having much improved our condition four and twenty hours later 
and i should only have been a gallant captain wentworth 
in a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers and being lost 
in only a sloop nobody would have thought about me anne s shudderings 
were to herself alone but the miss musgroves could be as open 
as they were sincere in their exclamations of pity and horror 
and so then i suppose said mrs musgrove in a low voice 
as if thinking aloud so then he went away to the laconia and there 
he met with our poor boy charles my dear beckoning him to her 
do ask captain wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother 
i always forgot 
it was at gibraltar mother i know dick had been left ill at gibraltar 
with a recommendation from his former captain to captain wentworth 
oh but charles tell captain wentworth he need not be afraid 
of mentioning poor dick before me for it would be rather a pleasure 
to hear him talked of by such a good friend 
charles being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case 
only nodded in reply and walked away 
the girls were now hunting for the laconia and captain wentworth 
could not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume 
into his own hands to save them the trouble and once more read aloud 
the little statement of her name and rate and present 
non commissioned class observing over it that she too had been 
one of the best friends man ever had 
ah those were pleasant days when i had the laconia how fast i 
made money in her a friend of mine and i had such a lovely cruise 
together off the western islands poor harville sister 
you know how much he wanted money worse than myself he had a wife 
excellent fellow i shall never forget his happiness he felt it all 
so much for her sake i wished for him again the next summer 
when i had still the same luck in the mediterranean 
and i am sure sir said mrs musgrove it was a lucky day for us 
when you were put captain into that ship we shall never forget 
what you did 
her feelings made her speak low and captain wentworth 
hearing only in part and probably not having dick musgrove at all 
near his thoughts looked rather in suspense and as if waiting for more 
my brother whispered one of the girls mamma is thinking 
of poor richard 
poor dear fellow continued mrs musgrove he was grown so steady 
and such an excellent correspondent while he was under your care 
ah it would have been a happy thing if he had never left you 
i assure you captain wentworth we are very sorry he ever left you 
there was a momentary expression in captain wentworth s face at this speech 
a certain glance of his bright eye and curl of his handsome mouth 
which convinced anne that instead of sharing in mrs musgrove s kind wishes 
as to her son he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him 
but it was too transient an indulgence of self amusement to be detected 
by any who understood him less than herself in another moment 
he was perfectly collected and serious and almost instantly afterwards 
coming up to the sofa on which she and mrs musgrove were sitting 
took a place by the latter and entered into conversation with her 
in a low voice about her son doing it with so much sympathy 
and natural grace as shewed the kindest consideration for all 
that was real and unabsurd in the parent s feelings 
they were actually on the same sofa for mrs musgrove had 
most readily made room for him they were divided only by mrs musgrove 
it was no insignificant barrier indeed mrs musgrove was of 
a comfortable substantial size infinitely more fitted by nature 
to express good cheer and good humour than tenderness and sentiment 
and while the agitations of anne s slender form and pensive face 
may be considered as very completely screened captain wentworth 
should be allowed some credit for the self command with which 
he attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son 
whom alive nobody had cared for 
personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions 
a large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction 
as the most graceful set of limbs in the world but fair or not fair 
there are unbecoming conjunctions which reason will patronize in vain 
which taste cannot tolerate which ridicule will seize 
the admiral after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room 
with his hands behind him being called to order by his wife 
now came up to captain wentworth and without any observation 
of what he might be interrupting thinking only of his own thoughts 
began with 
if you had been a week later at lisbon last spring frederick 
you would have been asked to give a passage to lady mary grierson 
and her daughters 
should i i am glad i was not a week later then 
the admiral abused him for his want of gallantry he defended himself 
though professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies 
on board a ship of his excepting for a ball or a visit 
which a few hours might comprehend 
but if i know myself said he this is from no want of gallantry 
towards them it is rather from feeling how impossible it is 
with all one s efforts and all one s sacrifices to make 
the accommodations on board such as women ought to have 
there can be no want of gallantry admiral in rating the claims of women 
to every personal comfort high and this is what i do i hate to hear 
of women on board or to see them on board and no ship under my command 
shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere if i can help it 
this brought his sister upon him 
oh frederick but i cannot believe it of you all idle refinement 
women may be as comfortable on board as in the best house in england 
i believe i have lived as much on board as most women and i know 
nothing superior to the accommodations of a man of war i declare 
i have not a comfort or an indulgence about me even at kellynch hall 
with a kind bow to anne beyond what i always had in most of 
the ships i have lived in and they have been five altogether 
nothing to the purpose replied her brother you were living 
with your husband and were the only woman on board 
but you yourself brought mrs harville her sister her cousin 
and three children round from portsmouth to plymouth where was this 
superfine extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then 
all merged in my friendship sophia i would assist any 
brother officer s wife that i could and i would bring anything 
of harville s from the world s end if he wanted it but do not imagine 
that i did not feel it an evil in itself 
depend upon it they were all perfectly comfortable 
i might not like them the better for that perhaps such a number 
of women and children have no right to be comfortable on board 
my dear frederick you are talking quite idly pray what would 
become of us poor sailors wives who often want to be conveyed to 
one port or another after our husbands if everybody had your feelings 
my feelings you see did not prevent my taking mrs harville 
and all her family to plymouth 
but i hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman 
and as if women were all fine ladies instead of rational creatures 
we none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days 
ah my dear said the admiral when he had got a wife 
he will sing a different tune when he is married if we have 
the good luck to live to another war we shall see him do as you and i 
and a great many others have done we shall have him very thankful 
to anybody that will bring him his wife 
ay that we shall 
now i have done cried captain wentworth when once married 
people begin to attack me with oh you will think very differently 
when you are married i can only say no i shall not and then 
they say again yes you will and there is an end of it 
he got up and moved away 
what a great traveller you must have been madam said mrs musgrove 
to mrs croft 
pretty well madam in the fifteen years of my marriage 
though many women have done more i have crossed the atlantic 
four times and have been once to the east indies and back again 
and only once besides being in different places about home 
cork and lisbon and gibraltar but i never went beyond the streights 
and never was in the west indies we do not call bermuda or bahama 
you know the west indies 
mrs musgrove had not a word to say in dissent she could not accuse herself 
of having ever called them anything in the whole course of her life 
and i do assure you madam pursued mrs croft that nothing can exceed 
the accommodations of a man of war i speak you know of the higher rates 
when you come to a frigate of course you are more confined 
though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them 
and i can safely say that the happiest part of my life has been spent 
on board a ship while we were together you know there was nothing 
to be feared thank god i have always been blessed with 
excellent health and no climate disagrees with me a little disordered 
always the first twenty four hours of going to sea but never knew 
what sickness was afterwards the only time i ever really suffered 
in body or mind the only time that i ever fancied myself unwell 
or had any ideas of danger was the winter that i passed by myself at deal 
when the admiral captain croft then was in the north seas 
i lived in perpetual fright at that time and had all manner of 
imaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself 
or when i should hear from him next but as long as we could be together 
nothing ever ailed me and i never met with the smallest inconvenience 
aye to be sure yes indeed oh yes i am quite of your opinion 
mrs croft was mrs musgrove s hearty answer there is nothing so bad 
as a separation i am quite of your opinion i know what it is 
for mr musgrove always attends the assizes and i am so glad when 
they are over and he is safe back again 
the evening ended with dancing on its being proposed 
anne offered her services as usual and though her eyes would sometimes 
fill with tears as she sat at the instrument she was extremely glad 
to be employed and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved 
it was a merry joyous party and no one seemed in higher spirits 
than captain wentworth she felt that he had every thing to elevate 
him which general attention and deference and especially the attention 
of all the young women could do the miss hayters the females 
of the family of cousins already mentioned were apparently admitted 
to the honour of being in love with him and as for henrietta and louisa 
they both seemed so entirely occupied by him that nothing but 
the continued appearance of the most perfect good will between themselves 
could have made it credible that they were not decided rivals 
if he were a little spoilt by such universal such eager admiration 
who could wonder 
these were some of the thoughts which occupied anne while her fingers 
were mechanically at work proceeding for half an hour together 
equally without error and without consciousness once she felt 
that he was looking at herself observing her altered features 
perhaps trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once 
charmed him and once she knew that he must have spoken of her 
she was hardly aware of it till she heard the answer but then she was 
sure of his having asked his partner whether miss elliot never danced 
the answer was oh no never she has quite given up dancing 
she had rather play she is never tired of playing once too 
he spoke to her she had left the instrument on the dancing being over 
and he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished 
to give the miss musgroves an idea of unintentionally she returned 
to that part of the room he saw her and instantly rising 
said with studied politeness 
i beg your pardon madam this is your seat and though she immediately 
drew back with a decided negative he was not to be induced 
to sit down again 
anne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches 
his cold politeness his ceremonious grace were worse than anything 
chapter 
captain wentworth was come to kellynch as to a home to stay 
as long as he liked being as thoroughly the object of 
the admiral s fraternal kindness as of his wife s he had intended 
on first arriving to proceed very soon into shropshire 
and visit the brother settled in that country but the attractions 
of uppercross induced him to put this off there was so much 
of friendliness and of flattery and of everything most bewitching 
in his reception there the old were so hospitable the young so agreeable 
that he could not but resolve to remain where he was and take all 
the charms and perfections of edward s wife upon credit a little longer 
it was soon uppercross with him almost every day the musgroves 
could hardly be more ready to invite than he to come particularly 
in the morning when he had no companion at home for the admiral 
and mrs croft were generally out of doors together interesting themselves 
in their new possessions their grass and their sheep and dawdling about 
in a way not endurable to a third person or driving out in a gig 
lately added to their establishment 
hitherto there had been but one opinion of captain wentworth 
among the musgroves and their dependencies it was unvarying 
warm admiration everywhere but this intimate footing was not more 
than established when a certain charles hayter returned among them 
to be a good deal disturbed by it and to think captain wentworth 
very much in the way 
charles hayter was the eldest of all the cousins and a very amiable 
pleasing young man between whom and henrietta there had been 
a considerable appearance of attachment previous to captain wentworth s 
introduction he was in orders and having a curacy in the neighbourhood 
where residence was not required lived at his father s house 
only two miles from uppercross a short absence from home 
had left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period 
and when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners 
and of seeing captain wentworth 
mrs musgrove and mrs hayter were sisters they had each had money 
but their marriages had made a material difference in 
their degree of consequence mr hayter had some property of his own 
but it was insignificant compared with mr musgrove s and while 
the musgroves were in the first class of society in the country 
the young hayters would from their parents inferior retired 
and unpolished way of living and their own defective education 
have been hardly in any class at all but for their connexion 
with uppercross this eldest son of course excepted who had chosen 
to be a scholar and a gentleman and who was very superior 
in cultivation and manners to all the rest 
the two families had always been on excellent terms there being no pride 
on one side and no envy on the other and only such a consciousness 
of superiority in the miss musgroves as made them pleased 
to improve their cousins charles s attentions to henrietta 
had been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation 
it would not be a great match for her but if henrietta liked him 
and henrietta did seem to like him 
henrietta fully thought so herself before captain wentworth came 
but from that time cousin charles had been very much forgotten 
which of the two sisters was preferred by captain wentworth was 
as yet quite doubtful as far as anne s observation reached 
henrietta was perhaps the prettiest louisa had the higher spirits 
and she knew not now whether the more gentle or the more lively character 
were most likely to attract him 
mr and mrs musgrove either from seeing little or from 
an entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughters 
and of all the young men who came near them seemed to leave everything 
to take its chance there was not the smallest appearance of solicitude 
or remark about them in the mansion house but it was different 
at the cottage the young couple there were more disposed 
to speculate and wonder and captain wentworth had not been above 
four or five times in the miss musgroves company and charles hayter 
had but just reappeared when anne had to listen to the opinions 
of her brother and sister as to which was the one liked best 
charles gave it for louisa mary for henrietta but quite agreeing 
that to have him marry either could be extremely delightful 
charles had never seen a pleasanter man in his life and from what 
he had once heard captain wentworth himself say was very sure that 
he had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war 
here was a fortune at once besides which there would be the chance 
of what might be done in any future war and he was sure captain wentworth 
was as likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy 
oh it would be a capital match for either of his sisters 
upon my word it would replied mary dear me if he should 
rise to any very great honours if he should ever be made a baronet 
lady wentworth sounds very well that would be a noble thing 
indeed for henrietta she would take place of me then and henrietta 
would not dislike that sir frederick and lady wentworth 
it would be but a new creation however and i never think much 
of your new creations 
it suited mary best to think henrietta the one preferred 
on the very account of charles hayter whose pretensions she wished 
to see put an end to she looked down very decidedly upon the hayters 
and thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection 
between the families renewed very sad for herself and her children 
you know said she i cannot think him at all a fit match for henrietta 
and considering the alliances which the musgroves have made 
she has no right to throw herself away i do not think any young woman 
has a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient 
to the principal part of her family and be giving bad connections 
to those who have not been used to them and pray who is charles hayter 
nothing but a country curate a most improper match for miss musgrove 
of uppercross 
her husband however would not agree with her here for besides having 
a regard for his cousin charles hayter was an eldest son 
and he saw things as an eldest son himself 
now you are taking nonsense mary was therefore his answer 
it would not be a great match for henrietta but charles has 
a very fair chance through the spicers of getting something from 
the bishop in the course of a year or two and you will please to remember 
that he is the eldest son whenever my uncle dies he steps into very 
pretty property the estate at winthrop is not less than 
two hundred and fifty acres besides the farm near taunton 
which is some of the best land in the country i grant you 
that any of them but charles would be a very shocking match for henrietta 
and indeed it could not be he is the only one that could be possible 
but he is a very good natured good sort of a fellow and whenever winthrop 
comes into his hands he will make a different sort of place of it 
and live in a very different sort of way and with that property 
he will never be a contemptible man good freehold property no no 
henrietta might do worse than marry charles hayter and if she has him 
and louisa can get captain wentworth i shall be very well satisfied 
charles may say what he pleases cried mary to anne as soon as 
he was out of the room but it would be shocking to have henrietta 
marry charles hayter a very bad thing for her and still worse 
for me and therefore it is very much to be wished that captain wentworth 
may soon put him quite out of her head and i have very little doubt 
that he has she took hardly any notice of charles hayter yesterday 
i wish you had been there to see her behaviour and as to 
captain wentworth s liking louisa as well as henrietta it is nonsense 
to say so for he certainly does like henrietta a great deal the best 
but charles is so positive i wish you had been with us yesterday 
for then you might have decided between us and i am sure you 
would have thought as i did unless you had been determined 
to give it against me 
a dinner at mr musgrove s had been the occasion when all these things 
should have been seen by anne but she had staid at home 
under the mixed plea of a headache of her own and some return 
of indisposition in little charles she had thought only of avoiding 
captain wentworth but an escape from being appealed to as umpire 
was now added to the advantages of a quiet evening 
as to captain wentworth s views she deemed it of more consequence 
that he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering 
the happiness of either sister or impeaching his own honour 
than that he should prefer henrietta to louisa or louisa to henrietta 
either of them would in all probability make him an affectionate 
good humoured wife with regard to charles hayter she had delicacy 
which must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a well meaning 
young woman and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings 
it occasioned but if henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature 
of her feelings the alternation could not be understood too soon 
charles hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him 
in his cousin s behaviour she had too old a regard for him 
to be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish 
every past hope and leave him nothing to do but to keep away 
from uppercross but there was such a change as became very alarming 
when such a man as captain wentworth was to be regarded as 
the probable because he had been absent only two sundays 
and when they parted had left her interested even to the height 
of his wishes in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy 
and obtaining that of uppercross instead it had then seemed the object 
nearest her heart that dr shirley the rector who for more than 
forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office 
but was now growing too infirm for many of them should be quite fixed 
on engaging a curate should make his curacy quite as good 
as he could afford and should give charles hayter the promise of it 
the advantage of his having to come only to uppercross instead of going 
six miles another way of his having in every respect a better curacy 
of his belonging to their dear dr shirley and of dear good dr shirley s 
being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through 
without most injurious fatigue had been a great deal even to louisa 
but had been almost everything to henrietta when he came back alas 
the zeal of the business was gone by louisa could not listen at all 
to his account of a conversation which he had just held with dr shirley 
she was at a window looking out for captain wentworth and even henrietta 
had at best only a divided attention to give and seemed to have forgotten 
all the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation 
well i am very glad indeed but i always thought you would have it 
i always thought you sure it did not appear to me that in short 
you know dr shirley must have a curate and you had secured his promise 
is he coming louisa 
one morning very soon after the dinner at the musgroves 
at which anne had not been present captain wentworth walked into 
the drawing room at the cottage where were only herself and the little 
invalid charles who was lying on the sofa 
the surprise of finding himself almost alone with anne elliot 
deprived his manners of their usual composure he started 
and could only say i thought the miss musgroves had been here 
mrs musgrove told me i should find them here before he walked 
to the window to recollect himself and feel how he ought to behave 
they are up stairs with my sister they will be down in a few moments 
i dare say had been anne s reply in all the confusion that was natural 
and if the child had not called her to come and do something for him 
she would have been out of the room the next moment and released 
captain wentworth as well as herself 
he continued at the window and after calmly and politely saying 
i hope the little boy is better was silent 
she was obliged to kneel down by the sofa and remain there 
to satisfy her patient and thus they continued a few minutes 
when to her very great satisfaction she heard some other person 
crossing the little vestibule she hoped on turning her head 
to see the master of the house but it proved to be one 
much less calculated for making matters easy charles hayter 
probably not at all better pleased by the sight of captain wentworth 
than captain wentworth had been by the sight of anne 
she only attempted to say how do you do will you not sit down 
the others will be here presently 
captain wentworth however came from his window apparently 
not ill disposed for conversation but charles hayter soon put an end 
to his attempts by seating himself near the table and taking up 
the newspaper and captain wentworth returned to his window 
another minute brought another addition the younger boy 
a remarkable stout forward child of two years old having got the door 
opened for him by some one without made his determined appearance 
among them and went straight to the sofa to see what was going on 
and put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away 
there being nothing to eat he could only have some play 
and as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother 
he began to fasten himself upon her as she knelt in such a way that 
busy as she was about charles she could not shake him off 
she spoke to him ordered entreated and insisted in vain 
once she did contrive to push him away but the boy had 
the greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly 
walter said she get down this moment you are extremely troublesome 
i am very angry with you 
walter cried charles hayter why do you not do as you are bid 
do not you hear your aunt speak come to me walter come to 
cousin charles 
but not a bit did walter stir 
in another moment however she found herself in the state of 
being released from him some one was taking him from her 
though he had bent down her head so much that his little sturdy hands 
were unfastened from around her neck and he was resolutely borne away 
before she knew that captain wentworth had done it 
her sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless 
she could not even thank him she could only hang over little charles 
with most disordered feelings his kindness in stepping forward 
to her relief the manner the silence in which it had passed 
the little particulars of the circumstance with the conviction soon 
forced on her by the noise he was studiously making with the child 
that he meant to avoid hearing her thanks and rather sought 
to testify that her conversation was the last of his wants 
produced such a confusion of varying but very painful agitation 
as she could not recover from till enabled by the entrance of mary 
and the miss musgroves to make over her little patient to their cares 
and leave the room she could not stay it might have been 
an opportunity of watching the loves and jealousies of the four 
they were now altogether but she could stay for none of it 
it was evident that charles hayter was not well inclined towards 
captain wentworth she had a strong impression of his having said 
in a vext tone of voice after captain wentworth s interference 
you ought to have minded me walter i told you not to teaze your aunt 
and could comprehend his regretting that captain wentworth should do 
what he ought to have done himself but neither charles hayter s feelings 
nor anybody s feelings could interest her till she had a little better 
arranged her own she was ashamed of herself quite ashamed 
of being so nervous so overcome by such a trifle but so it was 
and it required a long application of solitude and reflection 
to recover her 
chapter 
other opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur 
anne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough 
to have an opinion though too wise to acknowledge as much at home 
where she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife 
for while she considered louisa to be rather the favourite 
she could not but think as far as she might dare to judge from memory 
and experience that captain wentworth was not in love with either 
they were more in love with him yet there it was not love 
it was a little fever of admiration but it might probably must 
end in love with some charles hayter seemed aware of being slighted 
and yet henrietta had sometimes the air of being divided between them 
anne longed for the power of representing to them all what they were about 
and of pointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves to 
she did not attribute guile to any it was the highest satisfaction 
to her to believe captain wentworth not in the least aware 
of the pain he was occasioning there was no triumph no pitiful triumph 
in his manner he had probably never heard and never thought of 
any claims of charles hayter he was only wrong in accepting 
the attentions for accepting must be the word of two young women at once 
after a short struggle however charles hayter seemed to quit the field 
three days had passed without his coming once to uppercross 
a most decided change he had even refused one regular invitation to dinner 
and having been found on the occasion by mr musgrove with some large books 
before him mr and mrs musgrove were sure all could not be right 
and talked with grave faces of his studying himself to death 
it was mary s hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissal 
from henrietta and her husband lived under the constant dependence 
of seeing him to morrow anne could only feel that charles hayter 
was wise 
one morning about this time charles musgrove and captain wentworth 
being gone a shooting together as the sisters in the cottage 
were sitting quietly at work they were visited at the window 
by the sisters from the mansion house 
it was a very fine november day and the miss musgroves came 
through the little grounds and stopped for no other purpose than to say 
that they were going to take a long walk and therefore concluded 
mary could not like to go with them and when mary immediately replied 
with some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker oh yes 
i should like to join you very much i am very fond of a long walk 
anne felt persuaded by the looks of the two girls that it was precisely 
what they did not wish and admired again the sort of necessity 
which the family habits seemed to produce of everything being 
to be communicated and everything being to be done together 
however undesired and inconvenient she tried to dissuade mary from going 
but in vain and that being the case thought it best to accept 
the miss musgroves much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise 
as she might be useful in turning back with her sister and lessening 
the interference in any plan of their own 
i cannot imagine why they should suppose i should not like a long walk 
said mary as she went up stairs everybody is always supposing 
that i am not a good walker and yet they would not have been pleased 
if we had refused to join them when people come in this manner 
on purpose to ask us how can one say no 
just as they were setting off the gentlemen returned they had taken out 
a young dog who had spoilt their sport and sent them back early 
their time and strength and spirits were therefore exactly ready 
for this walk and they entered into it with pleasure could anne 
have foreseen such a junction she would have staid at home but 
from some feelings of interest and curiosity she fancied now that it was 
too late to retract and the whole six set forward together 
in the direction chosen by the miss musgroves who evidently 
considered the walk as under their guidance 
anne s object was not to be in the way of anybody and where 
the narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary 
to keep with her brother and sister her pleasure in the walk 
must arise from the exercise and the day from the view of 
the last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves and withered hedges 
and from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical 
descriptions extant of autumn that season of peculiar and 
inexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness 
that season which had drawn from every poet worthy of being read 
some attempt at description or some lines of feeling 
she occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings 
and quotations but it was not possible that when within reach 
of captain wentworth s conversation with either of the miss musgroves 
she should not try to hear it yet she caught little very remarkable 
it was mere lively chat such as any young persons on an intimate footing 
might fall into he was more engaged with louisa than with henrietta 
louisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister 
this distinction appeared to increase and there was one speech 
of louisa s which struck her after one of the many praises of the day 
which were continually bursting forth captain wentworth added 
what glorious weather for the admiral and my sister they meant to take 
a long drive this morning perhaps we may hail them from 
some of these hills they talked of coming into this side of the country 
i wonder whereabouts they will upset to day oh it does happen 
very often i assure you but my sister makes nothing of it 
she would as lieve be tossed out as not 
ah you make the most of it i know cried louisa but if it were 
really so i should do just the same in her place if i loved a man 
as she loves the admiral i would always be with him nothing should ever 
separate us and i would rather be overturned by him than driven safely 
by anybody else 
it was spoken with enthusiasm 
had you cried he catching the same tone i honour you 
and there was silence between them for a little while 
anne could not immediately fall into a quotation again the sweet scenes 
of autumn were for a while put by unless some tender sonnet 
fraught with the apt analogy of the declining year with declining 
happiness and the images of youth and hope and spring all gone together 
blessed her memory she roused herself to say as they struck by order 
into another path is not this one of the ways to winthrop 
but nobody heard or at least nobody answered her 
winthrop however or its environs for young men are sometimes 
to be met with strolling about near home was their destination 
and after another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures 
where the ploughs at work and the fresh made path spoke the farmer 
counteracting the sweets of poetical despondence and meaning 
to have spring again they gained the summit of the most considerable hill 
which parted uppercross and winthrop and soon commanded a full view 
of the latter at the foot of the hill on the other side 
winthrop without beauty and without dignity was stretched before them 
an indifferent house standing low and hemmed in by the barns and 
buildings of a farm yard 
mary exclaimed bless me here is winthrop i declare i had no idea 
well now i think we had better turn back i am excessively tired 
henrietta conscious and ashamed and seeing no cousin charles 
walking along any path or leaning against any gate was ready 
to do as mary wished but no said charles musgrove and no no 
cried louisa more eagerly and taking her sister aside seemed to be 
arguing the matter warmly 
charles in the meanwhile was very decidedly declaring his resolution 
of calling on his aunt now that he was so near and very evidently 
though more fearfully trying to induce his wife to go too 
but this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength 
and when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter 
of an hour at winthrop as she felt so tired she resolutely answered 
oh no indeed walking up that hill again would do her more harm 
than any sitting down could do her good and in short 
her look and manner declared that go she would not 
after a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations 
it was settled between charles and his two sisters that he 
and henrietta should just run down for a few minutes to see their aunt 
and cousins while the rest of the party waited for them at the top 
of the hill louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan 
and as she went a little way with them down the hill still talking 
to henrietta mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her 
and saying to captain wentworth 
it is very unpleasant having such connexions but i assure you 
i have never been in the house above twice in my life 
she received no other answer than an artificial assenting smile 
followed by a contemptuous glance as he turned away which anne 
perfectly knew the meaning of 
the brow of the hill where they remained was a cheerful spot 
louisa returned and mary finding a comfortable seat for herself 
on the step of a stile was very well satisfied so long as the others 
all stood about her but when louisa drew captain wentworth away 
to try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge row 
and they were gone by degrees quite out of sight and sound 
mary was happy no longer she quarrelled with her own seat 
was sure louisa had got a much better somewhere and nothing could 
prevent her from going to look for a better also she turned through 
the same gate but could not see them anne found a nice seat 
for her on a dry sunny bank under the hedge row in which 
she had no doubt of their still being in some spot or other 
mary sat down for a moment but it would not do she was sure louisa 
had found a better seat somewhere else and she would go on 
till she overtook her 
anne really tired herself was glad to sit down and she very soon heard 
captain wentworth and louisa in the hedge row behind her as if 
making their way back along the rough wild sort of channel down the 
centre they were speaking as they drew near louisa s voice was 
the first distinguished she seemed to be in the middle of some 
eager speech what anne first heard was 
and so i made her go i could not bear that she should be frightened 
from the visit by such nonsense what would i be turned back from 
doing a thing that i had determined to do and that i knew to be right 
by the airs and interference of such a person or of any person i may say 
no i have no idea of being so easily persuaded when i have 
made up my mind i have made it and henrietta seemed entirely 
to have made up hers to call at winthrop to day and yet she was as near 
giving it up out of nonsensical complaisance 
she would have turned back then but for you 
she would indeed i am almost ashamed to say it 
happy for her to have such a mind as yours at hand after the hints 
you gave just now which did but confirm my own observations 
the last time i was in company with him i need not affect 
to have no comprehension of what is going on i see that more than 
a mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question 
and woe betide him and her too when it comes to things of consequence 
when they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and 
strength of mind if she have not resolution enough to resist 
idle interference in such a trifle as this your sister is 
an amiable creature but yours is the character of decision and firmness 
i see if you value her conduct or happiness infuse as much 
of your own spirit into her as you can but this no doubt 
you have been always doing it is the worst evil of too yielding 
and indecisive a character that no influence over it can be depended on 
you are never sure of a good impression being durable everybody 
may sway it let those who would be happy be firm here is a nut 
said he catching one down from an upper bough to exemplify 
a beautiful glossy nut which blessed with original strength 
has outlived all the storms of autumn not a puncture not 
a weak spot anywhere this nut he continued with playful solemnity 
while so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot 
is still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be 
supposed capable of then returning to his former earnest tone 
my first wish for all whom i am interested in is that they should be firm 
if louisa musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her november of life 
she will cherish all her present powers of mind 
he had done and was unanswered it would have surprised anne if louisa 
could have readily answered such a speech words of such interest 
spoken with such serious warmth she could imagine what louisa was feeling 
for herself she feared to move lest she should be seen 
while she remained a bush of low rambling holly protected her 
and they were moving on before they were beyond her hearing 
however louisa spoke again 
mary is good natured enough in many respects said she 
but she does sometimes provoke me excessively by her nonsense 
and pride the elliot pride she has a great deal too much 
of the elliot pride we do so wish that charles had married anne instead 
i suppose you know he wanted to marry anne 
after a moment s pause captain wentworth said 
do you mean that she refused him 
oh yes certainly 
when did that happen 
i do not exactly know for henrietta and i were at school at the time 
but i believe about a year before he married mary i wish she had 
accepted him we should all have liked her a great deal better 
and papa and mamma always think it was her great friend 
lady russell s doing that she did not they think charles 
might not be learned and bookish enough to please lady russell 
and that therefore she persuaded anne to refuse him 
the sounds were retreating and anne distinguished no more 
her own emotions still kept her fixed she had much to recover from 
before she could move the listener s proverbial fate was 
not absolutely hers she had heard no evil of herself but she had heard 
a great deal of very painful import she saw how her own character 
was considered by captain wentworth and there had been just that degree 
of feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her 
extreme agitation 
as soon as she could she went after mary and having found 
and walked back with her to their former station by the stile 
felt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards 
collected and once more in motion together her spirits wanted 
the solitude and silence which only numbers could give 
charles and henrietta returned bringing as may be conjectured 
charles hayter with them the minutiae of the business anne 
could not attempt to understand even captain wentworth did not seem 
admitted to perfect confidence here but that there had been a withdrawing 
on the gentleman s side and a relenting on the lady s and that they 
were now very glad to be together again did not admit a doubt 
henrietta looked a little ashamed but very well pleased 
charles hayter exceedingly happy and they were devoted to each other 
almost from the first instant of their all setting forward for uppercross 
everything now marked out louisa for captain wentworth 
nothing could be plainer and where many divisions were necessary 
or even where they were not they walked side by side nearly as much 
as the other two in a long strip of meadow land where there was 
ample space for all they were thus divided forming three distinct parties 
and to that party of the three which boasted least animation 
and least complaisance anne necessarily belonged she joined charles 
and mary and was tired enough to be very glad of charles s other arm 
but charles though in very good humour with her was out of temper 
with his wife mary had shewn herself disobliging to him 
and was now to reap the consequence which consequence was 
his dropping her arm almost every moment to cut off the heads 
of some nettles in the hedge with his switch and when mary began 
to complain of it and lament her being ill used according to custom 
in being on the hedge side while anne was never incommoded on the other 
he dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which he had 
a momentary glance of and they could hardly get him along at all 
this long meadow bordered a lane which their footpath at the end of it 
was to cross and when the party had all reached the gate of exit 
the carriage advancing in the same direction which had been 
some time heard was just coming up and proved to be admiral croft s gig 
he and his wife had taken their intended drive and were returning home 
upon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in 
they kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired 
it would save her a full mile and they were going through uppercross 
the invitation was general and generally declined the miss musgroves 
were not at all tired and mary was either offended by not being asked 
before any of the others or what louisa called the elliot pride 
could not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise 
the walking party had crossed the lane and were surmounting an 
opposite stile and the admiral was putting his horse in motion again 
when captain wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something 
to his sister the something might be guessed by its effects 
miss elliot i am sure you are tired cried mrs croft 
do let us have the pleasure of taking you home here is excellent room 
for three i assure you if we were all like you i believe we might 
sit four you must indeed you must 
anne was still in the lane and though instinctively beginning to decline 
she was not allowed to proceed the admiral s kind urgency 
came in support of his wife s they would not be refused 
they compressed themselves into the smallest possible space 
to leave her a corner and captain wentworth without saying a word 
turned to her and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage 
yes he had done it she was in the carriage and felt that he had 
placed her there that his will and his hands had done it 
that she owed it to his perception of her fatigue and his resolution 
to give her rest she was very much affected by the view of 
his disposition towards her which all these things made apparent 
this little circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before 
she understood him he could not forgive her but he could not 
be unfeeling though condemning her for the past and considering it 
with high and unjust resentment though perfectly careless of her 
and though becoming attached to another still he could not see her suffer 
without the desire of giving her relief it was a remainder 
of former sentiment it was an impulse of pure though unacknowledged 
friendship it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart 
which she could not contemplate without emotions so compounded 
of pleasure and pain that she knew not which prevailed 
her answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions 
were at first unconsciously given they had travelled half their way 
along the rough lane before she was quite awake to what they said 
she then found them talking of frederick 
he certainly means to have one or other of those two girls sophy 
said the admiral but there is no saying which he has been 
running after them too long enough one would think to make up his mind 
ay this comes of the peace if it were war now he would have 
settled it long ago we sailors miss elliot cannot afford to make 
long courtships in time of war how many days was it my dear 
between the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together 
in our lodgings at north yarmouth 
we had better not talk about it my dear replied mrs croft pleasantly 
for if miss elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding 
she would never be persuaded that we could be happy together 
i had known you by character however long before 
well and i had heard of you as a very pretty girl and what were we 
to wait for besides i do not like having such things so long in hand 
i wish frederick would spread a little more canvass and bring us home 
one of these young ladies to kellynch then there would always 
be company for them and very nice young ladies they both are 
i hardly know one from the other 
very good humoured unaffected girls indeed said mrs croft 
in a tone of calmer praise such as made anne suspect that 
her keener powers might not consider either of them as quite worthy 
of her brother and a very respectable family one could not be 
connected with better people my dear admiral that post 
we shall certainly take that post 
but by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily 
passed the danger and by once afterwards judiciously putting out 
her hand they neither fell into a rut nor ran foul of a dung cart 
and anne with some amusement at their style of driving 
which she imagined no bad representation of the general guidance 
of their affairs found herself safely deposited by them at the cottage 
chapter 
the time now approached for lady russell s return the day was even fixed 
and anne being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettled 
was looking forward to an early removal to kellynch and beginning 
to think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it 
it would place her in the same village with captain wentworth 
within half a mile of him they would have to frequent the same church 
and there must be intercourse between the two families 
this was against her but on the other hand he spent so much of his time 
at uppercross that in removing thence she might be considered rather 
as leaving him behind than as going towards him and upon the whole 
she believed she must on this interesting question be the gainer 
almost as certainly as in her change of domestic society 
in leaving poor mary for lady russell 
she wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing 
captain wentworth at the hall those rooms had witnessed 
former meetings which would be brought too painfully before her 
but she was yet more anxious for the possibility of lady russell and 
captain wentworth never meeting anywhere they did not like each other 
and no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good and were lady russell 
to see them together she might think that he had too much self possession 
and she too little 
these points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating 
her removal from uppercross where she felt she had been stationed 
quite long enough her usefulness to little charles would always 
give some sweetness to the memory of her two months visit there 
but he was gaining strength apace and she had nothing else to stay for 
the conclusion of her visit however was diversified in a way 
which she had not at all imagined captain wentworth after being unseen 
and unheard of at uppercross for two whole days appeared again among them 
to justify himself by a relation of what had kept him away 
a letter from his friend captain harville having found him out at last 
had brought intelligence of captain harville s being settled 
with his family at lyme for the winter of their being therefore 
quite unknowingly within twenty miles of each other captain harville 
had never been in good health since a severe wound which he received 
two years before and captain wentworth s anxiety to see him 
had determined him to go immediately to lyme he had been there 
for four and twenty hours his acquittal was complete 
his friendship warmly honoured a lively interest excited for his friend 
and his description of the fine country about lyme so feelingly attended to 
by the party that an earnest desire to see lyme themselves 
and a project for going thither was the consequence 
the young people were all wild to see lyme captain wentworth talked 
of going there again himself it was only seventeen miles from uppercross 
though november the weather was by no means bad and in short 
louisa who was the most eager of the eager having formed 
the resolution to go and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked 
being now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way 
bore down all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off 
till summer and to lyme they were to go charles mary anne henrietta 
louisa and captain wentworth 
the first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night 
but to this mr musgrove for the sake of his horses would not consent 
and when it came to be rationally considered a day in 
the middle of november would not leave much time for seeing a new place 
after deducting seven hours as the nature of the country required 
for going and returning they were consequently to stay the night there 
and not to be expected back till the next day s dinner this was felt 
to be a considerable amendment and though they all met at the great house 
at rather an early breakfast hour and set off very punctually 
it was so much past noon before the two carriages mr musgrove s coach 
containing the four ladies and charles s curricle in which 
he drove captain wentworth were descending the long hill into lyme 
and entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself 
that it was very evident they would not have more than time 
for looking about them before the light and warmth of the day were gone 
after securing accommodations and ordering a dinner at one of the inns 
the next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly 
down to the sea they were come too late in the year for any amusement 
or variety which lyme as a public place might offer the rooms 
were shut up the lodgers almost all gone scarcely any family 
but of the residents left and as there is nothing to admire 
in the buildings themselves the remarkable situation of the town 
the principal street almost hurrying into the water the walk to the cobb 
skirting round the pleasant little bay which in the season 
is animated with bathing machines and company the cobb itself 
its old wonders and new improvements with the very beautiful 
line of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town are what 
the stranger s eye will seek and a very strange stranger it must be 
who does not see charms in the immediate environs of lyme 
to make him wish to know it better the scenes in its neighbourhood 
charmouth with its high grounds and extensive sweeps of country 
and still more its sweet retired bay backed by dark cliffs 
where fragments of low rock among the sands make it the happiest spot 
for watching the flow of the tide for sitting in unwearied contemplation 
the woody varieties of the cheerful village of up lyme and above all 
pinny with its green chasms between romantic rocks where 
the scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth 
declare that many a generation must have passed away since the first 
partial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a state 
where a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited as may 
more than equal any of the resembling scenes of the far famed 
isle of wight these places must be visited and visited again 
to make the worth of lyme understood 
the party from uppercross passing down by the now deserted 
and melancholy looking rooms and still descending soon found themselves 
on the sea shore and lingering only as all must linger and gaze 
on a first return to the sea who ever deserved to look on it at all 
proceeded towards the cobb equally their object in itself 
and on captain wentworth s account for in a small house 
near the foot of an old pier of unknown date were the harvilles settled 
captain wentworth turned in to call on his friend the others walked on 
and he was to join them on the cobb 
they were by no means tired of wondering and admiring and not even louisa 
seemed to feel that they had parted with captain wentworth long 
when they saw him coming after them with three companions 
all well known already by description to be captain and mrs harville 
and a captain benwick who was staying with them 
captain benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the laconia 
and the account which captain wentworth had given of him 
on his return from lyme before his warm praise of him as 
an excellent young man and an officer whom he had always valued highly 
which must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener 
had been followed by a little history of his private life 
which rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies 
he had been engaged to captain harville s sister and was now 
mourning her loss they had been a year or two waiting for fortune 
and promotion fortune came his prize money as lieutenant being great 
promotion too came at last but fanny harville did not live to know it 
she had died the preceding summer while he was at sea captain wentworth 
believed it impossible for man to be more attached to woman 
than poor benwick had been to fanny harville or to be more deeply 
afflicted under the dreadful change he considered his disposition 
as of the sort which must suffer heavily uniting very strong feelings 
with quiet serious and retiring manners and a decided taste for reading 
and sedentary pursuits to finish the interest of the story 
the friendship between him and the harvilles seemed if possible 
augmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance 
and captain benwick was now living with them entirely captain harville 
had taken his present house for half a year his taste and his health 
and his fortune all directing him to a residence inexpensive 
and by the sea and the grandeur of the country and the retirement 
of lyme in the winter appeared exactly adapted to captain benwick s 
state of mind the sympathy and good will excited towards captain benwick 
was very great 
and yet said anne to herself as they now moved forward 
to meet the party he has not perhaps a more sorrowing heart 
than i have i cannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever 
he is younger than i am younger in feeling if not in fact 
younger as a man he will rally again and be happy with another 
they all met and were introduced captain harville was a tall 
dark man with a sensible benevolent countenance a little lame 
and from strong features and want of health looking much older 
than captain wentworth captain benwick looked and was 
the youngest of the three and compared with either of them 
a little man he had a pleasing face and a melancholy air 
just as he ought to have and drew back from conversation 
captain harville though not equalling captain wentworth in manners 
was a perfect gentleman unaffected warm and obliging 
mrs harville a degree less polished than her husband seemed however 
to have the same good feelings and nothing could be more pleasant 
than their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own 
because the friends of captain wentworth or more kindly hospitable 
than their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them 
the dinner already ordered at the inn was at last though unwillingly 
accepted as a excuse but they seemed almost hurt that captain wentworth 
should have brought any such party to lyme without considering it 
as a thing of course that they should dine with them 
there was so much attachment to captain wentworth in all this 
and such a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon 
so unlike the usual style of give and take invitations and dinners 
of formality and display that anne felt her spirits not likely to be 
benefited by an increasing acquaintance among his brother officers 
these would have been all my friends was her thought 
and she had to struggle against a great tendency to lowness 
on quitting the cobb they all went in doors with their new friends 
and found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart 
could think capable of accommodating so many anne had 
a moment s astonishment on the subject herself but it was soon lost 
in the pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all 
the ingenious contrivances and nice arrangements of captain harville 
to turn the actual space to the best account to supply the deficiencies 
of lodging house furniture and defend the windows and doors 
against the winter storms to be expected the varieties in 
the fitting up of the rooms where the common necessaries 
provided by the owner in the common indifferent plight 
were contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood 
excellently worked up and with something curious and valuable 
from all the distant countries captain harville had visited 
were more than amusing to anne connected as it all was with his profession 
the fruit of its labours the effect of its influence on his habits 
the picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented 
made it to her a something more or less than gratification 
captain harville was no reader but he had contrived 
excellent accommodations and fashioned very pretty shelves 
for a tolerable collection of well bound volumes the property of 
captain benwick his lameness prevented him from taking much exercise 
but a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with 
constant employment within he drew he varnished he carpentered 
he glued he made toys for the children he fashioned new netting needles 
and pins with improvements and if everything else was done 
sat down to his large fishing net at one corner of the room 
anne thought she left great happiness behind her when they 
quitted the house and louisa by whom she found herself walking 
burst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character 
of the navy their friendliness their brotherliness their openness 
their uprightness protesting that she was convinced of sailors having 
more worth and warmth than any other set of men in england 
that they only knew how to live and they only deserved to be 
respected and loved 
they went back to dress and dine and so well had the scheme 
answered already that nothing was found amiss though its being 
so entirely out of season and the no thoroughfare of lyme 
and the no expectation of company had brought many apologies 
from the heads of the inn 
anne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened 
to being in captain wentworth s company than she had at first imagined 
could ever be that the sitting down to the same table with him now 
and the interchange of the common civilities attending on it 
they never got beyond was become a mere nothing 
the nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow 
but captain harville had promised them a visit in the evening 
and he came bringing his friend also which was more than 
had been expected it having been agreed that captain benwick 
had all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of 
so many strangers he ventured among them again however 
though his spirits certainly did not seem fit for the mirth 
of the party in general 
while captains wentworth and harville led the talk on one side of the room 
and by recurring to former days supplied anecdotes in abundance 
to occupy and entertain the others it fell to anne s lot to be placed 
rather apart with captain benwick and a very good impulse 
of her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him 
he was shy and disposed to abstraction but the engaging mildness of 
her countenance and gentleness of her manners soon had their effect 
and anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion 
he was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading 
though principally in poetry and besides the persuasion of having 
given him at least an evening s indulgence in the discussion of subjects 
which his usual companions had probably no concern in she had the hope 
of being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and 
benefit of struggling against affliction which had naturally grown out 
of their conversation for though shy he did not seem reserved 
it had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their 
usual restraints and having talked of poetry the richness of 
the present age and gone through a brief comparison of opinion 
as to the first rate poets trying to ascertain whether marmion 
or the lady of the lake were to be preferred and how ranked the giaour 
and the bride of abydos and moreover how the giaour was to be pronounced 
he showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs 
of the one poet and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony 
of the other he repeated with such tremulous feeling the various lines 
which imaged a broken heart or a mind destroyed by wretchedness 
and looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood 
that she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry 
and to say that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be 
seldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely 
and that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly 
were the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly 
his looks shewing him not pained but pleased with this allusion 
to his situation she was emboldened to go on and feeling in herself 
the right of seniority of mind she ventured to recommend 
a larger allowance of prose in his daily study and on being requested 
to particularize mentioned such works of our best moralists 
such collections of the finest letters such memoirs of characters 
of worth and suffering as occurred to her at the moment 
as calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts 
and the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances 
captain benwick listened attentively and seemed grateful for 
the interest implied and though with a shake of the head 
and sighs which declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books 
on grief like his noted down the names of those she recommended 
and promised to procure and read them 
when the evening was over anne could not but be amused at the idea 
of her coming to lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man 
whom she had never seen before nor could she help fearing 
on more serious reflection that like many other great moralists 
and preachers she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct 
would ill bear examination 
chapter 
anne and henrietta finding themselves the earliest of the party 
the next morning agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast 
they went to the sands to watch the flowing of the tide 
which a fine south easterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur 
which so flat a shore admitted they praised the morning 
gloried in the sea sympathized in the delight of the fresh feeling 
breeze and were silent till henrietta suddenly began again with 
oh yes i am quite convinced that with very few exceptions 
the sea air always does good there can be no doubt of its having been 
of the greatest service to dr shirley after his illness 
last spring twelve month he declares himself that coming to lyme 
for a month did him more good than all the medicine he took 
and that being by the sea always makes him feel young again 
now i cannot help thinking it a pity that he does not live 
entirely by the sea i do think he had better leave uppercross entirely 
and fix at lyme do not you anne do not you agree with me 
that it is the best thing he could do both for himself and mrs shirley 
she has cousins here you know and many acquaintance which would 
make it cheerful for her and i am sure she would be glad 
to get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand 
in case of his having another seizure indeed i think it quite melancholy 
to have such excellent people as dr and mrs shirley who have been 
doing good all their lives wearing out their last days in a place 
like uppercross where excepting our family they seem shut out 
from all the world i wish his friends would propose it to him 
i really think they ought and as to procuring a dispensation 
there could be no difficulty at his time of life and with his character 
my only doubt is whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish 
he is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions over scrupulous 
i must say do not you think anne it is being over scrupulous 
do not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience 
when a clergyman sacrifices his health for the sake of duties 
which may be just as well performed by another person and at lyme too 
only seventeen miles off he would be near enough to hear 
if people thought there was anything to complain of 
anne smiled more than once to herself during this speech 
and entered into the subject as ready to do good by entering into 
the feelings of a young lady as of a young man though here it was good 
of a lower standard for what could be offered but general acquiescence 
she said all that was reasonable and proper on the business 
felt the claims of dr shirley to repose as she ought saw how very 
desirable it was that he should have some active respectable young man 
as a resident curate and was even courteous enough to hint at 
the advantage of such resident curate s being married 
i wish said henrietta very well pleased with her companion 
i wish lady russell lived at uppercross and were intimate 
with dr shirley i have always heard of lady russell as a woman of 
the greatest influence with everybody i always look upon her as able 
to persuade a person to anything i am afraid of her as i have 
told you before quite afraid of her because she is so very clever 
but i respect her amazingly and wish we had such a neighbour 
at uppercross 
anne was amused by henrietta s manner of being grateful 
and amused also that the course of events and the new interests 
of henrietta s views should have placed her friend at all in favour 
with any of the musgrove family she had only time however 
for a general answer and a wish that such another woman 
were at uppercross before all subjects suddenly ceased 
on seeing louisa and captain wentworth coming towards them 
they came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be ready 
but louisa recollecting immediately afterwards that she had something 
to procure at a shop invited them all to go back with her into the town 
they were all at her disposal 
when they came to the steps leading upwards from the beach a gentleman 
at the same moment preparing to come down politely drew back 
and stopped to give them way they ascended and passed him 
and as they passed anne s face caught his eye and he looked at her 
with a degree of earnest admiration which she could not be insensible of 
she was looking remarkably well her very regular very pretty features 
having the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind 
which had been blowing on her complexion and by the animation of eye 
which it had also produced it was evident that the gentleman 
completely a gentleman in manner admired her exceedingly 
captain wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which 
shewed his noticing of it he gave her a momentary glance 
a glance of brightness which seemed to say that man is struck with you 
and even i at this moment see something like anne elliot again 
after attending louisa through her business and loitering about 
a little longer they returned to the inn and anne in passing afterwards 
quickly from her own chamber to their dining room had nearly run against 
the very same gentleman as he came out of an adjoining apartment 
she had before conjectured him to be a stranger like themselves 
and determined that a well looking groom who was strolling about 
near the two inns as they came back should be his servant 
both master and man being in mourning assisted the idea 
it was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves 
and this second meeting short as it was also proved again 
by the gentleman s looks that he thought hers very lovely 
and by the readiness and propriety of his apologies that he was 
a man of exceedingly good manners he seemed about thirty 
and though not handsome had an agreeable person anne felt that 
she should like to know who he was 
they had nearly done breakfast when the sound of a carriage 
almost the first they had heard since entering lyme drew half the party 
to the window it was a gentleman s carriage a curricle 
but only coming round from the stable yard to the front door 
somebody must be going away it was driven by a servant in mourning 
the word curricle made charles musgrove jump up that he might 
compare it with his own the servant in mourning roused anne s curiosity 
and the whole six were collected to look by the time the owner 
of the curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows 
and civilities of the household and taking his seat to drive off 
ah cried captain wentworth instantly and with half a glance at anne 
it is the very man we passed 
the miss musgroves agreed to it and having all kindly watched him 
as far up the hill as they could they returned to the breakfast table 
the waiter came into the room soon afterwards 
pray said captain wentworth immediately can you tell us the name 
of the gentleman who is just gone away 
yes sir a mr elliot a gentleman of large fortune came in last night 
from sidmouth dare say you heard the carriage sir while you were 
at dinner and going on now for crewkherne in his way to bath 
and london 
elliot many had looked on each other and many had repeated the name 
before all this had been got through even by the smart rapidity 
of a waiter 
bless me cried mary it must be our cousin it must be our mr elliot 
it must indeed charles anne must not it in mourning you see 
just as our mr elliot must be how very extraordinary 
in the very same inn with us anne must not it be our mr elliot 
my father s next heir pray sir turning to the waiter 
did not you hear did not his servant say whether he belonged 
to the kellynch family 
no madam he did not mention no particular family but he said 
his master was a very rich gentleman and would be a baronight some day 
there you see cried mary in an ecstasy just as i said 
heir to sir walter elliot i was sure that would come out 
if it was so depend upon it that is a circumstance which his servants 
take care to publish wherever he goes but anne only conceive 
how extraordinary i wish i had looked at him more i wish we had 
been aware in time who it was that he might have been introduced to us 
what a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other 
do you think he had the elliot countenance i hardly looked at him 
i was looking at the horses but i think he had something 
of the elliot countenance i wonder the arms did not strike me 
oh the great coat was hanging over the panel and hid the arms 
so it did otherwise i am sure i should have observed them 
and the livery too if the servant had not been in mourning 
one should have known him by the livery 
putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together 
said captain wentworth we must consider it to be the arrangement 
of providence that you should not be introduced to your cousin 
when she could command mary s attention anne quietly tried 
to convince her that their father and mr elliot had not for many years 
been on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction 
at all desirable 
at the same time however it was a secret gratification to herself 
to have seen her cousin and to know that the future owner of kellynch 
was undoubtedly a gentleman and had an air of good sense 
she would not upon any account mention her having met with him 
the second time luckily mary did not much attend to their having 
passed close by him in their earlier walk but she would have felt 
quite ill used by anne s having actually run against him in the passage 
and received his very polite excuses while she had never been 
near him at all no that cousinly little interview must remain 
a perfect secret 
of course said mary you will mention our seeing mr elliot 
the next time you write to bath i think my father certainly 
ought to hear of it do mention all about him 
anne avoided a direct reply but it was just the circumstance 
which she considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated 
but as what ought to be suppressed the offence which had been given 
her father many years back she knew elizabeth s particular share in it 
she suspected and that mr elliot s idea always produced irritation in both 
was beyond a doubt mary never wrote to bath herself all the toil 
of keeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with elizabeth 
fell on anne 
breakfast had not been long over when they were joined by captain 
and mrs harville and captain benwick with whom they had appointed 
to take their last walk about lyme they ought to be setting off 
for uppercross by one and in the mean while were to be all together 
and out of doors as long as they could 
anne found captain benwick getting near her as soon as they were all 
fairly in the street their conversation the preceding evening 
did not disincline him to seek her again and they walked together 
some time talking as before of mr scott and lord byron 
and still as unable as before and as unable as any other two readers 
to think exactly alike of the merits of either till something 
occasioned an almost general change amongst their party and instead of 
captain benwick she had captain harville by her side 
miss elliot said he speaking rather low you have done a good deed 
in making that poor fellow talk so much i wish he could have 
such company oftener it is bad for him i know to be shut up as he is 
but what can we do we cannot part 
no said anne that i can easily believe to be impossible 
but in time perhaps we know what time does in every case of affliction 
and you must remember captain harville that your friend 
may yet be called a young mourner only last summer i understand 
ay true enough with a deep sigh only june 
and not known to him perhaps so soon 
not till the first week of august when he came home from the cape 
just made into the grappler i was at plymouth dreading to hear of him 
he sent in letters but the grappler was under orders for portsmouth 
there the news must follow him but who was to tell it not i 
i would as soon have been run up to the yard arm nobody could do it 
but that good fellow pointing to captain wentworth the laconia 
had come into plymouth the week before no danger of her 
being sent to sea again he stood his chance for the rest 
wrote up for leave of absence but without waiting the return 
travelled night and day till he got to portsmouth rowed off 
to the grappler that instant and never left the poor fellow for a week 
that is what he did and nobody else could have saved poor james 
you may think miss elliot whether he is dear to us 
anne did think on the question with perfect decision and said as much 
in reply as her own feeling could accomplish or as his seemed 
able to bear for he was too much affected to renew the subject 
and when he spoke again it was of something totally different 
mrs harville s giving it as her opinion that her husband would have 
quite walking enough by the time he reached home determined the direction 
of all the party in what was to be their last walk they would 
accompany them to their door and then return and set off themselves 
by all their calculations there was just time for this but as they drew 
near the cobb there was such a general wish to walk along it once more 
all were so inclined and louisa soon grew so determined 
that the difference of a quarter of an hour it was found 
would be no difference at all so with all the kind leave taking 
and all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which 
may be imagined they parted from captain and mrs harville 
at their own door and still accompanied by captain benwick 
who seemed to cling to them to the last proceeded to make 
the proper adieus to the cobb 
anne found captain benwick again drawing near her lord byron s 
dark blue seas could not fail of being brought forward by 
their present view and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as 
attention was possible it was soon drawn perforce another way 
there was too much wind to make the high part of the new cobb pleasant 
for the ladies and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower 
and all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight 
excepting louisa she must be jumped down them by captain wentworth 
in all their walks he had had to jump her from the stiles 
the sensation was delightful to her the hardness of the pavement 
for her feet made him less willing upon the present occasion 
he did it however she was safely down and instantly 
to show her enjoyment ran up the steps to be jumped down again 
he advised her against it thought the jar too great but no 
he reasoned and talked in vain she smiled and said i am determined 
i will he put out his hands she was too precipitate by half a second 
she fell on the pavement on the lower cobb and was taken up lifeless 
there was no wound no blood no visible bruise but her eyes were closed 
she breathed not her face was like death the horror of the moment 
to all who stood around 
captain wentworth who had caught her up knelt with her in his arms 
looking on her with a face as pallid as her own in an agony of silence 
she is dead she is dead screamed mary catching hold of her 
husband and contributing with his own horror to make him immoveable 
and in another moment henrietta sinking under the conviction lost 
her senses too and would have fallen on the steps but for captain 
benwick and anne who caught and supported her between them 
is there no one to help me were the first words which 
burst from captain wentworth in a tone of despair and as if 
all his own strength were gone 
go to him go to him cried anne for heaven s sake go to him 
i can support her myself leave me and go to him rub her hands 
rub her temples here are salts take them take them 
captain benwick obeyed and charles at the same moment 
disengaging himself from his wife they were both with him 
and louisa was raised up and supported more firmly between them 
and everything was done that anne had prompted but in vain 
while captain wentworth staggering against the wall for his support 
exclaimed in the bitterest agony 
oh god her father and mother 
a surgeon said anne 
he caught the word it seemed to rouse him at once and saying only 
true true a surgeon this instant was darting away 
when anne eagerly suggested 
captain benwick would not it be better for captain benwick 
he knows where a surgeon is to be found 
every one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea 
and in a moment it was all done in rapid moments captain benwick had 
resigned the poor corpse like figure entirely to the brother s care 
and was off for the town with the utmost rapidity 
as to the wretched party left behind it could scarcely be said 
which of the three who were completely rational was suffering most 
captain wentworth anne or charles who really a very affectionate 
brother hung over louisa with sobs of grief and could only turn his eyes 
from one sister to see the other in a state as insensible 
or to witness the hysterical agitations of his wife calling on him 
for help which he could not give 
anne attending with all the strength and zeal and thought 
which instinct supplied to henrietta still tried at intervals 
to suggest comfort to the others tried to quiet mary to animate charles 
to assuage the feelings of captain wentworth both seemed to look to her 
for directions 
anne anne cried charles what is to be done next 
what in heaven s name is to be done next 
captain wentworth s eyes were also turned towards her 
had not she better be carried to the inn yes i am sure 
carry her gently to the inn 
yes yes to the inn repeated captain wentworth comparatively 
collected and eager to be doing something i will carry her myself 
musgrove take care of the others 
by this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen 
and boatmen about the cobb and many were collected near them 
to be useful if wanted at any rate to enjoy the sight of 
a dead young lady nay two dead young ladies for it proved twice as fine 
as the first report to some of the best looking of these good people 
henrietta was consigned for though partially revived 
she was quite helpless and in this manner anne walking by her side 
and charles attending to his wife they set forward treading back 
with feelings unutterable the ground which so lately so very lately 
and so light of heart they had passed along 
they were not off the cobb before the harvilles met them 
captain benwick had been seen flying by their house with a countenance 
which showed something to be wrong and they had set off immediately 
informed and directed as they passed towards the spot 
shocked as captain harville was he brought senses and nerves 
that could be instantly useful and a look between him and his wife 
decided what was to be done she must be taken to their house 
all must go to their house and await the surgeon s arrival there 
they would not listen to scruples he was obeyed they were all 
beneath his roof and while louisa under mrs harville s direction 
was conveyed up stairs and given possession of her own bed 
assistance cordials restoratives were supplied by her husband 
to all who needed them 
louisa had once opened her eyes but soon closed them again 
without apparent consciousness this had been a proof of life 
however of service to her sister and henrietta though perfectly 
incapable of being in the same room with louisa was kept 
by the agitation of hope and fear from a return of her own insensibility 
mary too was growing calmer 
the surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible 
they were sick with horror while he examined but he was not hopeless 
the head had received a severe contusion but he had seen greater injuries 
recovered from he was by no means hopeless he spoke cheerfully 
that he did not regard it as a desperate case that he did not say 
a few hours must end it was at first felt beyond the hope of most 
and the ecstasy of such a reprieve the rejoicing deep and silent 
after a few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to heaven had been offered 
may be conceived 
the tone the look with which thank god was uttered 
by captain wentworth anne was sure could never be forgotten by her 
nor the sight of him afterwards as he sat near a table leaning over it 
with folded arms and face concealed as if overpowered by 
the various feelings of his soul and trying by prayer and reflection 
to calm them 
louisa s limbs had escaped there was no injury but to the head 
it now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be done 
as to their general situation they were now able to speak to each other 
and consult that louisa must remain where she was however distressing 
to her friends to be involving the harvilles in such trouble 
did not admit a doubt her removal was impossible the harvilles 
silenced all scruples and as much as they could all gratitude 
they had looked forward and arranged everything before the others 
began to reflect captain benwick must give up his room to them 
and get another bed elsewhere and the whole was settled 
they were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more 
and yet perhaps by putting the children away in the maid s room 
or swinging a cot somewhere they could hardly bear to think of not 
finding room for two or three besides supposing they might wish to stay 
though with regard to any attendance on miss musgrove there need not be 
the least uneasiness in leaving her to mrs harville s care entirely 
mrs harville was a very experienced nurse and her nursery maid 
who had lived with her long and gone about with her everywhere 
was just such another between these two she could want 
no possible attendance by day or night and all this was said 
with a truth and sincerity of feeling irresistible 
charles henrietta and captain wentworth were the three in consultation 
and for a little while it was only an interchange of perplexity and terror 
uppercross the necessity of some one s going to uppercross 
the news to be conveyed how it could be broken to mr and mrs musgrove 
the lateness of the morning an hour already gone since they 
ought to have been off the impossibility of being in tolerable time 
at first they were capable of nothing more to the purpose 
than such exclamations but after a while captain wentworth 
exerting himself said 
we must be decided and without the loss of another minute 
every minute is valuable some one must resolve on being off 
for uppercross instantly musgrove either you or i must go 
charles agreed but declared his resolution of not going away 
he would be as little incumbrance as possible to captain and mrs harville 
but as to leaving his sister in such a state he neither ought nor would 
so far it was decided and henrietta at first declared the same 
she however was soon persuaded to think differently the usefulness 
of her staying she who had not been able to remain in louisa s room 
or to look at her without sufferings which made her worse than helpless 
she was forced to acknowledge that she could do no good 
yet was still unwilling to be away till touched by the thought 
of her father and mother she gave it up she consented 
she was anxious to be at home 
the plan had reached this point when anne coming quietly 
down from louisa s room could not but hear what followed 
for the parlour door was open 
then it is settled musgrove cried captain wentworth 
that you stay and that i take care of your sister home 
but as to the rest as to the others if one stays to assist mrs harville 
i think it need be only one mrs charles musgrove will of course 
wish to get back to her children but if anne will stay no one so proper 
so capable as anne 
she paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself 
so spoken of the other two warmly agreed with what he said 
and she then appeared 
you will stay i am sure you will stay and nurse her cried he 
turning to her and speaking with a glow and yet a gentleness 
which seemed almost restoring the past she coloured deeply 
and he recollected himself and moved away she expressed herself 
most willing ready happy to remain it was what she had been 
thinking of and wishing to be allowed to do a bed on the floor 
in louisa s room would be sufficient for her if mrs harville 
would but think so 
one thing more and all seemed arranged though it was rather desirable 
that mr and mrs musgrove should be previously alarmed by some 
share of delay yet the time required by the uppercross horses 
to take them back would be a dreadful extension of suspense 
and captain wentworth proposed and charles musgrove agreed 
that it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the inn 
and leave mr musgrove s carriage and horses to be sent home 
the next morning early when there would be the farther advantage 
of sending an account of louisa s night 
captain wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his part 
and to be soon followed by the two ladies when the plan was 
made known to mary however there was an end of all peace in it 
she was so wretched and so vehement complained so much of injustice 
in being expected to go away instead of anne anne who was 
nothing to louisa while she was her sister and had the best right 
to stay in henrietta s stead why was not she to be as useful as anne 
and to go home without charles too without her husband 
no it was too unkind and in short she said more than her husband 
could long withstand and as none of the others could oppose 
when he gave way there was no help for it the change of mary for anne 
was inevitable 
anne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous 
and ill judging claims of mary but so it must be and they set off 
for the town charles taking care of his sister and captain benwick 
attending to her she gave a moment s recollection as they hurried along 
to the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed 
earlier in the morning there she had listened to henrietta s schemes 
for dr shirley s leaving uppercross farther on she had 
first seen mr elliot a moment seemed all that could now be given 
to any one but louisa or those who were wrapt up in her welfare 
captain benwick was most considerately attentive to her and 
united as they all seemed by the distress of the day she felt 
an increasing degree of good will towards him and a pleasure even 
in thinking that it might perhaps be the occasion of continuing 
their acquaintance 
captain wentworth was on the watch for them and a chaise and four in waiting 
stationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street 
but his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of one sister 
for the other the change in his countenance the astonishment 
the expressions begun and suppressed with which charles was listened to 
made but a mortifying reception of anne or must at least convince her 
that she was valued only as she could be useful to louisa 
she endeavoured to be composed and to be just without emulating 
the feelings of an emma towards her henry she would have 
attended on louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard 
for his sake and she hoped he would not long be so unjust 
as to suppose she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend 
in the mean while she was in the carriage he had handed them both in 
and placed himself between them and in this manner under these 
circumstances full of astonishment and emotion to anne she quitted lyme 
how the long stage would pass how it was to affect their manners 
what was to be their sort of intercourse she could not foresee 
it was all quite natural however he was devoted to henrietta 
always turning towards her and when he spoke at all always with the view 
of supporting her hopes and raising her spirits in general 
his voice and manner were studiously calm to spare henrietta 
from agitation seemed the governing principle once only 
when she had been grieving over the last ill judged ill fated 
walk to the cobb bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of 
he burst forth as if wholly overcome 
do not talk of it do not talk of it he cried oh god that i had 
not given way to her at the fatal moment had i done as i ought 
but so eager and so resolute dear sweet louisa 
anne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now to question the justness 
of his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage 
of firmness of character and whether it might not strike him that 
like all other qualities of the mind it should have its proportions 
and limits she thought it could scarcely escape him to feel 
that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness 
as a very resolute character 
they got on fast anne was astonished to recognise the same hills 
and the same objects so soon their actual speed heightened by 
some dread of the conclusion made the road appear but half as long 
as on the day before it was growing quite dusk however 
before they were in the neighbourhood of uppercross and there had been 
total silence among them for some time henrietta leaning back 
in the corner with a shawl over her face giving the hope of her 
having cried herself to sleep when as they were going up their last hill 
anne found herself all at once addressed by captain wentworth 
in a low cautious voice he said 
i have been considering what we had best do she must not 
appear at first she could not stand it i have been thinking whether 
you had not better remain in the carriage with her while i go in 
and break it to mr and mrs musgrove do you think this is a good plan 
she did he was satisfied and said no more but the remembrance 
of the appeal remained a pleasure to her as a proof of friendship 
and of deference for her judgement a great pleasure and when it became 
a sort of parting proof its value did not lessen 
when the distressing communication at uppercross was over 
and he had seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped 
and the daughter all the better for being with them he announced 
his intention of returning in the same carriage to lyme 
and when the horses were baited he was off 
end of volume one 
chapter 
the remainder of anne s time at uppercross comprehending only two days 
was spent entirely at the mansion house and she had the satisfaction 
of knowing herself extremely useful there both as an immediate companion 
and as assisting in all those arrangements for the future which 
in mr and mrs musgrove s distressed state of spirits would have 
been difficulties 
they had an early account from lyme the next morning louisa was 
much the same no symptoms worse than before had appeared 
charles came a few hours afterwards to bring a later and 
more particular account he was tolerably cheerful a speedy cure 
must not be hoped but everything was going on as well 
as the nature of the case admitted in speaking of the harvilles 
he seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness 
especially of mrs harville s exertions as a nurse she really left 
nothing for mary to do he and mary had been persuaded to go early 
to their inn last night mary had been hysterical again this morning 
when he came away she was going to walk out with captain benwick 
which he hoped would do her good he almost wished she had been 
prevailed on to come home the day before but the truth was 
that mrs harville left nothing for anybody to do 
charles was to return to lyme the same afternoon and his father 
had at first half a mind to go with him but the ladies could not consent 
it would be going only to multiply trouble to the others 
and increase his own distress and a much better scheme followed 
and was acted upon a chaise was sent for from crewkherne 
and charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery maid 
of the family one who having brought up all the children 
and seen the very last the lingering and long petted master harry 
sent to school after his brothers was now living in her deserted nursery 
to mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she could 
get near her and who consequently was only too happy in being 
allowed to go and help nurse dear miss louisa vague wishes of 
getting sarah thither had occurred before to mrs musgrove and henrietta 
but without anne it would hardly have been resolved on 
and found practicable so soon 
they were indebted the next day to charles hayter for all 
the minute knowledge of louisa which it was so essential to obtain 
every twenty four hours he made it his business to go to lyme 
and his account was still encouraging the intervals of sense 
and consciousness were believed to be stronger every report agreed 
in captain wentworth s appearing fixed in lyme 
anne was to leave them on the morrow an event which they all dreaded 
what should they do without her they were wretched comforters 
for one another and so much was said in this way that anne thought 
she could not do better than impart among them the general inclination 
to which she was privy and persuaded them all to go to lyme at once 
she had little difficulty it was soon determined that they would go 
go to morrow fix themselves at the inn or get into lodgings 
as it suited and there remain till dear louisa could be moved 
they must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with 
they might at least relieve mrs harville from the care of her own children 
and in short they were so happy in the decision that anne was delighted 
with what she had done and felt that she could not spend her 
last morning at uppercross better than in assisting their preparations 
and sending them off at an early hour though her being left 
to the solitary range of the house was the consequence 
she was the last excepting the little boys at the cottage 
she was the very last the only remaining one of all that had filled 
and animated both houses of all that had given uppercross 
its cheerful character a few days had made a change indeed 
if louisa recovered it would all be well again more than 
former happiness would be restored there could not be a doubt 
to her mind there was none of what would follow her recovery 
a few months hence and the room now so deserted occupied but by 
her silent pensive self might be filled again with all that was happy 
and gay all that was glowing and bright in prosperous love 
all that was most unlike anne elliot 
an hour s complete leisure for such reflections as these 
on a dark november day a small thick rain almost blotting out 
the very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows was enough 
to make the sound of lady russell s carriage exceedingly welcome 
and yet though desirous to be gone she could not quit the mansion house 
or look an adieu to the cottage with its black dripping and 
comfortless veranda or even notice through the misty glasses 
the last humble tenements of the village without a saddened heart 
scenes had passed in uppercross which made it precious 
it stood the record of many sensations of pain once severe 
but now softened and of some instances of relenting feeling 
some breathings of friendship and reconciliation which could 
never be looked for again and which could never cease to be dear 
she left it all behind her all but the recollection that 
such things had been 
anne had never entered kellynch since her quitting lady russell s house 
in september it had not been necessary and the few occasions of 
its being possible for her to go to the hall she had contrived to evade 
and escape from her first return was to resume her place in the modern 
and elegant apartments of the lodge and to gladden the eyes 
of its mistress 
there was some anxiety mixed with lady russell s joy in meeting her 
she knew who had been frequenting uppercross but happily 
either anne was improved in plumpness and looks or lady russell 
fancied her so and anne in receiving her compliments on the occasion 
had the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration 
of her cousin and of hoping that she was to be blessed with 
a second spring of youth and beauty 
when they came to converse she was soon sensible of some mental change 
the subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving kellynch 
and which she had felt slighted and been compelled to smother 
among the musgroves were now become but of secondary interest 
she had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and bath 
their concerns had been sunk under those of uppercross 
and when lady russell reverted to their former hopes and fears 
and spoke her satisfaction in the house in camden place 
which had been taken and her regret that mrs clay should still 
be with them anne would have been ashamed to have it known 
how much more she was thinking of lyme and louisa musgrove 
and all her acquaintance there how much more interesting to her 
was the home and the friendship of the harvilles and captain benwick 
than her own father s house in camden place or her own sister s intimacy 
with mrs clay she was actually forced to exert herself 
to meet lady russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude 
on topics which had by nature the first claim on her 
there was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse 
on another subject they must speak of the accident at lyme 
lady russell had not been arrived five minutes the day before 
when a full account of the whole had burst on her but still it must 
be talked of she must make enquiries she must regret the imprudence 
lament the result and captain wentworth s name must be mentioned by both 
anne was conscious of not doing it so well as lady russell 
she could not speak the name and look straight forward to 
lady russell s eye till she had adopted the expedient of telling her 
briefly what she thought of the attachment between him and louisa 
when this was told his name distressed her no longer 
lady russell had only to listen composedly and wish them happy 
but internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure in pleased contempt 
that the man who at twenty three had seemed to understand somewhat 
of the value of an anne elliot should eight years afterwards 
be charmed by a louisa musgrove 
the first three or four days passed most quietly with no circumstance 
to mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from lyme 
which found their way to anne she could not tell how and brought 
a rather improving account of louisa at the end of that period 
lady russell s politeness could repose no longer and the fainter 
self threatenings of the past became in a decided tone 
i must call on mrs croft i really must call upon her soon 
anne have you courage to go with me and pay a visit in that house 
it will be some trial to us both 
anne did not shrink from it on the contrary she truly felt as she said 
in observing 
i think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two 
your feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine 
by remaining in the neighbourhood i am become inured to it 
she could have said more on the subject for she had in fact 
so high an opinion of the crofts and considered her father 
so very fortunate in his tenants felt the parish to be so sure 
of a good example and the poor of the best attention and relief 
that however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removal 
she could not but in conscience feel that they were gone 
who deserved not to stay and that kellynch hall had passed 
into better hands than its owners these convictions must unquestionably 
have their own pain and severe was its kind but they precluded 
that pain which lady russell would suffer in entering the house again 
and returning through the well known apartments 
in such moments anne had no power of saying to herself 
these rooms ought to belong only to us oh how fallen 
in their destination how unworthily occupied an ancient family 
to be so driven away strangers filling their place 
no except when she thought of her mother and remembered where 
she had been used to sit and preside she had no sigh of that description 
to heave 
mrs croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure 
of fancying herself a favourite and on the present occasion 
receiving her in that house there was particular attention 
the sad accident at lyme was soon the prevailing topic 
and on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid it appeared 
that each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn 
that captain wentworth had been in kellynch yesterday the first time 
since the accident had brought anne the last note which she had 
not been able to trace the exact steps of had staid a few hours 
and then returned again to lyme and without any present intention 
of quitting it any more he had enquired after her she found 
particularly had expressed his hope of miss elliot s not being 
the worse for her exertions and had spoken of those exertions as great 
this was handsome and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else 
could have done 
as to the sad catastrophe itself it could be canvassed only in one style 
by a couple of steady sensible women whose judgements had to work 
on ascertained events and it was perfectly decided that it had been 
the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence 
that its effects were most alarming and that it was frightful to think 
how long miss musgrove s recovery might yet be doubtful and how liable 
she would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter 
the admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming 
ay a very bad business indeed a new sort of way this 
for a young fellow to be making love by breaking his mistress s head 
is not it miss elliot this is breaking a head and giving a plaster 
truly 
admiral croft s manners were not quite of the tone to suit lady russell 
but they delighted anne his goodness of heart and simplicity 
of character were irresistible 
now this must be very bad for you said he suddenly rousing from 
a little reverie to be coming and finding us here i had not 
recollected it before i declare but it must be very bad 
but now do not stand upon ceremony get up and go over all the rooms 
in the house if you like it 
another time sir i thank you not now 
well whenever it suits you you can slip in from the shrubbery 
at any time and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up 
by that door a good place is not it but checking himself 
you will not think it a good place for yours were always kept 
in the butler s room ay so it always is i believe 
one man s ways may be as good as another s but we all like our own best 
and so you must judge for yourself whether it would be better for you 
to go about the house or not 
anne finding she might decline it did so very gratefully 
we have made very few changes either continued the admiral 
after thinking a moment very few we told you about the laundry door 
at uppercross that has been a very great improvement 
the wonder was how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience 
of its opening as it did so long you will tell sir walter 
what we have done and that mr shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement 
the house ever had indeed i must do ourselves the justice to say 
that the few alterations we have made have been all very much 
for the better my wife should have the credit of them however 
i have done very little besides sending away some of the large 
looking glasses from my dressing room which was your father s 
a very good man and very much the gentleman i am sure 
but i should think miss elliot looking with serious reflection 
i should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life 
such a number of looking glasses oh lord there was no getting away 
from one s self so i got sophy to lend me a hand and we soon 
shifted their quarters and now i am quite snug with my 
little shaving glass in one corner and another great thing 
that i never go near 
anne amused in spite of herself was rather distressed for an answer 
and the admiral fearing he might not have been civil enough 
took up the subject again to say 
the next time you write to your good father miss elliot 
pray give him my compliments and mrs croft s and say that we are 
settled here quite to our liking and have no fault at all to find 
with the place the breakfast room chimney smokes a little 
i grant you but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard 
which may not happen three times a winter and take it altogether 
now that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge 
there is not one that we like better than this pray say so 
with my compliments he will be glad to hear it 
lady russell and mrs croft were very well pleased with each other 
but the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed 
far at present for when it was returned the crofts announced 
themselves to be going away for a few weeks to visit their connexions 
in the north of the county and probably might not be at home again 
before lady russell would be removing to bath 
so ended all danger to anne of meeting captain wentworth at kellynch hall 
or of seeing him in company with her friend everything was safe enough 
and she smiled over the many anxious feelings she had wasted 
on the subject 
chapter 
though charles and mary had remained at lyme much longer after 
mr and mrs musgrove s going than anne conceived they could have been 
at all wanted they were yet the first of the family to be at home again 
and as soon as possible after their return to uppercross 
they drove over to the lodge they had left louisa beginning to sit up 
but her head though clear was exceedingly weak and her nerves 
susceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness and though 
she might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well 
it was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear 
the removal home and her father and mother who must return 
in time to receive their younger children for the christmas holidays 
had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them 
they had been all in lodgings together mrs musgrove had 
got mrs harville s children away as much as she could every possible 
supply from uppercross had been furnished to lighten the inconvenience 
to the harvilles while the harvilles had been wanting them 
to come to dinner every day and in short it seemed to have been 
only a struggle on each side as to which should be most disinterested 
and hospitable 
mary had had her evils but upon the whole as was evident 
by her staying so long she had found more to enjoy than to suffer 
charles hayter had been at lyme oftener than suited her and when 
they dined with the harvilles there had been only a maid servant to wait 
and at first mrs harville had always given mrs musgrove precedence 
but then she had received so very handsome an apology from her 
on finding out whose daughter she was and there had been so much 
going on every day there had been so many walks between their lodgings 
and the harvilles and she had got books from the library 
and changed them so often that the balance had certainly been 
much in favour of lyme she had been taken to charmouth too 
and she had bathed and she had gone to church and there were a great many 
more people to look at in the church at lyme than at uppercross 
and all this joined to the sense of being so very useful 
had made really an agreeable fortnight 
anne enquired after captain benwick mary s face was clouded directly 
charles laughed 
oh captain benwick is very well i believe but he is 
a very odd young man i do not know what he would be at 
we asked him to come home with us for a day or two charles undertook 
to give him some shooting and he seemed quite delighted and for my part 
i thought it was all settled when behold on tuesday night 
he made a very awkward sort of excuse he never shot and he had 
been quite misunderstood and he had promised this and he had 
promised that and the end of it was i found that he did not mean to come 
i suppose he was afraid of finding it dull but upon my word 
i should have thought we were lively enough at the cottage 
for such a heart broken man as captain benwick 
charles laughed again and said now mary you know very well 
how it really was it was all your doing turning to anne 
he fancied that if he went with us he should find you close by 
he fancied everybody to be living in uppercross and when he discovered 
that lady russell lived three miles off his heart failed him 
and he had not courage to come that is the fact upon my honour 
mary knows it is 
but mary did not give into it very graciously whether from 
not considering captain benwick entitled by birth and situation 
to be in love with an elliot or from not wanting to believe 
anne a greater attraction to uppercross than herself must be 
left to be guessed anne s good will however was not to be lessened 
by what she heard she boldly acknowledged herself flattered 
and continued her enquiries 
oh he talks of you cried charles in such terms 
mary interrupted him i declare charles i never heard him 
mention anne twice all the time i was there i declare anne 
he never talks of you at all 
no admitted charles i do not know that he ever does in a general 
way but however it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly 
his head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation 
and he wants to talk to you about them he has found out something or other 
in one of them which he thinks oh i cannot pretend to remember it 
but it was something very fine i overheard him telling henrietta 
all about it and then miss elliot was spoken of in the highest terms 
now mary i declare it was so i heard it myself and you were 
in the other room elegance sweetness beauty oh there was no end 
of miss elliot s charms 
and i am sure cried mary warmly it was a very little to his credit 
if he did miss harville only died last june such a heart 
is very little worth having is it lady russell i am sure 
you will agree with me 
i must see captain benwick before i decide said lady russell smiling 
and that you are very likely to do very soon i can tell you madam 
said charles though he had not nerves for coming away with us 
and setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here 
he will make his way over to kellynch one day by himself 
you may depend on it i told him the distance and the road 
and i told him of the church s being so very well worth seeing 
for as he has a taste for those sort of things i thought that would 
be a good excuse and he listened with all his understanding and soul 
and i am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon 
so i give you notice lady russell 
any acquaintance of anne s will always be welcome to me 
was lady russell s kind answer 
oh as to being anne s acquaintance said mary i think he is rather 
my acquaintance for i have been seeing him every day this last fortnight 
well as your joint acquaintance then i shall be very happy 
to see captain benwick 
you will not find anything very agreeable in him i assure you madam 
he is one of the dullest young men that ever lived he has walked with me 
sometimes from one end of the sands to the other without saying a word 
he is not at all a well bred young man i am sure you will not like him 
there we differ mary said anne i think lady russell would like him 
i think she would be so much pleased with his mind that she would 
very soon see no deficiency in his manner 
so do i anne said charles i am sure lady russell would like him 
he is just lady russell s sort give him a book and he will 
read all day long 
yes that he will exclaimed mary tauntingly he will sit poring 
over his book and not know when a person speaks to him or when one 
drop s one s scissors or anything that happens do you think 
lady russell would like that 
lady russell could not help laughing upon my word said she 
i should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have 
admitted of such difference of conjecture steady and matter of fact 
as i may call myself i have really a curiosity to see the person 
who can give occasion to such directly opposite notions 
i wish he may be induced to call here and when he does mary 
you may depend upon hearing my opinion but i am determined 
not to judge him beforehand 
you will not like him i will answer for it 
lady russell began talking of something else mary spoke with animation 
of their meeting with or rather missing mr elliot so extraordinarily 
he is a man said lady russell whom i have no wish to see 
his declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family 
has left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me 
this decision checked mary s eagerness and stopped her short 
in the midst of the elliot countenance 
with regard to captain wentworth though anne hazarded no enquiries 
there was voluntary communication sufficient his spirits had been 
greatly recovering lately as might be expected as louisa improved 
he had improved and he was now quite a different creature 
from what he had been the first week he had not seen louisa 
and was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her 
from an interview that he did not press for it at all and 
on the contrary seemed to have a plan of going away for a week 
or ten days till her head was stronger he had talked of going 
down to plymouth for a week and wanted to persuade captain benwick 
to go with him but as charles maintained to the last captain benwick 
seemed much more disposed to ride over to kellynch 
there can be no doubt that lady russell and anne were both 
occasionally thinking of captain benwick from this time 
lady russell could not hear the door bell without feeling that it might 
be his herald nor could anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence 
in her father s grounds or any visit of charity in the village 
without wondering whether she might see him or hear of him 
captain benwick came not however he was either less disposed for it 
than charles had imagined or he was too shy and after giving him 
a week s indulgence lady russell determined him to be unworthy 
of the interest which he had been beginning to excite 
the musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school 
bringing with them mrs harville s little children to improve the noise 
of uppercross and lessen that of lyme henrietta remained with louisa 
but all the rest of the family were again in their usual quarters 
lady russell and anne paid their compliments to them once 
when anne could not but feel that uppercross was already quite alive again 
though neither henrietta nor louisa nor charles hayter 
nor captain wentworth were there the room presented as strong a contrast 
as could be wished to the last state she had seen it in 
immediately surrounding mrs musgrove were the little harvilles 
whom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children 
from the cottage expressly arrived to amuse them on one side 
was a table occupied by some chattering girls cutting up silk 
and gold paper and on the other were tressels and trays 
bending under the weight of brawn and cold pies where riotous boys 
were holding high revel the whole completed by a roaring christmas fire 
which seemed determined to be heard in spite of all the noise 
of the others charles and mary also came in of course 
during their visit and mr musgrove made a point of paying his respects 
to lady russell and sat down close to her for ten minutes 
talking with a very raised voice but from the clamour of the children 
on his knees generally in vain it was a fine family piece 
anne judging from her own temperament would have deemed 
such a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves 
which louisa s illness must have so greatly shaken but mrs musgrove 
who got anne near her on purpose to thank her most cordially 
again and again for all her attentions to them concluded 
a short recapitulation of what she had suffered herself by observing 
with a happy glance round the room that after all she had gone through 
nothing was so likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulness 
at home 
louisa was now recovering apace her mother could even think of her 
being able to join their party at home before her brothers and sisters 
went to school again the harvilles had promised to come with her 
and stay at uppercross whenever she returned captain wentworth was gone 
for the present to see his brother in shropshire 
i hope i shall remember in future said lady russell as soon as 
they were reseated in the carriage not to call at uppercross 
in the christmas holidays 
everybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters 
and sounds are quite innoxious or most distressing by their sort 
rather than their quantity when lady russell not long afterwards 
was entering bath on a wet afternoon and driving through 
the long course of streets from the old bridge to camden place 
amidst the dash of other carriages the heavy rumble of carts and drays 
the bawling of newspapermen muffin men and milkmen and the ceaseless 
clink of pattens she made no complaint no these were noises 
which belonged to the winter pleasures her spirits rose 
under their influence and like mrs musgrove she was feeling 
though not saying that after being long in the country nothing could be 
so good for her as a little quiet cheerfulness 
anne did not share these feelings she persisted in a very determined 
though very silent disinclination for bath caught the first dim view 
of the extensive buildings smoking in rain without any wish 
of seeing them better felt their progress through the streets to be 
however disagreeable yet too rapid for who would be glad to see her 
when she arrived and looked back with fond regret to the bustles 
of uppercross and the seclusion of kellynch 
elizabeth s last letter had communicated a piece of news of some interest 
mr elliot was in bath he had called in camden place had called 
a second time a third had been pointedly attentive if elizabeth 
and her father did not deceive themselves had been taking much pains 
to seek the acquaintance and proclaim the value of the connection 
as he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect this was very wonderful 
if it were true and lady russell was in a state of very agreeable 
curiosity and perplexity about mr elliot already recanting the sentiment 
she had so lately expressed to mary of his being a man whom she had 
no wish to see she had a great wish to see him if he really sought 
to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch he must be forgiven 
for having dismembered himself from the paternal tree 
anne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance 
but she felt that she would rather see mr elliot again than not 
which was more than she could say for many other persons in bath 
she was put down in camden place and lady russell then drove 
to her own lodgings in rivers street 
chapter 
sir walter had taken a very good house in camden place 
a lofty dignified situation such as becomes a man of consequence 
and both he and elizabeth were settled there much to their satisfaction 
anne entered it with a sinking heart anticipating an imprisonment 
of many months and anxiously saying to herself oh when shall i 
leave you again a degree of unexpected cordiality however 
in the welcome she received did her good her father and sister 
were glad to see her for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture 
and met her with kindness her making a fourth when they 
sat down to dinner was noticed as an advantage 
mrs clay was very pleasant and very smiling but her courtesies and smiles 
were more a matter of course anne had always felt that she would 
pretend what was proper on her arrival but the complaisance of the others 
was unlooked for they were evidently in excellent spirits 
and she was soon to listen to the causes they had no inclination 
to listen to her after laying out for some compliments of being 
deeply regretted in their old neighbourhood which anne could not pay 
they had only a few faint enquiries to make before the talk must be 
all their own uppercross excited no interest kellynch very little 
it was all bath 
they had the pleasure of assuring her that bath more than answered 
their expectations in every respect their house was undoubtedly 
the best in camden place their drawing rooms had many decided advantages 
over all the others which they had either seen or heard of 
and the superiority was not less in the style of the fitting up 
or the taste of the furniture their acquaintance was 
exceedingly sought after everybody was wanting to visit them 
they had drawn back from many introductions and still were 
perpetually having cards left by people of whom they knew nothing 
here were funds of enjoyment could anne wonder that her father 
and sister were happy she might not wonder but she must sigh 
that her father should feel no degradation in his change should see 
nothing to regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder 
should find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town 
and she must sigh and smile and wonder too as elizabeth threw open 
the folding doors and walked with exultation from one drawing room 
to the other boasting of their space at the possibility of that woman 
who had been mistress of kellynch hall finding extent to be proud of 
between two walls perhaps thirty feet asunder 
but this was not all which they had to make them happy 
they had mr elliot too anne had a great deal to hear of mr elliot 
he was not only pardoned they were delighted with him 
he had been in bath about a fortnight he had passed through bath 
in november in his way to london when the intelligence of 
sir walter s being settled there had of course reached him 
though only twenty four hours in the place but he had not been able 
to avail himself of it but he had now been a fortnight in bath 
and his first object on arriving had been to leave his card 
in camden place following it up by such assiduous endeavours to meet 
and when they did meet by such great openness of conduct 
such readiness to apologize for the past such solicitude to be received 
as a relation again that their former good understanding 
was completely re established 
they had not a fault to find in him he had explained away 
all the appearance of neglect on his own side it had originated 
in misapprehension entirely he had never had an idea of 
throwing himself off he had feared that he was thrown off 
but knew not why and delicacy had kept him silent upon the hint 
of having spoken disrespectfully or carelessly of the family 
and the family honours he was quite indignant he who had ever boasted 
of being an elliot and whose feelings as to connection 
were only too strict to suit the unfeudal tone of the present day 
he was astonished indeed but his character and general conduct 
must refute it he could refer sir walter to all who knew him 
and certainly the pains he had been taking on this the first opportunity 
of reconciliation to be restored to the footing of a relation 
and heir presumptive was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject 
the circumstances of his marriage too were found to admit of 
much extenuation this was an article not to be entered on by himself 
but a very intimate friend of his a colonel wallis a highly 
respectable man perfectly the gentleman and not an ill looking man 
sir walter added who was living in very good style in marlborough 
buildings and had at his own particular request been admitted 
to their acquaintance through mr elliot had mentioned one or two things 
relative to the marriage which made a material difference 
in the discredit of it 
colonel wallis had known mr elliot long had been well acquainted 
also with his wife had perfectly understood the whole story 
she was certainly not a woman of family but well educated 
accomplished rich and excessively in love with his friend 
there had been the charm she had sought him without that attraction 
not all her money would have tempted elliot and sir walter was 
moreover assured of her having been a very fine woman 
here was a great deal to soften the business a very fine woman 
with a large fortune in love with him sir walter seemed to admit it 
as complete apology and though elizabeth could not see the circumstance 
in quite so favourable a light she allowed it be a great extenuation 
mr elliot had called repeatedly had dined with them once 
evidently delighted by the distinction of being asked for they 
gave no dinners in general delighted in short by every proof 
of cousinly notice and placing his whole happiness in being 
on intimate terms in camden place 
anne listened but without quite understanding it allowances 
large allowances she knew must be made for the ideas of those who spoke 
she heard it all under embellishment all that sounded extravagant 
or irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin 
but in the language of the relators still however she had 
the sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared 
in mr elliot s wishing after an interval of so many years 
to be well received by them in a worldly view he had nothing to gain 
by being on terms with sir walter nothing to risk by a state of variance 
in all probability he was already the richer of the two 
and the kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title 
a sensible man and he had looked like a very sensible man 
why should it be an object to him she could only offer one solution 
it was perhaps for elizabeth s sake there might really have been 
a liking formerly though convenience and accident had drawn him 
a different way and now that he could afford to please himself 
he might mean to pay his addresses to her elizabeth was certainly 
very handsome with well bred elegant manners and her character 
might never have been penetrated by mr elliot knowing her but in public 
and when very young himself how her temper and understanding 
might bear the investigation of his present keener time of life 
was another concern and rather a fearful one most earnestly did she wish 
that he might not be too nice or too observant if elizabeth 
were his object and that elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so 
and that her friend mrs clay was encouraging the idea seemed apparent 
by a glance or two between them while mr elliot s frequent visits 
were talked of 
anne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at lyme but without 
being much attended to oh yes perhaps it had been mr elliot 
they did not know it might be him perhaps they could not listen 
to her description of him they were describing him themselves 
sir walter especially he did justice to his very gentlemanlike 
appearance his air of elegance and fashion his good shaped face 
his sensible eye but at the same time must lament his being 
very much under hung a defect which time seemed to have increased 
nor could he pretend to say that ten years had not altered 
almost every feature for the worse mr elliot appeared to think 
that he sir walter was looking exactly as he had done when 
they last parted but sir walter had not been able to return 
the compliment entirely which had embarrassed him he did not mean 
to complain however mr elliot was better to look at than most men 
and he had no objection to being seen with him anywhere 
mr elliot and his friends in marlborough buildings were talked of 
the whole evening colonel wallis had been so impatient to be 
introduced to them and mr elliot so anxious that he should 
and there was a mrs wallis at present known only to them by description 
as she was in daily expectation of her confinement but mr elliot 
spoke of her as a most charming woman quite worthy of being known 
in camden place and as soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted 
sir walter thought much of mrs wallis she was said to be 
an excessively pretty woman beautiful he longed to see her 
he hoped she might make some amends for the many very plain faces 
he was continually passing in the streets the worst of bath was 
the number of its plain women he did not mean to say that there were 
no pretty women but the number of the plain was out of all proportion 
he had frequently observed as he walked that one handsome face 
would be followed by thirty or five and thirty frights and once 
as he had stood in a shop on bond street he had counted 
eighty seven women go by one after another without there being 
a tolerable face among them it had been a frosty morning 
to be sure a sharp frost which hardly one woman in a thousand 
could stand the test of but still there certainly were 
a dreadful multitude of ugly women in bath and as for the men 
they were infinitely worse such scarecrows as the streets were full of 
it was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything 
tolerable by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced 
he had never walked anywhere arm in arm with colonel wallis 
who was a fine military figure though sandy haired without observing 
that every woman s eye was upon him every woman s eye was sure to be 
upon colonel wallis modest sir walter he was not allowed 
to escape however his daughter and mrs clay united in hinting 
that colonel wallis s companion might have as good a figure 
as colonel wallis and certainly was not sandy haired 
how is mary looking said sir walter in the height of his good humour 
the last time i saw her she had a red nose but i hope that may not 
happen every day 
oh no that must have been quite accidental in general she has been 
in very good health and very good looks since michaelmas 
if i thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds 
and grow coarse i would send her a new hat and pelisse 
anne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown 
or a cap would not be liable to any such misuse when a knock at the door 
suspended everything a knock at the door and so late 
it was ten of the clock could it be mr elliot they knew he was to dine 
in lansdown crescent it was possible that he might stop in his way home 
to ask them how they did they could think of no one else 
mrs clay decidedly thought it mr elliot s knock mrs clay was right 
with all the state which a butler and foot boy could give 
mr elliot was ushered into the room 
it was the same the very same man with no difference but of dress 
anne drew a little back while the others received his compliments 
and her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour 
but he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she 
nor her friend had taken cold the day before c c which was 
all as politely done and as politely taken as possible but her part 
must follow then sir walter talked of his youngest daughter 
mr elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter 
there was no occasion for remembering mary and anne smiling and 
blushing very becomingly shewed to mr elliot the pretty features 
which he had by no means forgotten and instantly saw with amusement 
at his little start of surprise that he had not been at all aware 
of who she was he looked completely astonished but not more astonished 
than pleased his eyes brightened and with the most perfect alacrity 
he welcomed the relationship alluded to the past and entreated 
to be received as an acquaintance already he was quite as good looking 
as he had appeared at lyme his countenance improved by speaking 
and his manners were so exactly what they ought to be so polished 
so easy so particularly agreeable that she could compare them 
in excellence to only one person s manners they were not the same 
but they were perhaps equally good 
he sat down with them and improved their conversation very much 
there could be no doubt of his being a sensible man ten minutes 
were enough to certify that his tone his expressions 
his choice of subject his knowing where to stop it was all 
the operation of a sensible discerning mind as soon as he could 
he began to talk to her of lyme wanting to compare opinions 
respecting the place but especially wanting to speak of the circumstance 
of their happening to be guests in the same inn at the same time 
to give his own route understand something of hers and regret that 
he should have lost such an opportunity of paying his respects to her 
she gave him a short account of her party and business at lyme 
his regret increased as he listened he had spent his whole 
solitary evening in the room adjoining theirs had heard voices 
mirth continually thought they must be a most delightful set of people 
longed to be with them but certainly without the smallest suspicion 
of his possessing the shadow of a right to introduce himself 
if he had but asked who the party were the name of musgrove would 
have told him enough well it would serve to cure him of 
an absurd practice of never asking a question at an inn 
which he had adopted when quite a young man on the principal 
of its being very ungenteel to be curious 
the notions of a young man of one or two and twenty said he 
as to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing 
are more absurd i believe than those of any other set of beings 
in the world the folly of the means they often employ 
is only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view 
but he must not be addressing his reflections to anne alone 
he knew it he was soon diffused again among the others 
and it was only at intervals that he could return to lyme 
his enquiries however produced at length an account of the scene 
she had been engaged in there soon after his leaving the place 
having alluded to an accident he must hear the whole 
when he questioned sir walter and elizabeth began to question also 
but the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfelt 
she could only compare mr elliot to lady russell in the wish 
of really comprehending what had passed and in the degree of concern 
for what she must have suffered in witnessing it 
he staid an hour with them the elegant little clock on the mantel 
piece had struck eleven with its silver sounds and the watchman 
was beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale 
before mr elliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there long 
anne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening in 
camden place could have passed so well 
chapter 
there was one point which anne on returning to her family 
would have been more thankful to ascertain even than mr elliot s 
being in love with elizabeth which was her father s not being 
in love with mrs clay and she was very far from easy about it 
when she had been at home a few hours on going down to breakfast 
the next morning she found there had just been a decent pretence 
on the lady s side of meaning to leave them she could imagine mrs clay 
to have said that now miss anne was come she could not suppose herself 
at all wanted for elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper 
that must not be any reason indeed i assure you i feel it none 
she is nothing to me compared with you and she was in full time 
to hear her father say my dear madam this must not be as yet 
you have seen nothing of bath you have been here only to be useful 
you must not run away from us now you must stay to be acquainted 
with mrs wallis the beautiful mrs wallis to your fine mind 
i well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification 
he spoke and looked so much in earnest that anne was not surprised 
to see mrs clay stealing a glance at elizabeth and herself 
her countenance perhaps might express some watchfulness 
but the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought 
in her sister the lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties 
and promise to stay 
in the course of the same morning anne and her father chancing to be 
alone together he began to compliment her on her improved looks 
he thought her less thin in her person in her cheeks her skin 
her complexion greatly improved clearer fresher had she been 
using any thing in particular no nothing merely gowland 
he supposed no nothing at all ha he was surprised at that 
and added certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are 
you cannot be better than well or i should recommend gowland 
the constant use of gowland during the spring months mrs clay has been 
using it at my recommendation and you see what it has done for her 
you see how it has carried away her freckles 
if elizabeth could but have heard this such personal praise 
might have struck her especially as it did not appear to anne 
that the freckles were at all lessened but everything must 
take its chance the evil of a marriage would be much diminished 
if elizabeth were also to marry as for herself she might always 
command a home with lady russell 
lady russell s composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial 
on this point in her intercourse in camden place the sight of mrs clay 
in such favour and of anne so overlooked was a perpetual provocation 
to her there and vexed her as much when she was away as a person in bath 
who drinks the water gets all the new publications and has 
a very large acquaintance has time to be vexed 
as mr elliot became known to her she grew more charitable 
or more indifferent towards the others his manners were 
an immediate recommendation and on conversing with him she found 
the solid so fully supporting the superficial that she was at first 
as she told anne almost ready to exclaim can this be mr elliot 
and could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeable 
or estimable man everything united in him good understanding 
correct opinions knowledge of the world and a warm heart 
he had strong feelings of family attachment and family honour 
without pride or weakness he lived with the liberality of a man of fortune 
without display he judged for himself in everything essential 
without defying public opinion in any point of worldly decorum 
he was steady observant moderate candid never run away with by spirits 
or by selfishness which fancied itself strong feeling and yet 
with a sensibility to what was amiable and lovely and a value 
for all the felicities of domestic life which characters of 
fancied enthusiasm and violent agitation seldom really possess 
she was sure that he had not been happy in marriage colonel wallis 
said it and lady russell saw it but it had been no unhappiness 
to sour his mind nor she began pretty soon to suspect to prevent his 
thinking of a second choice her satisfaction in mr elliot 
outweighed all the plague of mrs clay 
it was now some years since anne had begun to learn that she 
and her excellent friend could sometimes think differently 
and it did not surprise her therefore that lady russell 
should see nothing suspicious or inconsistent nothing to require 
more motives than appeared in mr elliot s great desire of a reconciliation 
in lady russell s view it was perfectly natural that mr elliot 
at a mature time of life should feel it a most desirable object 
and what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people 
to be on good terms with the head of his family the simplest process 
in the world of time upon a head naturally clear and only erring 
in the heyday of youth anne presumed however still to smile about it 
and at last to mention elizabeth lady russell listened and looked 
and made only this cautious reply elizabeth very well 
time will explain 
it was a reference to the future which anne after a little observation 
felt she must submit to she could determine nothing at present 
in that house elizabeth must be first and she was in the habit 
of such general observance as miss elliot that any particularity 
of attention seemed almost impossible mr elliot too 
it must be remembered had not been a widower seven months 
a little delay on his side might be very excusable in fact 
anne could never see the crape round his hat without fearing that 
she was the inexcusable one in attributing to him such imaginations 
for though his marriage had not been very happy still it had existed 
so many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery 
from the awful impression of its being dissolved 
however it might end he was without any question their 
pleasantest acquaintance in bath she saw nobody equal to him 
and it was a great indulgence now and then to talk to him about lyme 
which he seemed to have as lively a wish to see again and to see more of 
as herself they went through the particulars of their first meeting 
a great many times he gave her to understand that he had 
looked at her with some earnestness she knew it well 
and she remembered another person s look also 
they did not always think alike his value for rank and connexion 
she perceived was greater than hers it was not merely complaisance 
it must be a liking to the because which made him enter warmly 
into her father and sister s solicitudes on a subject which 
she thought unworthy to excite them the bath paper one morning 
announced the arrival of the dowager viscountess dalrymple 
and her daughter the honourable miss carteret and all the comfort 
of no camden place was swept away for many days for the dalrymples 
in anne s opinion most unfortunately were cousins of the elliots 
and the agony was how to introduce themselves properly 
anne had never seen her father and sister before in contact with nobility 
and she must acknowledge herself disappointed she had hoped 
better things from their high ideas of their own situation in life 
and was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen 
a wish that they had more pride for our cousins lady dalrymple 
and miss carteret our cousins the dalrymples sounded in her ears 
all day long 
sir walter had once been in company with the late viscount 
but had never seen any of the rest of the family and the difficulties 
of the case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse 
by letters of ceremony ever since the death of that said late viscount 
when in consequence of a dangerous illness of sir walter s 
at the same time there had been an unlucky omission at kellynch 
no letter of condolence had been sent to ireland the neglect 
had been visited on the head of the sinner for when poor lady elliot 
died herself no letter of condolence was received at kellynch 
and consequently there was but too much reason to apprehend 
that the dalrymples considered the relationship as closed 
how to have this anxious business set to rights and be admitted 
as cousins again was the question and it was a question which 
in a more rational manner neither lady russell nor mr elliot 
thought unimportant family connexions were always worth preserving 
good company always worth seeking lady dalrymple had taken a house 
for three months in laura place and would be living in style 
she had been at bath the year before and lady russell had heard her 
spoken of as a charming woman it was very desirable that 
the connexion should be renewed if it could be done without any 
compromise of propriety on the side of the elliots 
sir walter however would choose his own means and at last wrote 
a very fine letter of ample explanation regret and entreaty 
to his right honourable cousin neither lady russell nor mr elliot 
could admire the letter but it did all that was wanted 
in bringing three lines of scrawl from the dowager viscountess 
she was very much honoured and should be happy in their acquaintance 
the toils of the business were over the sweets began they visited 
in laura place they had the cards of dowager viscountess dalrymple 
and the honourable miss carteret to be arranged wherever they might 
be most visible and our cousins in laura place our cousin 
lady dalrymple and miss carteret were talked of to everybody 
anne was ashamed had lady dalrymple and her daughter even been 
very agreeable she would still have been ashamed of the agitation 
they created but they were nothing there was no superiority of manner 
accomplishment or understanding lady dalrymple had acquired 
the name of a charming woman because she had a smile and a civil answer 
for everybody miss carteret with still less to say was so plain 
and so awkward that she would never have been tolerated in camden place 
but for her birth 
lady russell confessed she had expected something better but yet 
it was an acquaintance worth having and when anne ventured to speak 
her opinion of them to mr elliot he agreed to their being nothing 
in themselves but still maintained that as a family connexion 
as good company as those who would collect good company around them 
they had their value anne smiled and said 
my idea of good company mr elliot is the company of clever 
well informed people who have a great deal of conversation 
that is what i call good company 
you are mistaken said he gently that is not good company 
that is the best good company requires only birth education 
and manners and with regard to education is not very nice 
birth and good manners are essential but a little learning is 
by no means a dangerous thing in good company on the contrary 
it will do very well my cousin anne shakes her head 
she is not satisfied she is fastidious my dear cousin 
sitting down by her you have a better right to be fastidious 
than almost any other woman i know but will it answer 
will it make you happy will it not be wiser to accept the society 
of those good ladies in laura place and enjoy all the advantages 
of the connexion as far as possible you may depend upon it 
that they will move in the first set in bath this winter 
and as rank is rank your being known to be related to them 
will have its use in fixing your family our family let me say 
in that degree of consideration which we must all wish for 
yes sighed anne we shall indeed be known to be related to them 
then recollecting herself and not wishing to be answered she added 
i certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken 
to procure the acquaintance i suppose smiling i have more pride 
than any of you but i confess it does vex me that we should be 
so solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged which we may 
be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them 
pardon me dear cousin you are unjust in your own claims 
in london perhaps in your present quiet style of living 
it might be as you say but in bath sir walter elliot and his family 
will always be worth knowing always acceptable as acquaintance 
well said anne i certainly am proud too proud to enjoy a welcome 
which depends so entirely upon place 
i love your indignation said he it is very natural 
but here you are in bath and the object is to be established here 
with all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to sir walter elliot 
you talk of being proud i am called proud i know and i shall not wish 
to believe myself otherwise for our pride if investigated 
would have the same object i have no doubt though the kind may seem 
a little different in one point i am sure my dear cousin 
he continued speaking lower though there was no one else in the room 
in one point i am sure we must feel alike we must feel that 
every addition to your father s society among his equals or superiors 
may be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him 
he looked as he spoke to the seat which mrs clay had been 
lately occupying a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant 
and though anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride 
she was pleased with him for not liking mrs clay and her conscience 
admitted that his wishing to promote her father s getting 
great acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her 
chapter 
while sir walter and elizabeth were assiduously pushing their 
good fortune in laura place anne was renewing an acquaintance 
of a very different description 
she had called on her former governess and had heard from her 
of there being an old school fellow in bath who had the two strong claims 
on her attention of past kindness and present suffering miss hamilton 
now mrs smith had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her life 
when it had been most valuable anne had gone unhappy to school 
grieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved 
feeling her separation from home and suffering as a girl of fourteen 
of strong sensibility and not high spirits must suffer at such a time 
and miss hamilton three years older than herself but still from the want 
of near relations and a settled home remaining another year at school 
had been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably lessened 
her misery and could never be remembered with indifference 
miss hamilton had left school had married not long afterwards 
was said to have married a man of fortune and this was all 
that anne had known of her till now that their governess s account 
brought her situation forward in a more decided but very different form 
she was a widow and poor her husband had been extravagant 
and at his death about two years before had left his affairs 
dreadfully involved she had had difficulties of every sort 
to contend with and in addition to these distresses had been afflicted 
with a severe rheumatic fever which finally settling in her legs 
had made her for the present a cripple she had come to bath 
on that account and was now in lodgings near the hot baths 
living in a very humble way unable even to afford herself 
the comfort of a servant and of course almost excluded from society 
their mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit 
from miss elliot would give mrs smith and anne therefore 
lost no time in going she mentioned nothing of what she had heard 
or what she intended at home it would excite no proper interest there 
she only consulted lady russell who entered thoroughly into her sentiments 
and was most happy to convey her as near to mrs smith s lodgings 
in westgate buildings as anne chose to be taken 
the visit was paid their acquaintance re established their interest 
in each other more than re kindled the first ten minutes 
had its awkwardness and its emotion twelve years were gone 
since they had parted and each presented a somewhat different person 
from what the other had imagined twelve years had changed anne 
from the blooming silent unformed girl of fifteen to the elegant 
little woman of seven and twenty with every beauty except bloom 
and with manners as consciously right as they were invariably gentle 
and twelve years had transformed the fine looking well grown miss hamilton 
in all the glow of health and confidence of superiority into a poor 
infirm helpless widow receiving the visit of her former protegee 
as a favour but all that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon 
passed away and left only the interesting charm of remembering 
former partialities and talking over old times 
anne found in mrs smith the good sense and agreeable manners which 
she had almost ventured to depend on and a disposition to converse 
and be cheerful beyond her expectation neither the dissipations 
of the past and she had lived very much in the world nor the restrictions 
of the present neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have 
closed her heart or ruined her spirits 
in the course of a second visit she talked with great openness 
and anne s astonishment increased she could scarcely imagine 
a more cheerless situation in itself than mrs smith s she had been 
very fond of her husband she had buried him she had been 
used to affluence it was gone she had no child to connect her 
with life and happiness again no relations to assist in the arrangement 
of perplexed affairs no health to make all the rest supportable 
her accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour and a dark bedroom 
behind with no possibility of moving from one to the other without 
assistance which there was only one servant in the house to afford 
and she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath 
yet in spite of all this anne had reason to believe that she had 
moments only of languor and depression to hours of occupation 
and enjoyment how could it be she watched observed reflected 
and finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude 
or of resignation only a submissive spirit might be patient 
a strong understanding would supply resolution but here was something more 
here was that elasticity of mind that disposition to be comforted 
that power of turning readily from evil to good and of finding employment 
which carried her out of herself which was from nature alone 
it was the choicest gift of heaven and anne viewed her friend 
as one of those instances in which by a merciful appointment 
it seems designed to counterbalance almost every other want 
there had been a time mrs smith told her when her spirits 
had nearly failed she could not call herself an invalid now 
compared with her state on first reaching bath then she had indeed 
been a pitiable object for she had caught cold on the journey 
and had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again 
confined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain 
and all this among strangers with the absolute necessity of having 
a regular nurse and finances at that moment particularly unfit 
to meet any extraordinary expense she had weathered it however 
and could truly say that it had done her good it had increased 
her comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands 
she had seen too much of the world to expect sudden or disinterested 
attachment anywhere but her illness had proved to her that her landlady 
had a character to preserve and would not use her ill and she had been 
particularly fortunate in her nurse as a sister of her landlady 
a nurse by profession and who had always a home in that house 
when unemployed chanced to be at liberty just in time to attend her 
and she said mrs smith besides nursing me most admirably 
has really proved an invaluable acquaintance as soon as i could 
use my hands she taught me to knit which has been a great amusement 
and she put me in the way of making these little thread cases 
pin cushions and card racks which you always find me so busy about 
and which supply me with the means of doing a little good 
to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood 
she had a large acquaintance of course professionally among those 
who can afford to buy and she disposes of my merchandise 
she always takes the right time for applying everybody s heart is open 
you know when they have recently escaped from severe pain 
or are recovering the blessing of health and nurse rooke 
thoroughly understands when to speak she is a shrewd intelligent 
sensible woman hers is a line for seeing human nature and she has 
a fund of good sense and observation which as a companion make her 
infinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received 
the best education in the world know nothing worth attending to 
call it gossip if you will but when nurse rooke has half an hour s 
leisure to bestow on me she is sure to have something to relate 
that is entertaining and profitable something that makes one 
know one s species better one likes to hear what is going on 
to be au fait as to the newest modes of being trifling and silly 
to me who live so much alone her conversation i assure you is a treat 
anne far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure replied 
i can easily believe it women of that class have great opportunities 
and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to 
such varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing 
and it is not merely in its follies that they are well read 
for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be 
most interesting or affecting what instances must pass before them 
of ardent disinterested self denying attachment of heroism fortitude 
patience resignation of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices 
that ennoble us most a sick chamber may often furnish 
the worth of volumes 
yes said mrs smith more doubtingly sometimes it may 
though i fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe 
here and there human nature may be great in times of trial 
but generally speaking it is its weakness and not its strength 
that appears in a sick chamber it is selfishness and impatience 
rather than generosity and fortitude that one hears of 
there is so little real friendship in the world and unfortunately 
speaking low and tremulously there are so many who forget 
to think seriously till it is almost too late 
anne saw the misery of such feelings the husband had not been 
what he ought and the wife had been led among that part of mankind 
which made her think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved 
it was but a passing emotion however with mrs smith she shook it off 
and soon added in a different tone 
i do not suppose the situation my friend mrs rooke is in at present 
will furnish much either to interest or edify me she is only nursing 
mrs wallis of marlborough buildings a mere pretty silly expensive 
fashionable woman i believe and of course will have nothing to report 
but of lace and finery i mean to make my profit of mrs wallis however 
she has plenty of money and i intend she shall buy all 
the high priced things i have in hand now 
anne had called several times on her friend before the existence 
of such a person was known in camden place at last it became necessary 
to speak of her sir walter elizabeth and mrs clay returned one morning 
from laura place with a sudden invitation from lady dalrymple 
for the same evening and anne was already engaged to spend that evening 
in westgate buildings she was not sorry for the excuse 
they were only asked she was sure because lady dalrymple being 
kept at home by a bad cold was glad to make use of the relationship 
which had been so pressed on her and she declined on her own account 
with great alacrity she was engaged to spend the evening 
with an old schoolfellow they were not much interested in anything 
relative to anne but still there were questions enough asked 
to make it understood what this old schoolfellow was and elizabeth 
was disdainful and sir walter severe 
westgate buildings said he and who is miss anne elliot 
to be visiting in westgate buildings a mrs smith a widow mrs smith 
and who was her husband one of five thousand mr smiths whose names 
are to be met with everywhere and what is her attraction 
that she is old and sickly upon my word miss anne elliot 
you have the most extraordinary taste everything that revolts 
other people low company paltry rooms foul air disgusting associations 
are inviting to you but surely you may put off this old lady 
till to morrow she is not so near her end i presume 
but that she may hope to see another day what is her age forty 
no sir she is not one and thirty but i do not think i can 
put off my engagement because it is the only evening for some time 
which will at once suit her and myself she goes into the warm bath 
to morrow and for the rest of the week you know we are engaged 
but what does lady russell think of this acquaintance asked elizabeth 
she sees nothing to blame in it replied anne on the contrary 
she approves it and has generally taken me when i have 
called on mrs smith 
westgate buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance 
of a carriage drawn up near its pavement observed sir walter 
sir henry russell s widow indeed has no honours to distinguish her arms 
but still it is a handsome equipage and no doubt is well known 
to convey a miss elliot a widow mrs smith lodging in westgate buildings 
a poor widow barely able to live between thirty and forty 
a mere mrs smith an every day mrs smith of all people and all names 
in the world to be the chosen friend of miss anne elliot 
and to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility 
of england and ireland mrs smith such a name 
mrs clay who had been present while all this passed now thought it 
advisable to leave the room and anne could have said much 
and did long to say a little in defence of her friend s 
not very dissimilar claims to theirs but her sense of personal respect 
to her father prevented her she made no reply she left it 
to himself to recollect that mrs smith was not the only widow 
in bath between thirty and forty with little to live on 
and no surname of dignity 
anne kept her appointment the others kept theirs and of course 
she heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening 
she had been the only one of the set absent for sir walter 
and elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship s service themselves 
but had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others 
and had been at the trouble of inviting both lady russell and mr elliot 
and mr elliot had made a point of leaving colonel wallis early 
and lady russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements 
in order to wait on her anne had the whole history of all that 
such an evening could supply from lady russell to her 
its greatest interest must be in having been very much talked of 
between her friend and mr elliot in having been wished for regretted 
and at the same time honoured for staying away in such a because 
her kind compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow 
sick and reduced seemed to have quite delighted mr elliot 
he thought her a most extraordinary young woman in her temper manners 
mind a model of female excellence he could meet even lady russell 
in a discussion of her merits and anne could not be given to understand 
so much by her friend could not know herself to be so highly rated 
by a sensible man without many of those agreeable sensations 
which her friend meant to create 
lady russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of mr elliot 
she was as much convinced of his meaning to gain anne in time as of 
his deserving her and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks 
which would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood 
and leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing 
she would not speak to anne with half the certainty she felt on the subject 
she would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter 
of a possible attachment on his side of the desirableness of the alliance 
supposing such attachment to be real and returned anne heard her 
and made no violent exclamations she only smiled blushed 
and gently shook her head 
i am no match maker as you well know said lady russell 
being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events 
and calculations i only mean that if mr elliot should some time hence 
pay his addresses to you and if you should be disposed to accept him 
i think there would be every possibility of your being happy together 
a most suitable connection everybody must consider it but i think 
it might be a very happy one 
mr elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man and in many respects 
i think highly of him said anne but we should not suit 
lady russell let this pass and only said in rejoinder i own that 
to be able to regard you as the future mistress of kellynch 
the future lady elliot to look forward and see you occupying 
your dear mother s place succeeding to all her rights 
and all her popularity as well as to all her virtues would be 
the highest possible gratification to me you are your mother s self 
in countenance and disposition and if i might be allowed to fancy you 
such as she was in situation and name and home presiding and blessing 
in the same spot and only superior to her in being more highly valued 
my dearest anne it would give me more delight than is often felt 
at my time of life 
anne was obliged to turn away to rise to walk to a distant table 
and leaning there in pretended employment try to subdue the feelings 
this picture excited for a few moments her imagination and her heart 
were bewitched the idea of becoming what her mother had been 
of having the precious name of lady elliot first revived in herself 
of being restored to kellynch calling it her home again 
her home for ever was a charm which she could not immediately resist 
lady russell said not another word willing to leave the matter 
to its own operation and believing that could mr elliot at that moment 
with propriety have spoken for himself she believed in short 
what anne did not believe the same image of mr elliot speaking 
for himself brought anne to composure again the charm of kellynch 
and of lady elliot all faded away she never could accept him 
and it was not only that her feelings were still adverse to any man 
save one her judgement on a serious consideration of the possibilities 
of such a case was against mr elliot 
though they had now been acquainted a month she could not be satisfied 
that she really knew his character that he was a sensible man 
an agreeable man that he talked well professed good opinions 
seemed to judge properly and as a man of principle this was all 
clear enough he certainly knew what was right nor could she fix 
on any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed but yet she would 
have been afraid to answer for his conduct she distrusted the past 
if not the present the names which occasionally dropt 
of former associates the allusions to former practices and pursuits 
suggested suspicions not favourable of what he had been 
she saw that there had been bad habits that sunday travelling 
had been a common thing that there had been a period of his life 
and probably not a short one when he had been at least 
careless in all serious matters and though he might now think 
very differently who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever 
cautious man grown old enough to appreciate a fair character 
how could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed 
mr elliot was rational discreet polished but he was not open 
there was never any burst of feeling any warmth of indignation or delight 
at the evil or good of others this to anne was a decided imperfection 
her early impressions were incurable she prized the frank 
the open hearted the eager character beyond all others 
warmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still she felt that she could 
so much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked 
or said a careless or a hasty thing than of those whose presence of mind 
never varied whose tongue never slipped 
mr elliot was too generally agreeable various as were the tempers 
in her father s house he pleased them all he endured too well 
stood too well with every body he had spoken to her with some 
degree of openness of mrs clay had appeared completely to see 
what mrs clay was about and to hold her in contempt and yet 
mrs clay found him as agreeable as any body 
lady russell saw either less or more than her young friend 
for she saw nothing to excite distrust she could not imagine 
a man more exactly what he ought to be than mr elliot nor did she 
ever enjoy a sweeter feeling than the hope of seeing him receive 
the hand of her beloved anne in kellynch church in the course of 
the following autumn 
chapter 
it was the beginning of february and anne having been a month in bath 
was growing very eager for news from uppercross and lyme 
she wanted to hear much more than mary had communicated 
it was three weeks since she had heard at all she only knew 
that henrietta was at home again and that louisa though considered to be 
recovering fast was still in lyme and she was thinking of them all 
very intently one evening when a thicker letter than usual from mary 
was delivered to her and to quicken the pleasure and surprise 
with admiral and mrs croft s compliments 
the crofts must be in bath a circumstance to interest her 
they were people whom her heart turned to very naturally 
what is this cried sir walter the crofts have arrived in bath 
the crofts who rent kellynch what have they brought you 
a letter from uppercross cottage sir 
oh those letters are convenient passports they secure an introduction 
i should have visited admiral croft however at any rate 
i know what is due to my tenant 
anne could listen no longer she could not even have told how 
the poor admiral s complexion escaped her letter engrossed her 
it had been begun several days back 
february st 
my dear anne i make no apology for my silence because i know 
how little people think of letters in such a place as bath 
you must be a great deal too happy to care for uppercross which 
as you well know affords little to write about we have had 
a very dull christmas mr and mrs musgrove have not had one dinner party 
all the holidays i do not reckon the hayters as anybody 
the holidays however are over at last i believe no children ever had 
such long ones i am sure i had not the house was cleared yesterday 
except of the little harvilles but you will be surprised to hear 
they have never gone home mrs harville must be an odd mother 
to part with them so long i do not understand it they are 
not at all nice children in my opinion but mrs musgrove seems to 
like them quite as well if not better than her grandchildren 
what dreadful weather we have had it may not be felt in bath 
with your nice pavements but in the country it is of some consequence 
i have not had a creature call on me since the second week in january 
except charles hayter who had been calling much oftener than was welcome 
between ourselves i think it a great pity henrietta did not remain at lyme 
as long as louisa it would have kept her a little out of his way 
the carriage is gone to day to bring louisa and the harvilles to morrow 
we are not asked to dine with them however till the day after 
mrs musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey 
which is not very likely considering the care that will be taken of her 
and it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to morrow 
i am glad you find mr elliot so agreeable and wish i could be acquainted 
with him too but i have my usual luck i am always out of the way 
when any thing desirable is going on always the last of my family 
to be noticed what an immense time mrs clay has been staying 
with elizabeth does she never mean to go away but perhaps 
if she were to leave the room vacant we might not be invited 
let me know what you think of this i do not expect my children 
to be asked you know i can leave them at the great house very well 
for a month or six weeks i have this moment heard that the crofts 
are going to bath almost immediately they think the admiral gouty 
charles heard it quite by chance they have not had the civility 
to give me any notice or of offering to take anything 
i do not think they improve at all as neighbours we see nothing of them 
and this is really an instance of gross inattention charles joins me 
in love and everything proper yours affectionately 
mary m 
i am sorry to say that i am very far from well and jemima has 
just told me that the butcher says there is a bad sore throat 
very much about i dare say i shall catch it and my sore throats 
you know are always worse than anybody s 
so ended the first part which had been afterwards put into an envelope 
containing nearly as much more 
i kept my letter open that i might send you word how louisa 
bore her journey and now i am extremely glad i did having a great deal 
to add in the first place i had a note from mrs croft yesterday 
offering to convey anything to you a very kind friendly note indeed 
addressed to me just as it ought i shall therefore be able to 
make my letter as long as i like the admiral does not seem very ill 
and i sincerely hope bath will do him all the good he wants 
i shall be truly glad to have them back again our neighbourhood 
cannot spare such a pleasant family but now for louisa 
i have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little 
she and the harvilles came on tuesday very safely and in the evening 
we went to ask her how she did when we were rather surprised 
not to find captain benwick of the party for he had been invited 
as well as the harvilles and what do you think was the reason 
neither more nor less than his being in love with louisa 
and not choosing to venture to uppercross till he had had an answer 
from mr musgrove for it was all settled between him and her 
before she came away and he had written to her father by captain harville 
true upon my honour are not you astonished i shall be surprised 
at least if you ever received a hint of it for i never did 
mrs musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter 
we are all very well pleased however for though it is not equal to her 
marrying captain wentworth it is infinitely better than charles hayter 
and mr musgrove has written his consent and captain benwick 
is expected to day mrs harville says her husband feels a good deal 
on his poor sister s account but however louisa is a great favourite 
with both indeed mrs harville and i quite agree that we love her 
the better for having nursed her charles wonders what captain wentworth 
will say but if you remember i never thought him attached to louisa 
i never could see anything of it and this is the end you see 
of captain benwick s being supposed to be an admirer of yours 
how charles could take such a thing into his head was always 
incomprehensible to me i hope he will be more agreeable now 
certainly not a great match for louisa musgrove but a million times better 
than marrying among the hayters 
mary need not have feared her sister s being in any degree prepared 
for the news she had never in her life been more astonished 
captain benwick and louisa musgrove it was almost too wonderful 
for belief and it was with the greatest effort that she could remain 
in the room preserve an air of calmness and answer the common questions 
of the moment happily for her they were not many sir walter 
wanted to know whether the crofts travelled with four horses 
and whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of bath 
as it might suit miss elliot and himself to visit in but had 
little curiosity beyond 
how is mary said elizabeth and without waiting for an answer 
and pray what brings the crofts to bath 
they come on the admiral s account he is thought to be gouty 
gout and decrepitude said sir walter poor old gentleman 
have they any acquaintance here asked elizabeth 
i do not know but i can hardly suppose that at admiral croft s 
time of life and in his profession he should not have many acquaintance 
in such a place as this 
i suspect said sir walter coolly that admiral croft 
will be best known in bath as the renter of kellynch hall 
elizabeth may we venture to present him and his wife in laura place 
oh no i think not situated as we are with lady dalrymple cousins 
we ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance 
she might not approve if we were not related it would not signify 
but as cousins she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours 
we had better leave the crofts to find their own level 
there are several odd looking men walking about here who 
i am told are sailors the crofts will associate with them 
this was sir walter and elizabeth s share of interest in the letter 
when mrs clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention 
in an enquiry after mrs charles musgrove and her fine little boys 
anne was at liberty 
in her own room she tried to comprehend it well might charles wonder 
how captain wentworth would feel perhaps he had quitted the field 
had given louisa up had ceased to love had found he did not love her 
she could not endure the idea of treachery or levity or anything 
akin to ill usage between him and his friend she could not endure 
that such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly 
captain benwick and louisa musgrove the high spirited 
joyous talking louisa musgrove and the dejected thinking 
feeling reading captain benwick seemed each of them everything 
that would not suit the other their minds most dissimilar 
where could have been the attraction the answer soon presented itself 
it had been in situation they had been thrown together several weeks 
they had been living in the same small family party since henrietta s 
coming away they must have been depending almost entirely on each other 
and louisa just recovering from illness had been in an interesting state 
and captain benwick was not inconsolable that was a point which anne 
had not been able to avoid suspecting before and instead of drawing 
the same conclusion as mary from the present course of events 
they served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some 
dawning of tenderness toward herself she did not mean however 
to derive much more from it to gratify her vanity than mary 
might have allowed she was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing 
young woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have 
received the same compliment he had an affectionate heart 
he must love somebody 
she saw no reason against their being happy louisa had fine 
naval fervour to begin with and they would soon grow more alike 
he would gain cheerfulness and she would learn to be an enthusiast 
for scott and lord byron nay that was probably learnt already 
of course they had fallen in love over poetry the idea of 
louisa musgrove turned into a person of literary taste 
and sentimental reflection was amusing but she had no doubt 
of its being so the day at lyme the fall from the cobb 
might influence her health her nerves her courage her character to 
the end of her life as thoroughly as it appeared to have 
influenced her fate 
the conclusion of the whole was that if the woman who had been sensible 
of captain wentworth s merits could be allowed to prefer another man 
there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder 
and if captain wentworth lost no friend by it certainly nothing 
to be regretted no it was not regret which made anne s heart 
beat in spite of herself and brought the colour into her cheeks 
when she thought of captain wentworth unshackled and free 
she had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate 
they were too much like joy senseless joy 
she longed to see the crofts but when the meeting took place 
it was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them 
the visit of ceremony was paid and returned and louisa musgrove 
was mentioned and captain benwick too without even half a smile 
the crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in gay street 
perfectly to sir walter s satisfaction he was not at all ashamed 
of the acquaintance and did in fact think and talk a great deal more 
about the admiral than the admiral ever thought or talked about him 
the crofts knew quite as many people in bath as they wished for 
and considered their intercourse with the elliots as a mere matter of form 
and not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure 
they brought with them their country habit of being almost always together 
he was ordered to walk to keep off the gout and mrs croft 
seemed to go shares with him in everything and to walk 
for her life to do him good anne saw them wherever she went 
lady russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning 
and she never failed to think of them and never failed to see them 
knowing their feelings as she did it was a most attractive picture 
of happiness to her she always watched them as long as she could 
delighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of 
as they walked along in happy independence or equally delighted 
to see the admiral s hearty shake of the hand when he encountered 
an old friend and observe their eagerness of conversation 
when occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy mrs croft 
looking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her 
anne was too much engaged with lady russell to be often walking herself 
but it so happened that one morning about a week or ten days 
after the croft s arrival it suited her best to leave her friend 
or her friend s carriage in the lower part of the town 
and return alone to camden place and in walking up milsom street 
she had the good fortune to meet with the admiral he was standing 
by himself at a printshop window with his hands behind him 
in earnest contemplation of some print and she not only might have 
passed him unseen but was obliged to touch as well as address him 
before she could catch his notice when he did perceive and 
acknowledge her however it was done with all his usual frankness 
and good humour ha is it you thank you thank you 
this is treating me like a friend here i am you see 
staring at a picture i can never get by this shop without stopping 
but what a thing here is by way of a boat do look at it 
did you ever see the like what queer fellows your fine painters must be 
to think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless 
old cockleshell as that and yet here are two gentlemen 
stuck up in it mightily at their ease and looking about them at the rocks 
and mountains as if they were not to be upset the next moment 
which they certainly must be i wonder where that boat was built 
laughing heartily i would not venture over a horsepond in it 
well turning away now where are you bound can i go anywhere 
for you or with you can i be of any use 
none i thank you unless you will give me the pleasure of your company 
the little way our road lies together i am going home 
that i will with all my heart and farther too yes yes 
we will have a snug walk together and i have something to tell you 
as we go along there take my arm that is right i do not 
feel comfortable if i have not a woman there lord what a boat it is 
taking a last look at the picture as they began to be in motion 
did you say that you had something to tell me sir 
yes i have presently but here comes a friend captain brigden 
i shall only say how d ye do as we pass however i shall not stop 
how d ye do brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife 
she poor soul is tied by the leg she has a blister on one of her heels 
as large as a three shilling piece if you look across the street 
you will see admiral brand coming down and his brother shabby fellows 
both of them i am glad they are not on this side of the way 
sophy cannot bear them they played me a pitiful trick once 
got away with some of my best men i will tell you the whole story 
another time there comes old sir archibald drew and his grandson 
look he sees us he kisses his hand to you he takes you for my wife 
ah the peace has come too soon for that younker poor old sir archibald 
how do you like bath miss elliot it suits us very well 
we are always meeting with some old friend or other the streets 
full of them every morning sure to have plenty of chat 
and then we get away from them all and shut ourselves in our lodgings 
and draw in our chairs and are snug as if we were at kellynch 
ay or as we used to be even at north yarmouth and deal 
we do not like our lodgings here the worse i can tell you 
for putting us in mind of those we first had at north yarmouth 
the wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way 
when they were got a little farther anne ventured to press again 
for what he had to communicate she hoped when clear of milsom street 
to have her curiosity gratified but she was still obliged to wait 
for the admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had 
gained the greater space and quiet of belmont and as she was 
not really mrs croft she must let him have his own way 
as soon as they were fairly ascending belmont he began 
well now you shall hear something that will surprise you 
but first of all you must tell me the name of the young lady 
i am going to talk about that young lady you know that we have 
all been so concerned for the miss musgrove that all this has been 
happening to her christian name i always forget her christian name 
anne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really 
did but now she could safely suggest the name of louisa 
ay ay miss louisa musgrove that is the name i wish young ladies 
had not such a number of fine christian names i should never be out 
if they were all sophys or something of that sort well 
this miss louisa we all thought you know was to marry frederick 
he was courting her week after week the only wonder was 
what they could be waiting for till the business at lyme came 
then indeed it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain 
was set to right but even then there was something odd in their 
way of going on instead of staying at lyme he went off to plymouth 
and then he went off to see edward when we came back from minehead 
he was gone down to edward s and there he has been ever since 
we have seen nothing of him since november even sophy could 
not understand it but now the matter has take the strangest turn of all 
for this young lady the same miss musgrove instead of being 
to marry frederick is to marry james benwick you know james benwick 
a little i am a little acquainted with captain benwick 
well she is to marry him nay most likely they are married already 
for i do not know what they should wait for 
i thought captain benwick a very pleasing young man said anne 
and i understand that he bears an excellent character 
oh yes yes there is not a word to be said against james benwick 
he is only a commander it is true made last summer and these are 
bad times for getting on but he has not another fault that i know of 
an excellent good hearted fellow i assure you a very active 
zealous officer too which is more than you would think for perhaps 
for that soft sort of manner does not do him justice 
indeed you are mistaken there sir i should never augur want of spirit 
from captain benwick s manners i thought them particularly pleasing 
and i will answer for it they would generally please 
well well ladies are the best judges but james benwick is rather too 
piano for me and though very likely it is all our partiality 
sophy and i cannot help thinking frederick s manners better than his 
there is something about frederick more to our taste 
anne was caught she had only meant to oppose the too common idea 
of spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other 
not at all to represent captain benwick s manners as the very best 
that could possibly be and after a little hesitation 
she was beginning to say i was not entering into any comparison 
of the two friends but the admiral interrupted her with 
and the thing is certainly true it is not a mere bit of gossip 
we have it from frederick himself his sister had a letter 
from him yesterday in which he tells us of it and he had just had it 
in a letter from harville written upon the spot from uppercross 
i fancy they are all at uppercross 
this was an opportunity which anne could not resist she said therefore 
i hope admiral i hope there is nothing in the style of captain 
wentworth s letter to make you and mrs croft particularly uneasy 
it did seem last autumn as if there were an attachment between him 
and louisa musgrove but i hope it may be understood to have worn out 
on each side equally and without violence i hope his letter 
does not breathe the spirit of an ill used man 
not at all not at all there is not an oath or a murmur 
from beginning to end 
anne looked down to hide her smile 
no no frederick is not a man to whine and complain he has 
too much spirit for that if the girl likes another man better 
it is very fit she should have him 
certainly but what i mean is that i hope there is nothing 
in captain wentworth s manner of writing to make you suppose 
he thinks himself ill used by his friend which might appear 
you know without its being absolutely said i should be very sorry 
that such a friendship as has subsisted between him and captain benwick 
should be destroyed or even wounded by a circumstance of this sort 
yes yes i understand you but there is nothing at all of that nature 
in the letter he does not give the least fling at benwick 
does not so much as say i wonder at it i have a reason of my own 
for wondering at it no you would not guess from his way of writing 
that he had ever thought of this miss what is her name for himself 
he very handsomely hopes they will be happy together and there is 
nothing very unforgiving in that i think 
anne did not receive the perfect conviction which the admiral meant 
to convey but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther 
she therefore satisfied herself with common place remarks or quiet 
attention and the admiral had it all his own way 
poor frederick said he at last now he must begin all over again 
with somebody else i think we must get him to bath sophy must write 
and beg him to come to bath here are pretty girls enough i am sure 
it would be of no use to go to uppercross again for that other 
miss musgrove i find is bespoke by her cousin the young parson 
do not you think miss elliot we had better try to get him to bath 
chapter 
while admiral croft was taking this walk with anne and expressing 
his wish of getting captain wentworth to bath captain wentworth 
was already on his way thither before mrs croft had written 
he was arrived and the very next time anne walked out she saw him 
mr elliot was attending his two cousins and mrs clay they were 
in milsom street it began to rain not much but enough to 
make shelter desirable for women and quite enough to make it 
very desirable for miss elliot to have the advantage of being 
conveyed home in lady dalrymple s carriage which was seen waiting 
at a little distance she anne and mrs clay therefore 
turned into molland s while mr elliot stepped to lady dalrymple 
to request her assistance he soon joined them again successful 
of course lady dalrymple would be most happy to take them home 
and would call for them in a few minutes 
her ladyship s carriage was a barouche and did not hold 
more than four with any comfort miss carteret was with her mother 
consequently it was not reasonable to expect accommodation 
for all the three camden place ladies there could be no doubt 
as to miss elliot whoever suffered inconvenience she must suffer none 
but it occupied a little time to settle the point of civility 
between the other two the rain was a mere trifle and anne was 
most sincere in preferring a walk with mr elliot but the rain was also 
a mere trifle to mrs clay she would hardly allow it even to drop at all 
and her boots were so thick much thicker than miss anne s 
and in short her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left 
to walk with mr elliot as anne could be and it was discussed between them 
with a generosity so polite and so determined that the others were 
obliged to settle it for them miss elliot maintaining that mrs clay 
had a little cold already and mr elliot deciding on appeal 
that his cousin anne s boots were rather the thickest 
it was fixed accordingly that mrs clay should be of the party 
in the carriage and they had just reached this point when anne 
as she sat near the window descried most decidedly and distinctly 
captain wentworth walking down the street 
her start was perceptible only to herself but she instantly felt that 
she was the greatest simpleton in the world the most unaccountable 
and absurd for a few minutes she saw nothing before her 
it was all confusion she was lost and when she had scolded 
back her senses she found the others still waiting for the carriage 
and mr elliot always obliging just setting off for union street 
on a commission of mrs clay s 
she now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door 
she wanted to see if it rained why was she to suspect herself 
of another motive captain wentworth must be out of sight 
she left her seat she would go one half of her should not be always 
so much wiser than the other half or always suspecting the other 
of being worse than it was she would see if it rained 
she was sent back however in a moment by the entrance of 
captain wentworth himself among a party of gentlemen and ladies 
evidently his acquaintance and whom he must have joined 
a little below milsom street he was more obviously struck 
and confused by the sight of her than she had ever observed before 
he looked quite red for the first time since their renewed acquaintance 
she felt that she was betraying the least sensibility of the two 
she had the advantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments 
all the overpowering blinding bewildering first effects 
of strong surprise were over with her still however 
she had enough to feel it was agitation pain pleasure 
a something between delight and misery 
he spoke to her and then turned away the character of his manner 
was embarrassment she could not have called it either cold or friendly 
or anything so certainly as embarrassed 
after a short interval however he came towards her and spoke again 
mutual enquiries on common subjects passed neither of them probably 
much the wiser for what they heard and anne continuing fully sensible 
of his being less at ease than formerly they had by dint of being 
so very much together got to speak to each other with a considerable 
portion of apparent indifference and calmness but he could not do it now 
time had changed him or louisa had changed him there was consciousness 
of some sort or other he looked very well not as if he had been 
suffering in health or spirits and he talked of uppercross 
of the musgroves nay even of louisa and had even a momentary look 
of his own arch significance as he named her but yet it was 
captain wentworth not comfortable not easy not able to feign that he was 
it did not surprise but it grieved anne to observe that elizabeth 
would not know him she saw that he saw elizabeth that elizabeth saw him 
that there was complete internal recognition on each side 
she was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance 
expecting it and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away 
with unalterable coldness 
lady dalrymple s carriage for which miss elliot was growing 
very impatient now drew up the servant came in to announce it 
it was beginning to rain again and altogether there was a delay 
and a bustle and a talking which must make all the little crowd 
in the shop understand that lady dalrymple was calling to convey 
miss elliot at last miss elliot and her friend unattended but 
by the servant for there was no cousin returned were walking off 
and captain wentworth watching them turned again to anne 
and by manner rather than words was offering his services to her 
i am much obliged to you was her answer but i am not going with them 
the carriage would not accommodate so many i walk i prefer walking 
but it rains 
oh very little nothing that i regard 
after a moment s pause he said though i came only yesterday 
i have equipped myself properly for bath already you see 
pointing to a new umbrella i wish you would make use of it 
if you are determined to walk though i think it would be more prudent 
to let me get you a chair 
she was very much obliged to him but declined it all repeating 
her conviction that the rain would come to nothing at present 
and adding i am only waiting for mr elliot he will be here in a moment 
i am sure 
she had hardly spoken the words when mr elliot walked in 
captain wentworth recollected him perfectly there was no difference 
between him and the man who had stood on the steps at lyme 
admiring anne as she passed except in the air and look and manner 
of the privileged relation and friend he came in with eagerness 
appeared to see and think only of her apologised for his stay 
was grieved to have kept her waiting and anxious to get her away 
without further loss of time and before the rain increased 
and in another moment they walked off together her arm under his 
a gentle and embarrassed glance and a good morning to you 
being all that she had time for as she passed away 
as soon as they were out of sight the ladies of captain wentworth s party 
began talking of them 
mr elliot does not dislike his cousin i fancy 
oh no that is clear enough one can guess what will happen there 
he is always with them half lives in the family i believe 
what a very good looking man 
yes and miss atkinson who dined with him once at the wallises 
says he is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with 
she is pretty i think anne elliot very pretty when one comes 
to look at her it is not the fashion to say so but i confess 
i admire her more than her sister 
oh so do i 
and so do i no comparison but the men are all wild after miss elliot 
anne is too delicate for them 
anne would have been particularly obliged to her cousin if he would have 
walked by her side all the way to camden place without saying a word 
she had never found it so difficult to listen to him though nothing 
could exceed his solicitude and care and though his subjects 
were principally such as were will not to be always interesting 
praise warm just and discriminating of lady russell 
and insinuations highly rational against mrs clay but just now 
she could think only of captain wentworth she could not understand 
his present feelings whether he were really suffering much 
from disappointment or not and till that point were settled 
she could not be quite herself 
she hoped to be wise and reasonable in time but alas alas 
she must confess to herself that she was not wise yet 
another circumstance very essential for her to know was how long 
he meant to be in bath he had not mentioned it or she could not 
recollect it he might be only passing through but it was more probable 
that he should be come to stay in that case so liable as every body was 
to meet every body in bath lady russell would in all likelihood 
see him somewhere would she recollect him how would it all be 
she had already been obliged to tell lady russell that louisa musgrove 
was to marry captain benwick it had cost her something to encounter 
lady russell s surprise and now if she were by any chance 
to be thrown into company with captain wentworth her imperfect knowledge 
of the matter might add another shade of prejudice against him 
the following morning anne was out with her friend and for the first hour 
in an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain but at last 
in returning down pulteney street she distinguished him 
on the right hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in view 
the greater part of the street there were many other men about him 
many groups walking the same way but there was no mistaking him 
she looked instinctively at lady russell but not from any mad idea 
of her recognising him so soon as she did herself no it was 
not to be supposed that lady russell would perceive him till they 
were nearly opposite she looked at her however from time to time 
anxiously and when the moment approached which must point him out 
though not daring to look again for her own countenance she knew 
was unfit to be seen she was yet perfectly conscious of 
lady russell s eyes being turned exactly in the direction for him 
of her being in short intently observing him she could thoroughly 
comprehend the sort of fascination he must possess over lady russell s mind 
the difficulty it must be for her to withdraw her eyes the astonishment 
she must be feeling that eight or nine years should have passed over him 
and in foreign climes and in active service too without robbing him 
of one personal grace 
at last lady russell drew back her head now how would she 
speak of him 
you will wonder said she what has been fixing my eye so long 
but i was looking after some window curtains which lady alicia and 
mrs frankland were telling me of last night they described 
the drawing room window curtains of one of the houses on this 
side of the way and this part of the street as being the handsomest 
and best hung of any in bath but could not recollect the exact number 
and i have been trying to find out which it could be but i confess 
i can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description 
anne sighed and blushed and smiled in pity and disdain 
either at her friend or herself the part which provoked her most 
was that in all this waste of foresight and caution she should have 
lost the right moment for seeing whether he saw them 
a day or two passed without producing anything the theatre or the rooms 
where he was most likely to be were not fashionable enough 
for the elliots whose evening amusements were solely in the 
elegant stupidity of private parties in which they were getting 
more and more engaged and anne wearied of such a state of stagnation 
sick of knowing nothing and fancying herself stronger because 
her strength was not tried was quite impatient for the concert evening 
it was a concert for the benefit of a person patronised by lady dalrymple 
of course they must attend it was really expected to be a good one 
and captain wentworth was very fond of music if she could only have 
a few minutes conversation with him again she fancied she should 
be satisfied and as to the power of addressing him she felt all over 
courage if the opportunity occurred elizabeth had turned from him 
lady russell overlooked him her nerves were strengthened 
by these circumstances she felt that she owed him attention 
she had once partly promised mrs smith to spend the evening with her 
but in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off 
with the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow 
mrs smith gave a most good humoured acquiescence 
by all means said she only tell me all about it when you do come 
who is your party 
anne named them all mrs smith made no reply but when she was 
leaving her said and with an expression half serious half arch 
well i heartily wish your concert may answer and do not fail me 
to morrow if you can come for i begin to have a foreboding 
that i may not have many more visits from you 
anne was startled and confused but after standing in a moment s suspense 
was obliged and not sorry to be obliged to hurry away 
chapter 
sir walter his two daughters and mrs clay were the earliest 
of all their party at the rooms in the evening and as lady dalrymple 
must be waited for they took their station by one of the fires 
in the octagon room but hardly were they so settled when the door 
opened again and captain wentworth walked in alone anne was 
the nearest to him and making yet a little advance she instantly spoke 
he was preparing only to bow and pass on but her gentle how do you do 
brought him out of the straight line to stand near her and make enquiries 
in return in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back ground 
their being in the back ground was a support to anne she knew nothing 
of their looks and felt equal to everything which she believed 
right to be done 
while they were speaking a whispering between her father and elizabeth 
caught her ear she could not distinguish but she must guess the subject 
and on captain wentworth s making a distant bow she comprehended 
that her father had judged so well as to give him that 
simple acknowledgement of acquaintance and she was just in time 
by a side glance to see a slight curtsey from elizabeth herself 
this though late and reluctant and ungracious was yet 
better than nothing and her spirits improved 
after talking however of the weather and bath and the concert 
their conversation began to flag and so little was said at last 
that she was expecting him to go every moment but he did not 
he seemed in no hurry to leave her and presently with renewed spirit 
with a little smile a little glow he said 
i have hardly seen you since our day at lyme i am afraid you must have 
suffered from the shock and the more from its not overpowering you 
at the time 
she assured him that she had not 
it was a frightful hour said he a frightful day and he 
passed his hand across his eyes as if the remembrance were still 
too painful but in a moment half smiling again added 
the day has produced some effects however has had some consequences 
which must be considered as the very reverse of frightful 
when you had the presence of mind to suggest that benwick would be 
the properest person to fetch a surgeon you could have little idea 
of his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery 
certainly i could have none but it appears i should hope it would be 
a very happy match there are on both sides good principles 
and good temper 
yes said he looking not exactly forward but there i think 
ends the resemblance with all my soul i wish them happy and rejoice 
over every circumstance in favour of it they have no difficulties 
to contend with at home no opposition no caprice no delays 
the musgroves are behaving like themselves most honourably and kindly 
only anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughter s comfort 
all this is much very much in favour of their happiness 
more than perhaps 
he stopped a sudden recollection seemed to occur and to give him 
some taste of that emotion which was reddening anne s cheeks 
and fixing her eyes on the ground after clearing his throat however 
he proceeded thus 
i confess that i do think there is a disparity too great a disparity 
and in a point no less essential than mind i regard louisa musgrove 
as a very amiable sweet tempered girl and not deficient in understanding 
but benwick is something more he is a clever man a reading man 
and i confess that i do consider his attaching himself to her 
with some surprise had it been the effect of gratitude 
had he learnt to love her because he believed her to be preferring him 
it would have been another thing but i have no reason to suppose it so 
it seems on the contrary to have been a perfectly spontaneous 
untaught feeling on his side and this surprises me a man like him 
in his situation with a heart pierced wounded almost broken 
fanny harville was a very superior creature and his attachment to her 
was indeed attachment a man does not recover from such 
a devotion of the heart to such a woman he ought not he does not 
either from the consciousness however that his friend had recovered 
or from other consciousness he went no farther and anne who 
in spite of the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered 
and in spite of all the various noises of the room the almost ceaseless 
slam of the door and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through 
had distinguished every word was struck gratified confused 
and beginning to breathe very quick and feel an hundred things 
in a moment it was impossible for her to enter on such a subject 
and yet after a pause feeling the necessity of speaking 
and having not the smallest wish for a total change she only deviated 
so far as to say 
you were a good while at lyme i think 
about a fortnight i could not leave it till louisa s doing well 
was quite ascertained i had been too deeply concerned in the mischief 
to be soon at peace it had been my doing solely mine 
she would not have been obstinate if i had not been weak 
the country round lyme is very fine i walked and rode a great deal 
and the more i saw the more i found to admire 
i should very much like to see lyme again said anne 
indeed i should not have supposed that you could have found 
anything in lyme to inspire such a feeling the horror and distress 
you were involved in the stretch of mind the wear of spirits 
i should have thought your last impressions of lyme must have been 
strong disgust 
the last hours were certainly very painful replied anne 
but when pain is over the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure 
one does not love a place the less for having suffered in it 
unless it has been all suffering nothing but suffering which was 
by no means the case at lyme we were only in anxiety and distress 
during the last two hours and previously there had been a great deal 
of enjoyment so much novelty and beauty i have travelled so little 
that every fresh place would be interesting to me but there is real beauty 
at lyme and in short with a faint blush at some recollections 
altogether my impressions of the place are very agreeable 
as she ceased the entrance door opened again and the very party appeared 
for whom they were waiting lady dalrymple lady dalrymple 
was the rejoicing sound and with all the eagerness compatible 
with anxious elegance sir walter and his two ladies stepped forward 
to meet her lady dalrymple and miss carteret escorted by mr elliot 
and colonel wallis who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant 
advanced into the room the others joined them and it was 
a group in which anne found herself also necessarily included 
she was divided from captain wentworth their interesting 
almost too interesting conversation must be broken up for a time 
but slight was the penance compared with the happiness which brought it on 
she had learnt in the last ten minutes more of his feelings 
towards louisa more of all his feelings than she dared to think of 
and she gave herself up to the demands of the party to the needful 
civilities of the moment with exquisite though agitated sensations 
she was in good humour with all she had received ideas which 
disposed her to be courteous and kind to all and to pity every one 
as being less happy than herself 
the delightful emotions were a little subdued when on stepping back 
from the group to be joined again by captain wentworth she saw 
that he was gone she was just in time to see him turn into 
the concert room he was gone he had disappeared she felt 
a moment s regret but they should meet again he would look for her 
he would find her out before the evening were over and at present 
perhaps it was as well to be asunder she was in need of 
a little interval for recollection 
upon lady russell s appearance soon afterwards the whole party 
was collected and all that remained was to marshal themselves 
and proceed into the concert room and be of all the consequence 
in their power draw as many eyes excite as many whispers 
and disturb as many people as they could 
very very happy were both elizabeth and anne elliot as they walked in 
elizabeth arm in arm with miss carteret and looking on the broad back 
of the dowager viscountess dalrymple before her had nothing to wish for 
which did not seem within her reach and anne but it would be 
an insult to the nature of anne s felicity to draw any comparison 
between it and her sister s the origin of one all selfish vanity 
of the other all generous attachment 
anne saw nothing thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room 
her happiness was from within her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed 
but she knew nothing about it she was thinking only of 
the last half hour and as they passed to their seats her mind took 
a hasty range over it his choice of subjects his expressions 
and still more his manner and look had been such as she could see 
in only one light his opinion of louisa musgrove s inferiority 
an opinion which he had seemed solicitous to give his wonder 
at captain benwick his feelings as to a first strong attachment 
sentences begun which he could not finish his half averted eyes 
and more than half expressive glance all all declared that he had 
a heart returning to her at least that anger resentment avoidance 
were no more and that they were succeeded not merely by friendship 
and regard but by the tenderness of the past yes some share of 
the tenderness of the past she could not contemplate the change 
as implying less he must love her 
these were thoughts with their attendant visions which occupied 
and flurried her too much to leave her any power of observation 
and she passed along the room without having a glimpse of him 
without even trying to discern him when their places were determined on 
and they were all properly arranged she looked round to see 
if he should happen to be in the same part of the room but he was not 
her eye could not reach him and the concert being just opening 
she must consent for a time to be happy in a humbler way 
the party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches 
anne was among those on the foremost and mr elliot had manoeuvred so well 
with the assistance of his friend colonel wallis as to have a seat by her 
miss elliot surrounded by her cousins and the principal object 
of colonel wallis s gallantry was quite contented 
anne s mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment 
of the evening it was just occupation enough she had feelings for 
the tender spirits for the gay attention for the scientific 
and patience for the wearisome and had never liked a concert better 
at least during the first act towards the close of it 
in the interval succeeding an italian song she explained 
the words of the song to mr elliot they had a concert bill between them 
this said she is nearly the sense or rather the meaning of the words 
for certainly the sense of an italian love song must not be talked of 
but it is as nearly the meaning as i can give for i do not pretend 
to understand the language i am a very poor italian scholar 
yes yes i see you are i see you know nothing of the matter 
you have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight 
these inverted transposed curtailed italian lines into clear 
comprehensible elegant english you need not say anything more 
of your ignorance here is complete proof 
i will not oppose such kind politeness but i should be sorry to be 
examined by a real proficient 
i have not had the pleasure of visiting in camden place so long 
replied he without knowing something of miss anne elliot 
and i do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general 
to be aware of half her accomplishments and too highly accomplished 
for modesty to be natural in any other woman 
for shame for shame this is too much flattery i forget what we are 
to have next turning to the bill 
perhaps said mr elliot speaking low i have had a longer acquaintance 
with your character than you are aware of 
indeed how so you can have been acquainted with it only since 
i came to bath excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of 
in my own family 
i knew you by report long before you came to bath i had heard you 
described by those who knew you intimately i have been acquainted 
with you by character many years your person your disposition 
accomplishments manner they were all present to me 
mr elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise 
no one can withstand the charm of such a mystery to have been 
described long ago to a recent acquaintance by nameless people 
is irresistible and anne was all curiosity she wondered 
and questioned him eagerly but in vain he delighted in being asked 
but he would not tell 
no no some time or other perhaps but not now he would mention 
no names now but such he could assure her had been the fact 
he had many years ago received such a description of miss anne elliot 
as had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit and excited 
the warmest curiosity to know her 
anne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with 
partiality of her many years ago as the mr wentworth of monkford 
captain wentworth s brother he might have been in mr elliot s company 
but she had not courage to ask the question 
the name of anne elliot said he has long had an interesting sound to me 
very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy and if i dared 
i would breathe my wishes that the name might never change 
such she believed were his words but scarcely had she 
received their sound than her attention was caught by other sounds 
immediately behind her which rendered every thing else trivial 
her father and lady dalrymple were speaking 
a well looking man said sir walter a very well looking man 
a very fine young man indeed said lady dalrymple more air 
than one often sees in bath irish i dare say 
no i just know his name a bowing acquaintance wentworth 
captain wentworth of the navy his sister married my tenant 
in somersetshire the croft who rents kellynch 
before sir walter had reached this point anne s eyes had caught 
the right direction and distinguished captain wentworth standing 
among a cluster of men at a little distance as her eyes fell on him 
his seemed to be withdrawn from her it had that appearance 
it seemed as if she had been one moment too late and as long as she 
dared observe he did not look again but the performance 
was recommencing and she was forced to seem to restore her attention 
to the orchestra and look straight forward 
when she could give another glance he had moved away he could not have 
come nearer to her if he would she was so surrounded and shut in 
but she would rather have caught his eye 
mr elliot s speech too distressed her she had no longer 
any inclination to talk to him she wished him not so near her 
the first act was over now she hoped for some beneficial change 
and after a period of nothing saying amongst the party some of them 
did decide on going in quest of tea anne was one of the few who 
did not choose to move she remained in her seat and so did lady russell 
but she had the pleasure of getting rid of mr elliot and she did not mean 
whatever she might feel on lady russell s account to shrink from 
conversation with captain wentworth if he gave her the opportunity 
she was persuaded by lady russell s countenance that she had seen him 
he did not come however anne sometimes fancied she discerned him 
at a distance but he never came the anxious interval 
wore away unproductively the others returned the room filled again 
benches were reclaimed and repossessed and another hour of pleasure 
or of penance was to be sat out another hour of music was to give 
delight or the gapes as real or affected taste for it prevailed 
to anne it chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation 
she could not quit that room in peace without seeing captain wentworth 
once more without the interchange of one friendly look 
in re settling themselves there were now many changes the result of which 
was favourable for her colonel wallis declined sitting down again 
and mr elliot was invited by elizabeth and miss carteret in a manner 
not to be refused to sit between them and by some other removals 
and a little scheming of her own anne was enabled to place herself 
much nearer the end of the bench than she had been before 
much more within reach of a passer by she could not do so 
without comparing herself with miss larolles the inimitable miss larolles 
but still she did it and not with much happier effect 
though by what seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication 
in her next neighbours she found herself at the very end of the bench 
before the concert closed 
such was her situation with a vacant space at hand when captain wentworth 
was again in sight she saw him not far off he saw her too 
yet he looked grave and seemed irresolute and only by very slow degrees 
came at last near enough to speak to her she felt that something 
must be the matter the change was indubitable the difference 
between his present air and what it had been in the octagon room 
was strikingly great why was it she thought of her father 
of lady russell could there have been any unpleasant glances 
he began by speaking of the concert gravely more like the captain 
wentworth of uppercross owned himself disappointed had expected singing 
and in short must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over 
anne replied and spoke in defence of the performance so well 
and yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly that his countenance 
improved and he replied again with almost a smile they talked 
for a few minutes more the improvement held he even looked down 
towards the bench as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying 
when at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged anne to turn round 
it came from mr elliot he begged her pardon but she must be applied to 
to explain italian again miss carteret was very anxious to have 
a general idea of what was next to be sung anne could not refuse 
but never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit 
a few minutes though as few as possible were inevitably consumed 
and when her own mistress again when able to turn and look 
as she had done before she found herself accosted by captain wentworth 
in a reserved yet hurried sort of farewell he must wish her good night 
he was going he should get home as fast as he could 
is not this song worth staying for said anne suddenly struck 
by an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging 
no he replied impressively there is nothing worth my staying for 
and he was gone directly 
jealousy of mr elliot it was the only intelligible motive 
captain wentworth jealous of her affection could she have believed it 
a week ago three hours ago for a moment the gratification was exquisite 
but alas there were very different thoughts to succeed 
how was such jealousy to be quieted how was the truth to reach him 
how in all the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations 
would he ever learn of her real sentiments it was misery to think 
of mr elliot s attentions their evil was incalculable 
chapter 
anne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise 
of going to mrs smith meaning that it should engage her from home 
at the time when mr elliot would be most likely to call for to avoid 
mr elliot was almost a first object 
she felt a great deal of good will towards him in spite of 
the mischief of his attentions she owed him gratitude and regard 
perhaps compassion she could not help thinking much of the extraordinary 
circumstances attending their acquaintance of the right which 
he seemed to have to interest her by everything in situation 
by his own sentiments by his early prepossession it was altogether 
very extraordinary flattering but painful there was much to regret 
how she might have felt had there been no captain wentworth in the case 
was not worth enquiry for there was a captain wentworth 
and be the conclusion of the present suspense good or bad 
her affection would be his for ever their union she believed 
could not divide her more from other men than their final separation 
prettier musings of high wrought love and eternal constancy 
could never have passed along the streets of bath than anne 
was sporting with from camden place to westgate buildings 
it was almost enough to spread purification and perfume all the way 
she was sure of a pleasant reception and her friend seemed this morning 
particularly obliged to her for coming seemed hardly to have expected her 
though it had been an appointment 
an account of the concert was immediately claimed and anne s recollections 
of the concert were quite happy enough to animate her features 
and make her rejoice to talk of it all that she could tell 
she told most gladly but the all was little for one who had been there 
and unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as mrs smith who had 
already heard through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter 
rather more of the general success and produce of the evening 
than anne could relate and who now asked in vain for several particulars 
of the company everybody of any consequence or notoriety in bath 
was well know by name to mrs smith 
the little durands were there i conclude said she with their mouths 
open to catch the music like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed 
they never miss a concert 
yes i did not see them myself but i heard mr elliot say they were 
in the room 
the ibbotsons were they there and the two new beauties 
with the tall irish officer who is talked of for one of them 
i do not know i do not think they were 
old lady mary maclean i need not ask after her she never misses 
i know and you must have seen her she must have been in your own circle 
for as you went with lady dalrymple you were in the seats of grandeur 
round the orchestra of course 
no that was what i dreaded it would have been very unpleasant to me 
in every respect but happily lady dalrymple always chooses 
to be farther off and we were exceedingly well placed that is 
for hearing i must not say for seeing because i appear to have seen 
very little 
oh you saw enough for your own amusement i can understand 
there is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd 
and this you had you were a large party in yourselves 
and you wanted nothing beyond 
but i ought to have looked about me more said anne conscious 
while she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about 
that the object only had been deficient 
no no you were better employed you need not tell me that you 
had a pleasant evening i see it in your eye i perfectly see 
how the hours passed that you had always something agreeable 
to listen to in the intervals of the concert it was conversation 
anne half smiled and said do you see that in my eye 
yes i do your countenance perfectly informs me that you were 
in company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable 
in the world the person who interests you at this present time 
more than all the rest of the world put together 
a blush overspread anne s cheeks she could say nothing 
and such being the case continued mrs smith after a short pause 
i hope you believe that i do know how to value your kindness 
in coming to me this morning it is really very good of you 
to come and sit with me when you must have so many pleasanter demands 
upon your time 
anne heard nothing of this she was still in the astonishment and 
confusion excited by her friend s penetration unable to imagine 
how any report of captain wentworth could have reached her 
after another short silence 
pray said mrs smith is mr elliot aware of your acquaintance with me 
does he know that i am in bath 
mr elliot repeated anne looking up surprised a moment s reflection 
shewed her the mistake she had been under she caught it instantaneously 
and recovering her courage with the feeling of safety soon added 
more composedly are you acquainted with mr elliot 
i have been a good deal acquainted with him replied mrs smith gravely 
but it seems worn out now it is a great while since we met 
i was not at all aware of this you never mentioned it before 
had i known it i would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you 
to confess the truth said mrs smith assuming her usual 
air of cheerfulness that is exactly the pleasure i want you to have 
i want you to talk about me to mr elliot i want your interest with him 
he can be of essential service to me and if you would have the goodness 
my dear miss elliot to make it an object to yourself 
of course it is done 
i should be extremely happy i hope you cannot doubt my willingness 
to be of even the slightest use to you replied anne but i suspect 
that you are considering me as having a higher claim on mr elliot 
a greater right to influence him than is really the case 
i am sure you have somehow or other imbibed such a notion 
you must consider me only as mr elliot s relation if in that light 
there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him 
i beg you would not hesitate to employ me 
mrs smith gave her a penetrating glance and then smiling said 
i have been a little premature i perceive i beg your pardon 
i ought to have waited for official information but now my dear 
miss elliot as an old friend do give me a hint as to when i may speak 
next week to be sure by next week i may be allowed to 
think it all settled and build my own selfish schemes on 
mr elliot s good fortune 
no replied anne nor next week nor next nor next 
i assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of 
will be settled any week i am not going to marry mr elliot 
i should like to know why you imagine i am 
mrs smith looked at her again looked earnestly smiled 
shook her head and exclaimed 
now how i do wish i understood you how i do wish i knew 
what you were at i have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel 
when the right moment occurs till it does come you know 
we women never mean to have anybody it is a thing of course among us 
that every man is refused till he offers but why should you be cruel 
let me plead for my present friend i cannot call him but for 
my former friend where can you look for a more suitable match 
where could you expect a more gentlemanlike agreeable man 
let me recommend mr elliot i am sure you hear nothing but good of him 
from colonel wallis and who can know him better than colonel wallis 
my dear mrs smith mr elliot s wife has not been dead much above 
half a year he ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses 
to any one 
oh if these are your only objections cried mrs smith archly 
mr elliot is safe and i shall give myself no more trouble about him 
do not forget me when you are married that is all let him know me to be 
a friend of yours and then he will think little of the trouble required 
which it is very natural for him now with so many affairs and engagements 
of his own to avoid and get rid of as he can very natural perhaps 
ninety nine out of a hundred would do the same of course 
he cannot be aware of the importance to me well my dear miss elliot 
i hope and trust you will be very happy mr elliot has sense 
to understand the value of such a woman your peace will not be 
shipwrecked as mine has been you are safe in all worldly matters 
and safe in his character he will not be led astray he will not be 
misled by others to his ruin 
no said anne i can readily believe all that of my cousin 
he seems to have a calm decided temper not at all open 
to dangerous impressions i consider him with great respect 
i have no reason from any thing that has fallen within my observation 
to do otherwise but i have not known him long and he is not a man 
i think to be known intimately soon will not this manner 
of speaking of him mrs smith convince you that he is nothing to me 
surely this must be calm enough and upon my word he is nothing to me 
should he ever propose to me which i have very little reason to imagine 
he has any thought of doing i shall not accept him i assure you 
i shall not i assure you mr elliot had not the share which 
you have been supposing in whatever pleasure the concert 
of last night might afford not mr elliot it is not mr elliot that 
she stopped regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much 
but less would hardly have been sufficient mrs smith would hardly 
have believed so soon in mr elliot s failure but from the perception 
of there being a somebody else as it was she instantly submitted 
and with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond and anne 
eager to escape farther notice was impatient to know why mrs smith 
should have fancied she was to marry mr elliot where she could have 
received the idea or from whom she could have heard it 
do tell me how it first came into your head 
it first came into my head replied mrs smith upon finding how much 
you were together and feeling it to be the most probable thing 
in the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you 
and you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you 
in the same way but i never heard it spoken of till two days ago 
and has it indeed been spoken of 
did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when 
you called yesterday 
no was not it mrs speed as usual or the maid i observed 
no one in particular 
it was my friend mrs rooke nurse rooke who by the bye 
had a great curiosity to see you and was delighted to be in the way 
to let you in she came away from marlborough buildings only on sunday 
and she it was who told me you were to marry mr elliot 
she had had it from mrs wallis herself which did not seem bad authority 
she sat an hour with me on monday evening and gave me the whole history 
the whole history repeated anne laughing she could not make 
a very long history i think of one such little article 
of unfounded news 
mrs smith said nothing 
but continued anne presently though there is no truth in my having 
this claim on mr elliot i should be extremely happy to be of use to you 
in any way that i could shall i mention to him your being in bath 
shall i take any message 
no i thank you no certainly not in the warmth of the moment 
and under a mistaken impression i might perhaps have endeavoured 
to interest you in some circumstances but not now no i thank you 
i have nothing to trouble you with 
i think you spoke of having known mr elliot many years 
i did 
not before he was married i suppose 
yes he was not married when i knew him first 
and were you much acquainted 
intimately 
indeed then do tell me what he was at that time of life 
i have a great curiosity to know what mr elliot was as a very young man 
was he at all such as he appears now 
i have not seen mr elliot these three years was mrs smith s answer 
given so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther 
and anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity 
they were both silent mrs smith very thoughtful at last 
i beg your pardon my dear miss elliot she cried in her 
natural tone of cordiality i beg your pardon for the short answers 
i have been giving you but i have been uncertain what i ought to do 
i have been doubting and considering as to what i ought to tell you 
there were many things to be taken into the account one hates 
to be officious to be giving bad impressions making mischief 
even the smooth surface of family union seems worth preserving 
though there may be nothing durable beneath however i have determined 
i think i am right i think you ought to be made acquainted 
with mr elliot s real character though i fully believe that 
at present you have not the smallest intention of accepting him 
there is no saying what may happen you might some time or other 
be differently affected towards him hear the truth therefore 
now while you are unprejudiced mr elliot is a man without heart 
or conscience a designing wary cold blooded being who thinks 
only of himself whom for his own interest or ease would be guilty 
of any cruelty or any treachery that could be perpetrated without 
risk of his general character he has no feeling for others 
those whom he has been the chief because of leading into ruin 
he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction 
he is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion 
oh he is black at heart hollow and black 
anne s astonished air and exclamation of wonder made her pause 
and in a calmer manner she added 
my expressions startle you you must allow for an injured angry woman 
but i will try to command myself i will not abuse him 
i will only tell you what i have found him facts shall speak 
he was the intimate friend of my dear husband who trusted and loved him 
and thought him as good as himself the intimacy had been formed 
before our marriage i found them most intimate friends and i too 
became excessively pleased with mr elliot and entertained 
the highest opinion of him at nineteen you know one does not 
think very seriously but mr elliot appeared to me quite as good as others 
and much more agreeable than most others and we were almost 
always together we were principally in town living in very good style 
he was then the inferior in circumstances he was then the poor one 
he had chambers in the temple and it was as much as he could do 
to support the appearance of a gentleman he had always a home 
with us whenever he chose it he was always welcome he was like a brother 
my poor charles who had the finest most generous spirit in the world 
would have divided his last farthing with him and i know that his purse 
was open to him i know that he often assisted him 
this must have been about that very period of mr elliot s life 
said anne which has always excited my particular curiosity 
it must have been about the same time that he became known to 
my father and sister i never knew him myself i only heard of him 
but there was a something in his conduct then with regard to 
my father and sister and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage 
which i never could quite reconcile with present times it seemed 
to announce a different sort of man 
i know it all i know it all cried mrs smith he had been 
introduced to sir walter and your sister before i was acquainted with him 
but i heard him speak of them for ever i know he was invited 
and encouraged and i know he did not choose to go i can satisfy you 
perhaps on points which you would little expect and as to his marriage 
i knew all about it at the time i was privy to all the fors and againsts 
i was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans and though 
i did not know his wife previously her inferior situation in society 
indeed rendered that impossible yet i knew her all her life afterwards 
or at least till within the last two years of her life and can answer 
any question you may wish to put 
nay said anne i have no particular enquiry to make about her 
i have always understood they were not a happy couple but i should 
like to know why at that time of his life he should slight 
my father s acquaintance as he did my father was certainly disposed 
to take very kind and proper notice of him why did mr elliot draw back 
mr elliot replied mrs smith at that period of his life 
had one object in view to make his fortune and by a rather quicker 
process than the law he was determined to make it by marriage 
he was determined at least not to mar it by an imprudent marriage 
and i know it was his belief whether justly or not of course 
i cannot decide that your father and sister in their civilities 
and invitations were designing a match between the heir 
and the young lady and it was impossible that such a match 
should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence 
that was his motive for drawing back i can assure you 
he told me the whole story he had no concealments with me 
it was curious that having just left you behind me in bath 
my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin 
and that through him i should be continually hearing of your father 
and sister he described one miss elliot and i thought 
very affectionately of the other 
perhaps cried anne struck by a sudden idea you sometimes 
spoke of me to mr elliot 
to be sure i did very often i used to boast of my own anne elliot 
and vouch for your being a very different creature from 
she checked herself just in time 
this accounts for something which mr elliot said last night 
cried anne this explains it i found he had been used to hear of me 
i could not comprehend how what wild imaginations one forms where 
dear self is concerned how sure to be mistaken but i beg your pardon 
i have interrupted you mr elliot married then completely for money 
the circumstances probably which first opened your eyes 
to his character 
mrs smith hesitated a little here oh those things are too common 
when one lives in the world a man or woman s marrying for money 
is too common to strike one as it ought i was very young 
and associated only with the young and we were a thoughtless 
gay set without any strict rules of conduct we lived for enjoyment 
i think differently now time and sickness and sorrow have given me 
other notions but at that period i must own i saw nothing reprehensible 
in what mr elliot was doing to do the best for himself 
passed as a duty 
but was not she a very low woman 
yes which i objected to but he would not regard money money 
was all that he wanted her father was a grazier her grandfather 
had been a butcher but that was all nothing she was a fine woman 
had had a decent education was brought forward by some cousins 
thrown by chance into mr elliot s company and fell in love with him 
and not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side 
with respect to her birth all his caution was spent in being secured 
of the real amount of her fortune before he committed himself 
depend upon it whatever esteem mr elliot may have for his own situation 
in life now as a young man he had not the smallest value for it 
his chance for the kellynch estate was something but all the honour 
of the family he held as cheap as dirt i have often heard him declare 
that if baronetcies were saleable anybody should have his 
for fifty pounds arms and motto name and livery included 
but i will not pretend to repeat half that i used to hear him say 
on that subject it would not be fair and yet you ought to have proof 
for what is all this but assertion and you shall have proof 
indeed my dear mrs smith i want none cried anne you have asserted 
nothing contradictory to what mr elliot appeared to be some years ago 
this is all in confirmation rather of what we used to hear and believe 
i am more curious to know why he should be so different now 
but for my satisfaction if you will have the goodness to ring for mary 
stay i am sure you will have the still greater goodness of 
going yourself into my bedroom and bringing me the small inlaid box 
which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet 
anne seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it did as she was desired 
the box was brought and placed before her and mrs smith sighing over it 
as she unlocked it said 
this is full of papers belonging to him to my husband 
a small portion only of what i had to look over when i lost him 
the letter i am looking for was one written by mr elliot to him 
before our marriage and happened to be saved why one can hardly imagine 
but he was careless and immethodical like other men about those things 
and when i came to examine his papers i found it with others 
still more trivial from different people scattered here and there 
while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed 
here it is i would not burn it because being even then very little 
satisfied with mr elliot i was determined to preserve every document 
of former intimacy i have now another motive for being glad 
that i can produce it 
this was the letter directed to charles smith esq tunbridge wells 
and dated from london as far back as july 
dear smith i have received yours your kindness almost overpowers me 
i wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common but i have 
lived three and twenty years in the world and have seen none like it 
at present believe me i have no need of your services 
being in cash again give me joy i have got rid of sir walter and miss 
they are gone back to kellynch and almost made me swear to visit them 
this summer but my first visit to kellynch will be with a surveyor 
to tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer 
the baronet nevertheless is not unlikely to marry again 
he is quite fool enough if he does however they will leave me in peace 
which may be a decent equivalent for the reversion he is worse 
than last year 
i wish i had any name but elliot i am sick of it the name of walter 
i can drop thank god and i desire you will never insult me 
with my second w again meaning for the rest of my life 
to be only yours truly wm elliot 
such a letter could not be read without putting anne in a glow 
and mrs smith observing the high colour in her face said 
the language i know is highly disrespectful though i have forgot 
the exact terms i have a perfect impression of the general meaning 
but it shows you the man mark his professions to my poor husband 
can any thing be stronger 
anne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification 
of finding such words applied to her father she was obliged to recollect 
that her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour 
that no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies 
that no private correspondence could bear the eye of others 
before she could recover calmness enough to return the letter 
which she had been meditating over and say 
thank you this is full proof undoubtedly proof of every thing 
you were saying but why be acquainted with us now 
i can explain this too cried mrs smith smiling 
can you really 
yes i have shewn you mr elliot as he was a dozen years ago 
and i will shew him as he is now i cannot produce written proof again 
but i can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire of what 
he is now wanting and what he is now doing he is no hypocrite now 
he truly wants to marry you his present attentions to your family 
are very sincere quite from the heart i will give you my authority 
his friend colonel wallis 
colonel wallis you are acquainted with him 
no it does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that 
it takes a bend or two but nothing of consequence the stream 
is as good as at first the little rubbish it collects in the turnings 
is easily moved away mr elliot talks unreservedly to colonel wallis 
of his views on you which said colonel wallis i imagine to be 
in himself a sensible careful discerning sort of character 
but colonel wallis has a very pretty silly wife to whom 
he tells things which he had better not and he repeats it all to her 
she in the overflowing spirits of her recovery repeats it all 
to her nurse and the nurse knowing my acquaintance with you 
very naturally brings it all to me on monday evening my good friend 
mrs rooke let me thus much into the secrets of marlborough buildings 
when i talked of a whole history therefore you see i was 
not romancing so much as you supposed 
my dear mrs smith your authority is deficient this will not do 
mr elliot s having any views on me will not in the least account 
for the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father 
that was all prior to my coming to bath i found them on 
the most friendly terms when i arrived 
i know you did i know it all perfectly but 
indeed mrs smith we must not expect to get real information 
in such a line facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands 
of so many to be misconceived by folly in one and ignorance in another 
can hardly have much truth left 
only give me a hearing you will soon be able to judge of 
the general credit due by listening to some particulars 
which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm 
nobody supposes that you were his first inducement he had seen you 
indeed before he came to bath and admired you but without 
knowing it to be you so says my historian at least is this true 
did he see you last summer or autumn somewhere down in the west 
to use her own words without knowing it to be you 
he certainly did so far it is very true at lyme 
i happened to be at lyme 
well continued mrs smith triumphantly grant my friend the credit 
due to the establishment of the first point asserted he saw you then 
at lyme and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased 
to meet with you again in camden place as miss anne elliot 
and from that moment i have no doubt had a double motive 
in his visits there but there was another and an earlier 
which i will now explain if there is anything in my story which you know 
to be either false or improbable stop me my account states 
that your sister s friend the lady now staying with you 
whom i have heard you mention came to bath with miss elliot and sir walter 
as long ago as september in short when they first came themselves 
and has been staying there ever since that she is a clever insinuating 
handsome woman poor and plausible and altogether such in situation 
and manner as to give a general idea among sir walter s acquaintance 
of her meaning to be lady elliot and as general a surprise 
that miss elliot should be apparently blind to the danger 
here mrs smith paused a moment but anne had not a word to say 
and she continued 
this was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family 
long before you returned to it and colonel wallis had his eye 
upon your father enough to be sensible of it though he did not then 
visit in camden place but his regard for mr elliot gave him an interest 
in watching all that was going on there and when mr elliot came to bath 
for a day or two as he happened to do a little before christmas 
colonel wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things 
and the reports beginning to prevail now you are to understand 
that time had worked a very material change in mr elliot s opinions 
as to the value of a baronetcy upon all points of blood and connexion 
he is a completely altered man having long had as much money 
as he could spend nothing to wish for on the side of avarice 
or indulgence he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness 
upon the consequence he is heir to i thought it coming on 
before our acquaintance ceased but it is now a confirmed feeling 
he cannot bear the idea of not being sir william you may guess 
therefore that the news he heard from his friend could not be 
very agreeable and you may guess what it produced the resolution 
of coming back to bath as soon as possible and of fixing himself here 
for a time with the view of renewing his former acquaintance 
and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means 
of ascertaining the degree of his danger and of circumventing the lady 
if he found it material this was agreed upon between the two friends 
as the only thing to be done and colonel wallis was to assist 
in every way that he could he was to be introduced and mrs wallis 
was to be introduced and everybody was to be introduced 
mr elliot came back accordingly and on application was forgiven 
as you know and re admitted into the family and there it was 
his constant object and his only object till your arrival 
added another motive to watch sir walter and mrs clay 
he omitted no opportunity of being with them threw himself in their way 
called at all hours but i need not be particular on this subject 
you can imagine what an artful man would do and with this guide 
perhaps may recollect what you have seen him do 
yes said anne you tell me nothing which does not accord with 
what i have known or could imagine there is always something offensive 
in the details of cunning the manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity 
must ever be revolting but i have heard nothing which really surprises me 
i know those who would be shocked by such a representation of mr elliot 
who would have difficulty in believing it but i have never been satisfied 
i have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared 
i should like to know his present opinion as to the probability 
of the event he has been in dread of whether he considers the danger 
to be lessening or not 
lessening i understand replied mrs smith he thinks mrs clay 
afraid of him aware that he sees through her and not daring to proceed 
as she might do in his absence but since he must be absent 
some time or other i do not perceive how he can ever be secure 
while she holds her present influence mrs wallis has an amusing idea 
as nurse tells me that it is to be put into the marriage articles 
when you and mr elliot marry that your father is not to marry mrs clay 
a scheme worthy of mrs wallis s understanding by all accounts 
but my sensible nurse rooke sees the absurdity of it why to be sure 
madam said she it would not prevent his marrying anybody else 
and indeed to own the truth i do not think nurse in her heart 
is a very strenuous opposer of sir walter s making a second match 
she must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony you know 
and since self will intrude who can say that she may not have 
some flying visions of attending the next lady elliot through 
mrs wallis s recommendation 
i am very glad to know all this said anne after a little 
thoughtfulness it will be more painful to me in some respects 
to be in company with him but i shall know better what to do 
my line of conduct will be more direct mr elliot is evidently 
a disingenuous artificial worldly man who has never had 
any better principle to guide him than selfishness 
but mr elliot was not done with mrs smith had been carried away 
from her first direction and anne had forgotten in the interest 
of her own family concerns how much had been originally implied 
against him but her attention was now called to the explanation 
of those first hints and she listened to a recital which 
if it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of mrs smith 
proved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her 
very deficient both in justice and compassion 
she learned that the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired 
by mr elliot s marriage they had been as before always together 
and mr elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune 
mrs smith did not want to take blame to herself and was most tender 
of throwing any on her husband but anne could collect that their income 
had never been equal to their style of living and that from the first 
there had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance 
from his wife s account of him she could discern mr smith to have been 
a man of warm feelings easy temper careless habits and not strong 
understanding much more amiable than his friend and very unlike him 
led by him and probably despised by him mr elliot raised by 
his marriage to great affluence and disposed to every gratification 
of pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself 
for with all his self indulgence he had become a prudent man 
and beginning to be rich just as his friend ought to have found himself 
to be poor seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend s 
probable finances but on the contrary had been prompting and 
encouraging expenses which could end only in ruin and the smiths 
accordingly had been ruined 
the husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it 
they had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship 
of their friends and to prove that mr elliot s had better not be tried 
but it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs 
was fully known with a confidence in mr elliot s regard 
more creditable to his feelings than his judgement mr smith had 
appointed him the executor of his will but mr elliot would not act 
and the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her 
in addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation had been such 
as could not be related without anguish of spirit or listened to 
without corresponding indignation 
anne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion answers to 
urgent applications from mrs smith which all breathed the same 
stern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble and 
under a cold civility the same hard hearted indifference 
to any of the evils it might bring on her it was a dreadful picture 
of ingratitude and inhumanity and anne felt at some moments 
that no flagrant open crime could have been worse she had a great deal 
to listen to all the particulars of past sad scenes all the minutiae 
of distress upon distress which in former conversations had been 
merely hinted at were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence 
anne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief and was only 
the more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friend s 
usual state of mind 
there was one circumstance in the history of her grievances 
of particular irritation she had good reason to believe that 
some property of her husband in the west indies which had been 
for many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment 
of its own incumbrances might be recoverable by proper measures 
and this property though not large would be enough to make 
her comparatively rich but there was nobody to stir in it 
mr elliot would do nothing and she could do nothing herself 
equally disabled from personal exertion by her state of 
bodily weakness and from employing others by her want of money 
she had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel 
and she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law 
this was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means 
to feel that she ought to be in better circumstances 
that a little trouble in the right place might do it 
and to fear that delay might be even weakening her claims 
was hard to bear 
it was on this point that she had hoped to engage anne s good offices 
with mr elliot she had previously in the anticipation 
of their marriage been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it 
but on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature 
since he did not even know her to be in bath it immediately occurred 
that something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman 
he loved and she had been hastily preparing to interest anne s feelings 
as far as the observances due to mr elliot s character would allow 
when anne s refutation of the supposed engagement changed 
the face of everything and while it took from her the new formed hope 
of succeeding in the object of her first anxiety left her at least 
the comfort of telling the whole story her own way 
after listening to this full description of mr elliot anne could not but 
express some surprise at mrs smith s having spoken of him so favourably 
in the beginning of their conversation she had seemed to recommend 
and praise him 
my dear was mrs smith s reply there was nothing else to be done 
i considered your marrying him as certain though he might not yet 
have made the offer and i could no more speak the truth of him 
than if he had been your husband my heart bled for you 
as i talked of happiness and yet he is sensible he is agreeable 
and with such a woman as you it was not absolutely hopeless 
he was very unkind to his first wife they were wretched together 
but she was too ignorant and giddy for respect and he had never loved her 
i was willing to hope that you must fare better 
anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility 
of having been induced to marry him as made her shudder at the idea 
of the misery which must have followed it was just possible that 
she might have been persuaded by lady russell and under such 
a supposition which would have been most miserable when time had 
disclosed all too late 
it was very desirable that lady russell should be no longer deceived 
and one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference 
which carried them through the greater part of the morning 
was that anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend 
everything relative to mrs smith in which his conduct was involved 
chapter 
anne went home to think over all that she had heard in one point 
her feelings were relieved by this knowledge of mr elliot 
there was no longer anything of tenderness due to him he stood as 
opposed to captain wentworth in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness 
and the evil of his attentions last night the irremediable mischief 
he might have done was considered with sensations unqualified unperplexed 
pity for him was all over but this was the only point of relief 
in every other respect in looking around her or penetrating forward 
she saw more to distrust and to apprehend she was concerned 
for the disappointment and pain lady russell would be feeling 
for the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister 
and had all the distress of foreseeing many evils without knowing 
how to avert any one of them she was most thankful for her own 
knowledge of him she had never considered herself as entitled to reward 
for not slighting an old friend like mrs smith but here was 
a reward indeed springing from it mrs smith had been able to tell her 
what no one else could have done could the knowledge have 
been extended through her family but this was a vain idea 
she must talk to lady russell tell her consult with her 
and having done her best wait the event with as much composure 
as possible and after all her greatest want of composure would be 
in that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to lady russell 
in that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself 
she found on reaching home that she had as she intended 
escaped seeing mr elliot that he had called and paid them 
a long morning visit but hardly had she congratulated herself 
and felt safe when she heard that he was coming again in the evening 
i had not the smallest intention of asking him said elizabeth 
with affected carelessness but he gave so many hints 
so mrs clay says at least 
indeed i do say it i never saw anybody in my life spell harder 
for an invitation poor man i was really in pain for him 
for your hard hearted sister miss anne seems bent on cruelty 
oh cried elizabeth i have been rather too much used to the game 
to be soon overcome by a gentleman s hints however when i found 
how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father 
this morning i gave way immediately for i would never really omit 
an opportunity of bring him and sir walter together they appear to 
so much advantage in company with each other each behaving so pleasantly 
mr elliot looking up with so much respect 
quite delightful cried mrs clay not daring however 
to turn her eyes towards anne exactly like father and son 
dear miss elliot may i not say father and son 
oh i lay no embargo on any body s words if you will have such 
ideas but upon my word i am scarcely sensible of his attentions 
being beyond those of other men 
my dear miss elliot exclaimed mrs clay lifting her hands and eyes 
and sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence 
well my dear penelope you need not be so alarmed about him 
i did invite him you know i sent him away with smiles 
when i found he was really going to his friends at thornberry park 
for the whole day to morrow i had compassion on him 
anne admired the good acting of the friend in being able to shew 
such pleasure as she did in the expectation and in the actual arrival 
of the very person whose presence must really be interfering with 
her prime object it was impossible but that mrs clay must hate 
the sight of mr elliot and yet she could assume a most obliging 
placid look and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license 
of devoting herself only half as much to sir walter as she would have 
done otherwise 
to anne herself it was most distressing to see mr elliot enter the room 
and quite painful to have him approach and speak to her 
she had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere 
but now she saw insincerity in everything his attentive deference 
to her father contrasted with his former language was odious 
and when she thought of his cruel conduct towards mrs smith 
she could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness 
or the sound of his artificial good sentiments 
she meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke 
a remonstrance on his side it was a great object to her to escape 
all enquiry or eclat but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool 
to him as might be compatible with their relationship and to retrace 
as quietly as she could the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had 
been gradually led along she was accordingly more guarded 
and more cool than she had been the night before 
he wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where 
he could have heard her formerly praised wanted very much 
to be gratified by more solicitation but the charm was broken 
he found that the heat and animation of a public room was necessary 
to kindle his modest cousin s vanity he found at least that it was 
not to be done now by any of those attempts which he could hazard 
among the too commanding claims of the others he little surmised 
that it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest 
bringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct 
which were least excusable 
she had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of bath 
the next morning going early and that he would be gone the greater part 
of two days he was invited again to camden place the very evening of 
his return but from thursday to saturday evening his absence was certain 
it was bad enough that a mrs clay should be always before her 
but that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party 
seemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort 
it was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised 
on her father and elizabeth to consider the various sources 
of mortification preparing for them mrs clay s selfishness was 
not so complicate nor so revolting as his and anne would have compounded 
for the marriage at once with all its evils to be clear of mr elliot s 
subtleties in endeavouring to prevent it 
on friday morning she meant to go very early to lady russell 
and accomplish the necessary communication and she would have gone 
directly after breakfast but that mrs clay was also going out 
on some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble which 
determined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion 
she saw mrs clay fairly off therefore before she began to talk 
of spending the morning in rivers street 
very well said elizabeth i have nothing to send but my love 
oh you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me 
and pretend i have read it through i really cannot be plaguing myself 
for ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out 
lady russell quite bores one with her new publications 
you need not tell her so but i thought her dress hideous the other night 
i used to think she had some taste in dress but i was ashamed of her 
at the concert something so formal and arrange in her air 
and she sits so upright my best love of course 
and mine added sir walter kindest regards and you may say 
that i mean to call upon her soon make a civil message 
but i shall only leave my card morning visits are never fair 
by women at her time of life who make themselves up so little 
if she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen 
but last time i called i observed the blinds were let down immediately 
while her father spoke there was a knock at the door who could it be 
anne remembering the preconcerted visits at all hours of mr elliot 
would have expected him but for his known engagement seven miles off 
after the usual period of suspense the usual sounds of approach were heard 
and mr and mrs charles musgrove were ushered into the room 
surprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance 
but anne was really glad to see them and the others were not so sorry 
but that they could put on a decent air of welcome and as soon 
as it became clear that these their nearest relations were not arrived 
with an views of accommodation in that house sir walter and elizabeth 
were able to rise in cordiality and do the honours of it very well 
they were come to bath for a few days with mrs musgrove and were 
at the white hart so much was pretty soon understood 
but till sir walter and elizabeth were walking mary into 
the other drawing room and regaling themselves with her admiration 
anne could not draw upon charles s brain for a regular history 
of their coming or an explanation of some smiling hints 
of particular business which had been ostentatiously dropped by mary 
as well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of 
she then found that it consisted of mrs musgrove henrietta 
and captain harville beside their two selves he gave her a very plain 
intelligible account of the whole a narration in which she saw 
a great deal of most characteristic proceeding the scheme 
had received its first impulse by captain harville s wanting to 
come to bath on business he had begun to talk of it a week ago 
and by way of doing something as shooting was over charles had proposed 
coming with him and mrs harville had seemed to like the idea of it 
very much as an advantage to her husband but mary could not bear 
to be left and had made herself so unhappy about it that for a day or two 
everything seemed to be in suspense or at an end but then 
it had been taken up by his father and mother his mother had 
some old friends in bath whom she wanted to see it was thought 
a good opportunity for henrietta to come and buy wedding clothes 
for herself and her sister and in short it ended in being 
his mother s party that everything might be comfortable and easy 
to captain harville and he and mary were included in it 
by way of general convenience they had arrived late the night before 
mrs harville her children and captain benwick remained with 
mr musgrove and louisa at uppercross 
anne s only surprise was that affairs should be in forwardness enough 
for henrietta s wedding clothes to be talked of she had imagined 
such difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent 
the marriage from being near at hand but she learned from charles that 
very recently since mary s last letter to herself charles hayter 
had been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth 
who could not possibly claim it under many years and that 
on the strength of his present income with almost a certainty 
of something more permanent long before the term in question 
the two families had consented to the young people s wishes 
and that their marriage was likely to take place in a few months 
quite as soon as louisa s and a very good living it was 
charles added only five and twenty miles from uppercross 
and in a very fine country fine part of dorsetshire 
in the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom 
surrounded by three great proprietors each more careful and jealous 
than the other and to two of the three at least charles hayter might get 
a special recommendation not that he will value it as he ought 
he observed charles is too cool about sporting that is the worst of him 
i am extremely glad indeed cried anne particularly glad 
that this should happen and that of two sisters who both deserve 
equally well and who have always been such good friends 
the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other 
that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort 
i hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both 
oh yes my father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer 
but he has no other fault to find money you know coming down with 
money two daughters at once it cannot be a very agreeable operation 
and it streightens him as to many things however i do not mean to say 
they have not a right to it it is very fit they should have 
daughters shares and i am sure he has always been a very kind 
liberal father to me mary does not above half like henrietta s match 
she never did you know but she does not do him justice 
nor think enough about winthrop i cannot make her attend to 
the value of the property it is a very fair match as times go 
and i have liked charles hayter all my life and i shall not leave off now 
such excellent parents as mr and mrs musgrove exclaimed anne 
should be happy in their children s marriages they do everything 
to confer happiness i am sure what a blessing to young people 
to be in such hands your father and mother seem so totally free 
from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct 
and misery both in young and old i hope you think louisa 
perfectly recovered now 
he answered rather hesitatingly yes i believe i do very much recovered 
but she is altered there is no running or jumping about no laughing 
or dancing it is quite different if one happens only to shut the door 
a little hard she starts and wriggles like a young dab chick in the water 
and benwick sits at her elbow reading verses or whispering to her 
all day long 
anne could not help laughing that cannot be much to your taste 
i know said she but i do believe him to be an excellent young man 
to be sure he is nobody doubts it and i hope you do not think 
i am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and 
pleasures as myself i have a great value for benwick and when one can 
but get him to talk he has plenty to say his reading has done him 
no harm for he has fought as well as read he is a brave fellow 
i got more acquainted with him last monday than ever i did before 
we had a famous set to at rat hunting all the morning in 
my father s great barns and he played his part so well 
that i have liked him the better ever since 
here they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of charles s 
following the others to admire mirrors and china but anne had 
heard enough to understand the present state of uppercross 
and rejoice in its happiness and though she sighed as she rejoiced 
her sigh had none of the ill will of envy in it she would certainly 
have risen to their blessings if she could but she did not want 
to lessen theirs 
the visit passed off altogether in high good humour mary was 
in excellent spirits enjoying the gaiety and the change 
and so well satisfied with the journey in her mother in law s carriage 
with four horses and with her own complete independence of camden place 
that she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought 
and enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house 
as they were detailed to her she had no demands on her father or sister 
and her consequence was just enough increased by their handsome 
drawing rooms 
elizabeth was for a short time suffering a good deal 
she felt that mrs musgrove and all her party ought to be asked 
to dine with them but she could not bear to have the difference of style 
the reduction of servants which a dinner must betray witnessed by those 
who had been always so inferior to the elliots of kellynch 
it was a struggle between propriety and vanity but vanity got the better 
and then elizabeth was happy again these were her internal persuasions 
old fashioned notions country hospitality we do not profess 
to give dinners few people in bath do lady alicia never does 
did not even ask her own sister s family though they were here a month 
and i dare say it would be very inconvenient to mrs musgrove 
put her quite out of her way i am sure she would rather not come 
she cannot feel easy with us i will ask them all for an evening 
that will be much better that will be a novelty and a treat 
they have not seen two such drawing rooms before they will be delighted 
to come to morrow evening it shall be a regular party small 
but most elegant and this satisfied elizabeth and when the invitation 
was given to the two present and promised for the absent 
mary was as completely satisfied she was particularly asked 
to meet mr elliot and be introduced to lady dalrymple and miss carteret 
who were fortunately already engaged to come and she could not 
have received a more gratifying attention miss elliot was to have 
the honour of calling on mrs musgrove in the course of the morning 
and anne walked off with charles and mary to go and see her 
and henrietta directly 
her plan of sitting with lady russell must give way for the present 
they all three called in rivers street for a couple of minutes 
but anne convinced herself that a day s delay of the intended communication 
could be of no consequence and hastened forward to the white hart 
to see again the friends and companions of the last autumn 
with an eagerness of good will which many associations contributed to form 
they found mrs musgrove and her daughter within and by themselves 
and anne had the kindest welcome from each henrietta was exactly 
in that state of recently improved views of fresh formed happiness 
which made her full of regard and interest for everybody she had 
ever liked before at all and mrs musgrove s real affection had been won 
by her usefulness when they were in distress it was a heartiness 
and a warmth and a sincerity which anne delighted in the more 
from the sad want of such blessings at home she was entreated 
to give them as much of her time as possible invited for every day 
and all day long or rather claimed as part of the family and in return 
she naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance 
and on charles s leaving them together was listening to mrs musgrove s 
history of louisa and to henrietta s of herself giving opinions 
on business and recommendations to shops with intervals of every help 
which mary required from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts 
from finding her keys and assorting her trinkets to trying 
to convince her that she was not ill used by anybody which mary 
well amused as she generally was in her station at a window 
overlooking the entrance to the pump room could not but have 
her moments of imagining 
a morning of thorough confusion was to be expected a large party 
in an hotel ensured a quick changing unsettled scene one five minutes 
brought a note the next a parcel and anne had not been there 
half an hour when their dining room spacious as it was 
seemed more than half filled a party of steady old friends 
were seated around mrs musgrove and charles came back with 
captains harville and wentworth the appearance of the latter 
could not be more than the surprise of the moment it was impossible 
for her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their 
common friends must be soon bringing them together again 
their last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings 
she had derived from it a delightful conviction but she feared 
from his looks that the same unfortunate persuasion which had 
hastened him away from the concert room still governed 
he did not seem to want to be near enough for conversation 
she tried to be calm and leave things to take their course 
and tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence 
surely if there be constant attachment on each side our hearts 
must understand each other ere long we are not boy and girl 
to be captiously irritable misled by every moment s inadvertence 
and wantonly playing with our own happiness and yet 
a few minutes afterwards she felt as if their being in company 
with each other under their present circumstances could only be 
exposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most 
mischievous kind 
anne cried mary still at her window there is mrs clay 
i am sure standing under the colonnade and a gentleman with her 
i saw them turn the corner from bath street just now they seemed 
deep in talk who is it come and tell me good heavens i recollect 
it is mr elliot himself 
no cried anne quickly it cannot be mr elliot i assure you 
he was to leave bath at nine this morning and does not come back 
till to morrow 
as she spoke she felt that captain wentworth was looking at her 
the consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her and made her regret 
that she had said so much simple as it was 
mary resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin 
began talking very warmly about the family features and protesting 
still more positively that it was mr elliot calling again upon anne 
to come and look for herself but anne did not mean to stir 
and tried to be cool and unconcerned her distress returned 
however on perceiving smiles and intelligent glances pass between 
two or three of the lady visitors as if they believed themselves 
quite in the secret it was evident that the report concerning her 
had spread and a short pause succeeded which seemed to ensure 
that it would now spread farther 
do come anne cried mary come and look yourself you will be too late 
if you do not make haste they are parting they are shaking hands 
he is turning away not know mr elliot indeed you seem to have 
forgot all about lyme 
to pacify mary and perhaps screen her own embarrassment 
anne did move quietly to the window she was just in time to ascertain 
that it really was mr elliot which she had never believed 
before he disappeared on one side as mrs clay walked quickly off 
on the other and checking the surprise which she could not but feel 
at such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons 
of totally opposite interest she calmly said yes it is mr elliot 
certainly he has changed his hour of going i suppose that is all 
or i may be mistaken i might not attend and walked back to her chair 
recomposed and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself well 
the visitors took their leave and charles having civilly seen them off 
and then made a face at them and abused them for coming began with 
well mother i have done something for you that you will like 
i have been to the theatre and secured a box for to morrow night 
a n t i a good boy i know you love a play and there is room for us all 
it holds nine i have engaged captain wentworth anne will 
not be sorry to join us i am sure we all like a play 
have not i done well mother 
mrs musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness 
for the play if henrietta and all the others liked it when mary 
eagerly interrupted her by exclaiming 
good heavens charles how can you think of such a thing 
take a box for to morrow night have you forgot that we are engaged 
to camden place to morrow night and that we were most particularly asked 
to meet lady dalrymple and her daughter and mr elliot and all 
the principal family connexions on purpose to be introduced to them 
how can you be so forgetful 
phoo phoo replied charles what is an evening party 
never worth remembering your father might have asked us to dinner 
i think if he had wanted to see us you may do as you like 
but i shall go to the play 
oh charles i declare it will be too abominable if you do 
when you promised to go 
no i did not promise i only smirked and bowed and said the word 
happy there was no promise 
but you must go charles it would be unpardonable to fail 
we were asked on purpose to be introduced there was always 
such a great connexion between the dalrymples and ourselves 
nothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately 
we are quite near relations you know and mr elliot too 
whom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with every attention 
is due to mr elliot consider my father s heir the future 
representative of the family 
do not talk to me about heirs and representatives cried charles 
i am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow 
to the rising sun if i would not go for the sake of your father 
i should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir 
what is mr elliot to me the careless expression was life to anne 
who saw that captain wentworth was all attention looking and 
listening with his whole soul and that the last words brought 
his enquiring eyes from charles to herself 
charles and mary still talked on in the same style he half serious 
and half jesting maintaining the scheme for the play and she 
invariably serious most warmly opposing it and not omitting 
to make it known that however determined to go to camden place herself 
she should not think herself very well used if they went to the play 
without her mrs musgrove interposed 
we had better put it off charles you had much better go back 
and change the box for tuesday it would be a pity to be divided 
and we should be losing miss anne too if there is a party at her father s 
and i am sure neither henrietta nor i should care at all for the play 
if miss anne could not be with us 
anne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness and quite as much 
so for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying 
if it depended only on my inclination madam the party at home 
excepting on mary s account would not be the smallest impediment 
i have no pleasure in the sort of meeting and should be too happy 
to change it for a play and with you but it had better 
not be attempted perhaps she had spoken it but she trembled 
when it was done conscious that her words were listened to 
and daring not even to try to observe their effect 
it was soon generally agreed that tuesday should be the day 
charles only reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife 
by persisting that he would go to the play to morrow if nobody else would 
captain wentworth left his seat and walked to the fire place 
probably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards 
and taking a station with less bare faced design by anne 
you have not been long enough in bath said he to enjoy 
the evening parties of the place 
oh no the usual character of them has nothing for me 
i am no card player 
you were not formerly i know you did not use to like cards 
but time makes many changes 
i am not yet so much changed cried anne and stopped fearing she 
hardly knew what misconstruction after waiting a few moments 
he said and as if it were the result of immediate feeling 
it is a period indeed eight years and a half is a period 
whether he would have proceeded farther was left to anne s imagination 
to ponder over in a calmer hour for while still hearing the sounds 
he had uttered she was startled to other subjects by henrietta 
eager to make use of the present leisure for getting out 
and calling on her companions to lose no time lest somebody else 
should come in 
they were obliged to move anne talked of being perfectly ready 
and tried to look it but she felt that could henrietta have known 
the regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair 
in preparing to quit the room she would have found in all her own 
sensations for her cousin in the very security of his affection 
wherewith to pity her 
their preparations however were stopped short alarming sounds 
were heard other visitors approached and the door was thrown open 
for sir walter and miss elliot whose entrance seemed to give 
a general chill anne felt an instant oppression and wherever she looked 
saw symptoms of the same the comfort the freedom the gaiety 
of the room was over hushed into cold composure determined silence 
or insipid talk to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister 
how mortifying to feel that it was so 
her jealous eye was satisfied in one particular captain wentworth 
was acknowledged again by each by elizabeth more graciously than before 
she even addressed him once and looked at him more than once 
elizabeth was in fact revolving a great measure the sequel 
explained it after the waste of a few minutes in saying 
the proper nothings she began to give the invitation which 
was to comprise all the remaining dues of the musgroves 
to morrow evening to meet a few friends no formal party 
it was all said very gracefully and the cards with which she had 
provided herself the miss elliot at home were laid on the table 
with a courteous comprehensive smile to all and one smile and 
one card more decidedly for captain wentworth the truth was 
that elizabeth had been long enough in bath to understand 
the importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his 
the past was nothing the present was that captain wentworth 
would move about well in her drawing room the card was pointedly given 
and sir walter and elizabeth arose and disappeared 
the interruption had been short though severe and ease and animation 
returned to most of those they left as the door shut them out 
but not to anne she could think only of the invitation she had 
with such astonishment witnessed and of the manner in which 
it had been received a manner of doubtful meaning of surprise rather 
than gratification of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance 
she knew him she saw disdain in his eye and could not venture to believe 
that he had determined to accept such an offering as an atonement 
for all the insolence of the past her spirits sank he held the card 
in his hand after they were gone as if deeply considering it 
only think of elizabeth s including everybody whispered mary 
very audibly i do not wonder captain wentworth is delighted 
you see he cannot put the card out of his hand 
anne caught his eye saw his cheeks glow and his mouth form itself 
into a momentary expression of contempt and turned away 
that she might neither see nor hear more to vex her 
the party separated the gentlemen had their own pursuits 
the ladies proceeded on their own business and they met no more while 
anne belonged to them she was earnestly begged to return and dine 
and give them all the rest of the day but her spirits had been 
so long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more 
and fit only for home where she might be sure of being as silent 
as she chose 
promising to be with them the whole of the following morning therefore 
she closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to camden place 
there to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements 
of elizabeth and mrs clay for the morrow s party the frequent enumeration 
of the persons invited and the continually improving detail of all 
the embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant 
of its kind in bath while harassing herself with the never ending 
question of whether captain wentworth would come or not they were 
reckoning him as certain but with her it was a gnawing solicitude 
never appeased for five minutes together she generally thought 
he would come because she generally thought he ought but it was a case 
which she could not so shape into any positive act of duty or discretion 
as inevitably to defy the suggestions of very opposite feelings 
she only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation 
to let mrs clay know that she had been seen with mr elliot 
three hours after his being supposed to be out of bath 
for having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview 
from the lady herself she determined to mention it and it seemed to her 
there was guilt in mrs clay s face as she listened it was transient 
cleared away in an instant but anne could imagine she read there 
the consciousness of having by some complication of mutual trick 
or some overbearing authority of his been obliged to attend 
perhaps for half an hour to his lectures and restrictions on her designs 
on sir walter she exclaimed however with a very tolerable 
imitation of nature 
oh dear very true only think miss elliot to my great surprise 
i met with mr elliot in bath street i was never more astonished 
he turned back and walked with me to the pump yard he had been prevented 
setting off for thornberry but i really forget by what 
for i was in a hurry and could not much attend and i can only answer 
for his being determined not to be delayed in his return 
he wanted to know how early he might be admitted to morrow 
he was full of to morrow and it is very evident that i have been 
full of it too ever since i entered the house and learnt the extension 
of your plan and all that had happened or my seeing him could never have 
gone so entirely out of my head 
chapter 
one day only had passed since anne s conversation with mrs smith 
but a keener interest had succeeded and she was now so little touched 
by mr elliot s conduct except by its effects in one quarter 
that it became a matter of course the next morning still to defer 
her explanatory visit in rivers street she had promised to be 
with the musgroves from breakfast to dinner her faith was plighted 
and mr elliot s character like the sultaness scheherazade s head 
must live another day 
she could not keep her appointment punctually however 
the weather was unfavourable and she had grieved over the rain 
on her friends account and felt it very much on her own 
before she was able to attempt the walk when she reached the white hart 
and made her way to the proper apartment she found herself 
neither arriving quite in time nor the first to arrive 
the party before her were mrs musgrove talking to mrs croft 
and captain harville to captain wentworth and she immediately heard 
that mary and henrietta too impatient to wait had gone out the moment 
it had cleared but would be back again soon and that the strictest 
injunctions had been left with mrs musgrove to keep her there 
till they returned she had only to submit sit down 
be outwardly composed and feel herself plunged at once 
in all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of 
tasting a little before the morning closed there was no delay 
no waste of time she was deep in the happiness of such misery 
or the misery of such happiness instantly two minutes after 
her entering the room captain wentworth said 
we will write the letter we were talking of harville now 
if you will give me materials 
materials were at hand on a separate table he went to it 
and nearly turning his back to them all was engrossed by writing 
mrs musgrove was giving mrs croft the history of her eldest 
daughter s engagement and just in that inconvenient tone of voice 
which was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper 
anne felt that she did not belong to the conversation and yet 
as captain harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk 
she could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars such as 
how mr musgrove and my brother hayter had met again and again 
to talk it over what my brother hayter had said one day 
and what mr musgrove had proposed the next and what had occurred 
to my sister hayter and what the young people had wished and what 
i said at first i never could consent to but was afterwards persuaded 
to think might do very well and a great deal in the same style 
of open hearted communication minutiae which even with every advantage 
of taste and delicacy which good mrs musgrove could not give 
could be properly interesting only to the principals mrs croft 
was attending with great good humour and whenever she spoke at all 
it was very sensibly anne hoped the gentlemen might each be 
too much self occupied to hear 
and so madam all these thing considered said mrs musgrove 
in her powerful whisper though we could have wished it different 
yet altogether we did not think it fair to stand out any longer 
for charles hayter was quite wild about it and henrietta was 
pretty near as bad and so we thought they had better marry at once 
and make the best of it as many others have done before them 
at any rate said i it will be better than a long engagement 
that is precisely what i was going to observe cried mrs croft 
i would rather have young people settle on a small income at once 
and have to struggle with a few difficulties together than be 
involved in a long engagement i always think that no mutual 
oh dear mrs croft cried mrs musgrove unable to let her 
finish her speech there is nothing i so abominate for young people 
as a long engagement it is what i always protested against 
for my children it is all very well i used to say for young people 
to be engaged if there is a certainty of their being able to marry 
in six months or even in twelve but a long engagement 
yes dear madam said mrs croft or an uncertain engagement 
an engagement which may be long to begin without knowing 
that at such a time there will be the means of marrying 
i hold to be very unsafe and unwise and what i think all parents 
should prevent as far as they can 
anne found an unexpected interest here she felt its application 
to herself felt it in a nervous thrill all over her and at the same 
moment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table 
captain wentworth s pen ceased to move his head was raised pausing 
listening and he turned round the next instant to give a look 
one quick conscious look at her 
the two ladies continued to talk to re urge the same admitted truths 
and enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of 
a contrary practice as had fallen within their observation 
but anne heard nothing distinctly it was only a buzz of words in her ear 
her mind was in confusion 
captain harville who had in truth been hearing none of it 
now left his seat and moved to a window and anne seeming to watch him 
though it was from thorough absence of mind became gradually sensible 
that he was inviting her to join him where he stood he looked at her 
with a smile and a little motion of the head which expressed 
come to me i have something to say and the unaffected 
easy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance 
than he really was strongly enforced the invitation she roused herself 
and went to him the window at which he stood was at the other end 
of the room from where the two ladies were sitting and though nearer 
to captain wentworth s table not very near as she joined him 
captain harville s countenance re assumed the serious thoughtful 
expression which seemed its natural character 
look here said he unfolding a parcel in his hand and displaying 
a small miniature painting do you know who that is 
certainly captain benwick 
yes and you may guess who it is for but in a deep tone 
it was not done for her miss elliot do you remember our 
walking together at lyme and grieving for him i little thought then 
but no matter this was drawn at the cape he met with 
a clever young german artist at the cape and in compliance with a promise 
to my poor sister sat to him and was bringing it home for her 
and i have now the charge of getting it properly set for another 
it was a commission to me but who else was there to employ 
i hope i can allow for him i am not sorry indeed to make it 
over to another he undertakes it looking towards captain wentworth 
he is writing about it now and with a quivering lip he wound up 
the whole by adding poor fanny she would not have forgotten him so soon 
no replied anne in a low feeling voice that i can easily believe 
it was not in her nature she doted on him 
it would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved 
captain harville smiled as much as to say do you claim that 
for your sex and she answered the question smiling also 
yes we certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us 
it is perhaps our fate rather than our merit we cannot help ourselves 
we live at home quiet confined and our feelings prey upon us 
you are forced on exertion you have always a profession pursuits 
business of some sort or other to take you back into the world immediately 
and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions 
granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men 
which however i do not think i shall grant it does not apply 
to benwick he has not been forced upon any exertion the peace 
turned him on shore at the very moment and he has been living with us 
in our little family circle ever since 
true said anne very true i did not recollect but what shall 
we say now captain harville if the change be not from 
outward circumstances it must be from within it must be nature 
man s nature which has done the business for captain benwick 
no no it is not man s nature i will not allow it to be more 
man s nature than woman s to be inconstant and forget those they do love 
or have loved i believe the reverse i believe in a true analogy 
between our bodily frames and our mental and that as our bodies are 
the strongest so are our feelings capable of bearing most rough usage 
and riding out the heaviest weather 
your feelings may be the strongest replied anne but the same spirit 
of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender 
man is more robust than woman but he is not longer lived 
which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments 
nay it would be too hard upon you if it were otherwise 
you have difficulties and privations and dangers enough to struggle with 
you are always labouring and toiling exposed to every risk and hardship 
your home country friends all quitted neither time nor health 
nor life to be called your own it would be hard indeed 
with a faltering voice if woman s feelings were to be 
added to all this 
we shall never agree upon this question captain harville 
was beginning to say when a slight noise called their attention 
to captain wentworth s hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room 
it was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down but anne was 
startled at finding him nearer than she had supposed and half inclined 
to suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been 
occupied by them striving to catch sounds which yet she did not think 
he could have caught 
have you finished your letter said captain harville 
not quite a few lines more i shall have done in five minutes 
there is no hurry on my side i am only ready whenever you are 
i am in very good anchorage here smiling at anne well supplied 
and want for nothing no hurry for a signal at all well miss elliot 
lowering his voice as i was saying we shall never agree 
i suppose upon this point no man and woman would probably 
but let me observe that all histories are against you all stories 
prose and verse if i had such a memory as benwick i could bring you 
fifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument and i do not think 
i ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say 
upon woman s inconstancy songs and proverbs all talk 
of woman s fickleness but perhaps you will say these were all 
written by men 
perhaps i shall yes yes if you please no reference to examples 
in books men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story 
education has been theirs in so much higher a degree the pen has 
been in their hands i will not allow books to prove anything 
but how shall we prove anything 
we never shall we never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point 
it is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof 
we each begin probably with a little bias towards our own sex 
and upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it 
which has occurred within our own circle many of which circumstances 
perhaps those very cases which strike us the most may be precisely such 
as cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence 
or in some respect saying what should not be said 
ah cried captain harville in a tone of strong feeling 
if i could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes 
a last look at his wife and children and watches the boat 
that he has sent them off in as long as it is in sight 
and then turns away and says god knows whether we ever meet again 
and then if i could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does 
see them again when coming back after a twelvemonth s absence 
perhaps and obliged to put into another port he calculates how soon 
it be possible to get them there pretending to deceive himself 
and saying they cannot be here till such a day but all the while 
hoping for them twelve hours sooner and seeing them arrive at last 
as if heaven had given them wings by many hours sooner still 
if i could explain to you all this and all that a man can bear and do 
and glories to do for the sake of these treasures of his existence 
i speak you know only of such men as have hearts pressing his own 
with emotion 
oh cried anne eagerly i hope i do justice to all that is felt by you 
and by those who resemble you god forbid that i should undervalue 
the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow creatures 
i should deserve utter contempt if i dared to suppose that true attachment 
and constancy were known only by woman no i believe you capable 
of everything great and good in your married lives i believe you equal 
to every important exertion and to every domestic forbearance 
so long as if i may be allowed the expression so long as you have 
an object i mean while the woman you love lives and lives for you 
all the privilege i claim for my own sex it is not a very enviable one 
you need not covet it is that of loving longest when existence 
or when hope is gone 
she could not immediately have uttered another sentence her heart 
was too full her breath too much oppressed 
you are a good soul cried captain harville putting his hand 
on her arm quite affectionately there is no quarrelling with you 
and when i think of benwick my tongue is tied 
their attention was called towards the others mrs croft was taking leave 
here frederick you and i part company i believe said she 
i am going home and you have an engagement with your friend 
to night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party 
turning to anne we had your sister s card yesterday 
and i understood frederick had a card too though i did not see it 
and you are disengaged frederick are you not as well as ourselves 
captain wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste and either 
could not or would not answer fully 
yes said he very true here we separate but harville and i 
shall soon be after you that is harville if you are ready 
i am in half a minute i know you will not be sorry to be off 
i shall be at your service in half a minute 
mrs croft left them and captain wentworth having sealed his letter 
with great rapidity was indeed ready and had even a hurried 
agitated air which shewed impatience to be gone anne knew not how 
to understand it she had the kindest good morning god bless you 
from captain harville but from him not a word nor a look 
he had passed out of the room without a look 
she had only time however to move closer to the table where 
he had been writing when footsteps were heard returning 
the door opened it was himself he begged their pardon 
but he had forgotten his gloves and instantly crossing the room 
to the writing table he drew out a letter from under the scattered paper 
placed it before anne with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on her 
for a time and hastily collecting his gloves was again out of the room 
almost before mrs musgrove was aware of his being in it 
the work of an instant 
the revolution which one instant had made in anne was almost 
beyond expression the letter with a direction hardly legible 
to miss a e was evidently the one which he had been folding 
so hastily while supposed to be writing only to captain benwick 
he had been also addressing her on the contents of that letter 
depended all which this world could do for her anything was possible 
anything might be defied rather than suspense mrs musgrove had 
little arrangements of her own at her own table to their protection 
she must trust and sinking into the chair which he had occupied 
succeeding to the very spot where he had leaned and written 
her eyes devoured the following words 
i can listen no longer in silence i must speak to you by such means 
as are within my reach you pierce my soul i am half agony 
half hope tell me not that i am too late that such precious feelings 
are gone for ever i offer myself to you again with a heart 
even more your own than when you almost broke it eight years 
and a half ago dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman 
that his love has an earlier death i have loved none but you 
unjust i may have been weak and resentful i have been 
but never inconstant you alone have brought me to bath 
for you alone i think and plan have you not seen this 
can you fail to have understood my wishes i had not waited even 
these ten days could i have read your feelings as i think you must have 
penetrated mine i can hardly write i am every instant hearing 
something which overpowers me you sink your voice but i can 
distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others 
too good too excellent creature you do us justice indeed 
you do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men 
believe it to be most fervent most undeviating in f w 
i must go uncertain of my fate but i shall return hither 
or follow your party as soon as possible a word a look 
will be enough to decide whether i enter your father s house 
this evening or never 
such a letter was not to be soon recovered from half and hour s solitude 
and reflection might have tranquillized her but the ten minutes only 
which now passed before she was interrupted with all the restraints 
of her situation could do nothing towards tranquillity every moment 
rather brought fresh agitation it was overpowering happiness 
and before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation 
charles mary and henrietta all came in 
the absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then 
an immediate struggle but after a while she could do no more 
she began not to understand a word they said and was obliged 
to plead indisposition and excuse herself they could then see 
that she looked very ill were shocked and concerned and would not 
stir without her for the world this was dreadful would they only 
have gone away and left her in the quiet possession of that room 
it would have been her cure but to have them all standing or 
waiting around her was distracting and in desperation 
she said she would go home 
by all means my dear cried mrs musgrove go home directly 
and take care of yourself that you may be fit for the evening 
i wish sarah was here to doctor you but i am no doctor myself 
charles ring and order a chair she must not walk 
but the chair would never do worse than all to lose the possibility 
of speaking two words to captain wentworth in the course of her quiet 
solitary progress up the town and she felt almost certain of meeting him 
could not be borne the chair was earnestly protested against 
and mrs musgrove who thought only of one sort of illness 
having assured herself with some anxiety that there had been no fall 
in the case that anne had not at any time lately slipped down 
and got a blow on her head that she was perfectly convinced of having 
had no fall could part with her cheerfully and depend on 
finding her better at night 
anxious to omit no possible precaution anne struggled and said 
i am afraid madam that it is not perfectly understood 
pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope 
to see your whole party this evening i am afraid there had been 
some mistake and i wish you particularly to assure captain harville 
and captain wentworth that we hope to see them both 
oh my dear it is quite understood i give you my word 
captain harville has no thought but of going 
do you think so but i am afraid and i should be so very sorry 
will you promise me to mention it when you see them again 
you will see them both this morning i dare say do promise me 
to be sure i will if you wish it charles if you see captain harville 
anywhere remember to give miss anne s message but indeed my dear 
you need not be uneasy captain harville holds himself quite engaged 
i will answer for it and captain wentworth the same i dare say 
anne could do no more but her heart prophesied some mischance 
to damp the perfection of her felicity it could not be very lasting 
however even if he did not come to camden place himself 
it would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence 
by captain harville another momentary vexation occurred 
charles in his real concern and good nature would go home with her 
there was no preventing him this was almost cruel but she could not 
be long ungrateful he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmith s 
to be of use to her and she set off with him with no feeling 
but gratitude apparent 
they were on union street when a quicker step behind a something 
of familiar sound gave her two moments preparation for the sight 
of captain wentworth he joined them but as if irresolute 
whether to join or to pass on said nothing only looked 
anne could command herself enough to receive that look 
and not repulsively the cheeks which had been pale now glowed 
and the movements which had hesitated were decided he walked by her side 
presently struck by a sudden thought charles said 
captain wentworth which way are you going only to gay street 
or farther up the town 
i hardly know replied captain wentworth surprised 
are you going as high as belmont are you going near camden place 
because if you are i shall have no scruple in asking you 
to take my place and give anne your arm to her father s door 
she is rather done for this morning and must not go so far without help 
and i ought to be at that fellow s in the market place 
he promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off 
said he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment 
that i might see it and if i do not turn back now i have no chance 
by his description a good deal like the second size double barrel of mine 
which you shot with one day round winthrop 
there could not be an objection there could be only the most 
proper alacrity a most obliging compliance for public view 
and smiles reined in and spirits dancing in private rapture 
in half a minute charles was at the bottom of union street again 
and the other two proceeding together and soon words enough had passed 
between them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet 
and retired gravel walk where the power of conversation would make 
the present hour a blessing indeed and prepare it for all 
the immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives 
could bestow there they exchanged again those feelings 
and those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything 
but which had been followed by so many many years of division 
and estrangement there they returned again into the past 
more exquisitely happy perhaps in their re union than when 
it had been first projected more tender more tried more fixed 
in a knowledge of each other s character truth and attachment 
more equal to act more justified in acting and there as they slowly 
paced the gradual ascent heedless of every group around them 
seeing neither sauntering politicians bustling housekeepers 
flirting girls nor nursery maids and children they could indulge in 
those retrospections and acknowledgements and especially in 
those explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment 
which were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest all the little 
variations of the last week were gone through and of yesterday 
and today there could scarcely be an end 
she had not mistaken him jealousy of mr elliot had been 
the retarding weight the doubt the torment that had begun to operate 
in the very hour of first meeting her in bath that had returned 
after a short suspension to ruin the concert and that had influenced him 
in everything he had said and done or omitted to say and do 
in the last four and twenty hours it had been gradually yielding 
to the better hopes which her looks or words or actions 
occasionally encouraged it had been vanquished at last by 
those sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked 
with captain harville and under the irresistible governance of which 
he had seized a sheet of paper and poured out his feelings 
of what he had then written nothing was to be retracted or qualified 
he persisted in having loved none but her she had never been supplanted 
he never even believed himself to see her equal thus much indeed 
he was obliged to acknowledge that he had been constant unconsciously 
nay unintentionally that he had meant to forget her and believed it 
to be done he had imagined himself indifferent when he had only 
been angry and he had been unjust to her merits because he had been 
a sufferer from them her character was now fixed on his mind 
as perfection itself maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude 
and gentleness but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at uppercross 
had he learnt to do her justice and only at lyme had he begun 
to understand himself at lyme he had received lessons 
of more than one sort the passing admiration of mr elliot 
had at least roused him and the scenes on the cobb and at 
captain harville s had fixed her superiority 
in his preceding attempts to attach himself to louisa musgrove 
the attempts of angry pride he protested that he had for ever 
felt it to be impossible that he had not cared could not care 
for louisa though till that day till the leisure for reflection 
which followed it he had not understood the perfect excellence 
of the mind with which louisa s could so ill bear a comparison 
or the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own 
there he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle 
and the obstinacy of self will between the darings of heedlessness 
and the resolution of a collected mind there he had seen everything 
to exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost and there begun 
to deplore the pride the folly the madness of resentment 
which had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way 
from that period his penance had become severe he had no sooner 
been free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days 
of louisa s accident no sooner begun to feel himself alive again 
than he had begun to feel himself though alive not at liberty 
i found said he that i was considered by harville an engaged man 
that neither harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our 
mutual attachment i was startled and shocked to a degree 
i could contradict this instantly but when i began to reflect 
that others might have felt the same her own family nay 
perhaps herself i was no longer at my own disposal i was hers in honour 
if she wished it i had been unguarded i had not thought seriously 
on this subject before i had not considered that my excessive intimacy 
must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways and that i had 
no right to be trying whether i could attach myself to either of the girls 
at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report were there no other 
ill effects i had been grossly wrong and must abide the consequences 
he found too late in short that he had entangled himself 
and that precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring 
for louisa at all he must regard himself as bound to her 
if her sentiments for him were what the harvilles supposed 
it determined him to leave lyme and await her complete recovery elsewhere 
he would gladly weaken by any fair means whatever feelings or 
speculations concerning him might exist and he went therefore 
to his brother s meaning after a while to return to kellynch 
and act as circumstances might require 
i was six weeks with edward said he and saw him happy 
i could have no other pleasure i deserved none he enquired after you 
very particularly asked even if you were personally altered 
little suspecting that to my eye you could never alter 
anne smiled and let it pass it was too pleasing a blunder 
for a reproach it is something for a woman to be assured 
in her eight and twentieth year that she has not lost one charm 
of earlier youth but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased 
to anne by comparing it with former words and feeling it to be 
the result not the because of a revival of his warm attachment 
he had remained in shropshire lamenting the blindness of his own pride 
and the blunders of his own calculations till at once released from louisa 
by the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her engagement 
with benwick 
here said he ended the worst of my state for now i could at least 
put myself in the way of happiness i could exert myself 
i could do something but to be waiting so long in inaction 
and waiting only for evil had been dreadful within the first 
five minutes i said i will be at bath on wednesday and i was 
was it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come and to arrive 
with some degree of hope you were single it was possible that 
you might retain the feelings of the past as i did and one encouragement 
happened to be mine i could never doubt that you would be loved and 
sought by others but i knew to a certainty that you had refused one man 
at least of better pretensions than myself and i could not help 
often saying was this for me 
their first meeting in milsom street afforded much to be said 
but the concert still more that evening seemed to be made up 
of exquisite moments the moment of her stepping forward 
in the octagon room to speak to him the moment of mr elliot s appearing 
and tearing her away and one or two subsequent moments 
marked by returning hope or increasing despondency were dwelt on 
with energy 
to see you cried he in the midst of those who could not be 
my well wishers to see your cousin close by you conversing and smiling 
and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match 
to consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope 
to influence you even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent 
to consider what powerful supports would be his was it not enough 
to make the fool of me which i appeared how could i look on 
without agony was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you 
was not the recollection of what had been the knowledge of her influence 
the indelible immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done 
was it not all against me 
you should have distinguished replied anne you should not have 
suspected me now the case is so different and my age is so different 
if i was wrong in yielding to persuasion once remember that 
it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety not of risk 
when i yielded i thought it was to duty but no duty could be called 
in aid here in marrying a man indifferent to me all risk 
would have been incurred and all duty violated 
perhaps i ought to have reasoned thus he replied but i could not 
i could not derive benefit from the late knowledge i had acquired 
of your character i could not bring it into play it was overwhelmed 
buried lost in those earlier feelings which i had been smarting under 
year after year i could think of you only as one who had yielded 
who had given me up who had been influenced by any one rather than by me 
i saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery 
i had no reason to believe her of less authority now the force of habit 
was to be added 
i should have thought said anne that my manner to yourself 
might have spared you much or all of this 
no no your manner might be only the ease which your engagement 
to another man would give i left you in this belief and yet 
i was determined to see you again my spirits rallied with the morning 
and i felt that i had still a motive for remaining here 
at last anne was at home again and happier than any one in that house 
could have conceived all the surprise and suspense and every other 
painful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation 
she re entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy 
in some momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last 
an interval of meditation serious and grateful was the best corrective 
of everything dangerous in such high wrought felicity and she went 
to her room and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness 
of her enjoyment 
the evening came the drawing rooms were lighted up the company assembled 
it was but a card party it was but a mixture of those who had 
never met before and those who met too often a commonplace business 
too numerous for intimacy too small for variety but anne had never found 
an evening shorter glowing and lovely in sensibility and happiness 
and more generally admired than she thought about or cared for 
she had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature around her 
mr elliot was there she avoided but she could pity him 
the wallises she had amusement in understanding them lady dalrymple 
and miss carteret they would soon be innoxious cousins to her 
she cared not for mrs clay and had nothing to blush for in 
the public manners of her father and sister with the musgroves 
there was the happy chat of perfect ease with captain harville 
the kind hearted intercourse of brother and sister with lady russell 
attempts at conversation which a delicious consciousness cut short 
with admiral and mrs croft everything of peculiar cordiality and 
fervent interest which the same consciousness sought to conceal 
and with captain wentworth some moments of communications 
continually occurring and always the hope of more and always 
the knowledge of his being there 
it was in one of these short meetings each apparently occupied 
in admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants that she said 
i have been thinking over the past and trying impartially 
to judge of the right and wrong i mean with regard to myself 
and i must believe that i was right much as i suffered from it 
that i was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom 
you will love better than you do now to me she was in the place 
of a parent do not mistake me however i am not saying 
that she did not err in her advice it was perhaps one of those cases 
in which advice is good or bad only as the event decides 
and for myself i certainly never should in any circumstance 
of tolerable similarity give such advice but i mean that i was right 
in submitting to her and that if i had done otherwise i should have 
suffered more in continuing the engagement than i did even in giving it up 
because i should have suffered in my conscience i have now 
as far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature nothing 
to reproach myself with and if i mistake not a strong sense of duty 
is no bad part of a woman s portion 
he looked at her looked at lady russell and looking again at her 
replied as if in cool deliberation 
not yet but there are hopes of her being forgiven in time 
i trust to being in charity with her soon but i too have been 
thinking over the past and a question has suggested itself 
whether there may not have been one person more my enemy 
even than that lady my own self tell me if when i returned 
to england in the year eight with a few thousand pounds 
and was posted into the laconia if i had then written to you 
would you have answered my letter would you in short 
have renewed the engagement then 
would i was all her answer but the accent was decisive enough 
good god he cried you would it is not that i did not think of it 
or desire it as what could alone crown all my other success 
but i was proud too proud to ask again i did not understand you 
i shut my eyes and would not understand you or do you justice 
this is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one 
sooner than myself six years of separation and suffering 
might have been spared it is a sort of pain too which is new to me 
i have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn 
every blessing that i enjoyed i have valued myself on honourable toils 
and just rewards like other great men under reverses he added 
with a smile i must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune 
i must learn to brook being happier than i deserve 
chapter 
who can be in doubt of what followed when any two young people 
take it into their heads to marry they are pretty sure by perseverance 
to carry their point be they ever so poor or ever so imprudent 
or ever so little likely to be necessary to each other s ultimate comfort 
this may be bad morality to conclude with but i believe it to be truth 
and if such parties succeed how should a captain wentworth and 
an anne elliot with the advantage of maturity of mind 
consciousness of right and one independent fortune between them 
fail of bearing down every opposition they might in fact 
have borne down a great deal more than they met with for there was 
little to distress them beyond the want of graciousness and warmth 
sir walter made no objection and elizabeth did nothing worse 
than look cold and unconcerned captain wentworth with five and twenty 
thousand pounds and as high in his profession as merit and activity 
could place him was no longer nobody he was now esteemed quite worthy 
to address the daughter of a foolish spendthrift baronet 
who had not had principle or sense enough to maintain himself 
in the situation in which providence had placed him and who could 
give his daughter at present but a small part of the share 
of ten thousand pounds which must be hers hereafter 
sir walter indeed though he had no affection for anne 
and no vanity flattered to make him really happy on the occasion 
was very far from thinking it a bad match for her on the contrary 
when he saw more of captain wentworth saw him repeatedly by daylight 
and eyed him well he was very much struck by his personal claims 
and felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced 
against her superiority of rank and all this assisted by 
his well sounding name enabled sir walter at last to prepare his pen 
with a very good grace for the insertion of the marriage 
in the volume of honour 
the only one among them whose opposition of feeling could excite 
any serious anxiety was lady russell anne knew that lady russell 
must be suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing mr elliot 
and be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with 
and do justice to captain wentworth this however was what 
lady russell had now to do she must learn to feel that she had 
been mistaken with regard to both that she had been unfairly influenced 
by appearances in each that because captain wentworth s manners 
had not suited her own ideas she had been too quick in suspecting them 
to indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity and that because 
mr elliot s manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety 
and correctness their general politeness and suavity she had been 
too quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct 
opinions and well regulated mind there was nothing less 
for lady russell to do than to admit that she had been 
pretty completely wrong and to take up a new set of opinions 
and of hopes 
there is a quickness of perception in some a nicety in the discernment 
of character a natural penetration in short which no experience 
in others can equal and lady russell had been less gifted 
in this part of understanding than her young friend but she was 
a very good woman and if her second object was to be sensible 
and well judging her first was to see anne happy she loved anne 
better than she loved her own abilities and when the awkwardness 
of the beginning was over found little hardship in attaching herself 
as a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other child 
of all the family mary was probably the one most immediately gratified 
by the circumstance it was creditable to have a sister married 
and she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental 
to the connexion by keeping anne with her in the autumn 
and as her own sister must be better than her husband s sisters 
it was very agreeable that captain wentworth should be a richer man than 
either captain benwick or charles hayter she had something to suffer 
perhaps when they came into contact again in seeing anne restored 
to the rights of seniority and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette 
but she had a future to look forward to of powerful consolation 
anne had no uppercross hall before her no landed estate 
no headship of a family and if they could but keep captain wentworth 
from being made a baronet she would not change situations with anne 
it would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfied 
with her situation for a change is not very probable there 
she had soon the mortification of seeing mr elliot withdraw 
and no one of proper condition has since presented himself to raise 
even the unfounded hopes which sunk with him 
the news of his cousins anne s engagement burst on mr elliot 
most unexpectedly it deranged his best plan of domestic happiness 
his best hope of keeping sir walter single by the watchfulness 
which a son in law s rights would have given but though discomfited 
and disappointed he could still do something for his own interest 
and his own enjoyment he soon quitted bath and on mrs clay s 
quitting it soon afterwards and being next heard of as established 
under his protection in london it was evident how double a game 
he had been playing and how determined he was to save himself 
from being cut out by one artful woman at least 
mrs clay s affections had overpowered her interest and she had sacrificed 
for the young man s sake the possibility of scheming longer 
for sir walter she has abilities however as well as affections 
and it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning or hers 
may finally carry the day whether after preventing her from being 
the wife of sir walter he may not be wheedled and caressed at last 
into making her the wife of sir william 
it cannot be doubted that sir walter and elizabeth were shocked 
and mortified by the loss of their companion and the discovery of 
their deception in her they had their great cousins to be sure 
to resort to for comfort but they must long feel that to flatter 
and follow others without being flattered and followed in turn 
is but a state of half enjoyment 
anne satisfied at a very early period of lady russell s meaning 
to love captain wentworth as she ought had no other alloy 
to the happiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness 
of having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value 
there she felt her own inferiority very keenly the disproportion 
in their fortune was nothing it did not give her a moment s regret 
but to have no family to receive and estimate him properly 
nothing of respectability of harmony of good will to offer 
in return for all the worth and all the prompt welcome which met her 
in his brothers and sisters was a source of as lively pain 
as her mind could well be sensible of under circumstances of otherwise 
strong felicity she had but two friends in the world to add to his list 
lady russell and mrs smith to those however he was very well disposed 
to attach himself lady russell in spite of all her former transgressions 
he could now value from his heart while he was not obliged to say 
that he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them 
he was ready to say almost everything else in her favour 
and as for mrs smith she had claims of various kinds to recommend her 
quickly and permanently 
her recent good offices by anne had been enough in themselves 
and their marriage instead of depriving her of one friend 
secured her two she was their earliest visitor in their settled life 
and captain wentworth by putting her in the way of recovering 
her husband s property in the west indies by writing for her 
acting for her and seeing her through all the petty difficulties 
of the case with the activity and exertion of a fearless man 
and a determined friend fully requited the services which 
she had rendered or ever meant to render to his wife 
mrs smith s enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement of income 
with some improvement of health and the acquisition of such friends 
to be often with for her cheerfulness and mental alacrity did not 
fail her and while these prime supplies of good remained she might have 
bid defiance even to greater accessions of worldly prosperity 
she might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy 
and yet be happy her spring of felicity was in the glow 
of her spirits as her friend anne s was in the warmth of her heart 
anne was tenderness itself and she had the full worth of it 
in captain wentworth s affection his profession was all that could ever 
make her friends wish that tenderness less the dread of a future war 
all that could dim her sunshine she gloried in being a sailor s wife 
but she must pay the tax of quick alarm for belonging to that profession 
which is if possible more distinguished in its domestic virtues 
than in its national importance

sense and sensibility by jane austen 
chapter 
the family of dashwood had long been settled in sussex 
their estate was large and their residence was at norland park 
in the centre of their property where for many generations 
they had lived in so respectable a manner as to engage 
the general good opinion of their surrounding acquaintance 
the late owner of this estate was a single man who lived 
to a very advanced age and who for many years of his life 
had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister 
but her death which happened ten years before his own 
produced a great alteration in his home for to supply 
her loss he invited and received into his house the family 
of his nephew mr henry dashwood the legal inheritor 
of the norland estate and the person to whom he intended 
to bequeath it in the society of his nephew and niece 
and their children the old gentleman s days were 
comfortably spent his attachment to them all increased 
the constant attention of mr and mrs henry dashwood 
to his wishes which proceeded not merely from interest 
but from goodness of heart gave him every degree of solid 
comfort which his age could receive and the cheerfulness 
of the children added a relish to his existence 
by a former marriage mr henry dashwood had one 
son by his present lady three daughters the son 
a steady respectable young man was amply provided 
for by the fortune of his mother which had been large 
and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age 
by his own marriage likewise which happened soon afterwards 
he added to his wealth to him therefore the succession 
to the norland estate was not so really important as to 
his sisters for their fortune independent of what might 
arise to them from their father s inheriting that property 
could be but small their mother had nothing and their 
father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal 
for the remaining moiety of his first wife s fortune was 
also secured to her child and he had only a life interest 
in it 
the old gentleman died his will was read and 
like almost every other will gave as much disappointment 
as pleasure he was neither so unjust nor so ungrateful 
as to leave his estate from his nephew but he left it to him 
on such terms as destroyed half the value of the bequest 
mr dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his 
wife and daughters than for himself or his son but to 
his son and his son s son a child of four years old 
it was secured in such a way as to leave to himself 
no power of providing for those who were most dear 
to him and who most needed a provision by any charge 
on the estate or by any sale of its valuable woods 
the whole was tied up for the benefit of this child who 
in occasional visits with his father and mother at norland 
had so far gained on the affections of his uncle 
by such attractions as are by no means unusual in children 
of two or three years old an imperfect articulation 
an earnest desire of having his own way many cunning tricks 
and a great deal of noise as to outweigh all the value 
of all the attention which for years he had received 
from his niece and her daughters he meant not to 
be unkind however and as a mark of his affection 
for the three girls he left them a thousand pounds a piece 
mr dashwood s disappointment was at first severe 
but his temper was cheerful and sanguine and he might 
reasonably hope to live many years and by living economically 
lay by a considerable sum from the produce of an estate 
already large and capable of almost immediate improvement 
but the fortune which had been so tardy in coming was his 
only one twelvemonth he survived his uncle no longer 
and ten thousand pounds including the late legacies 
was all that remained for his widow and daughters 
his son was sent for as soon as his danger was known 
and to him mr dashwood recommended with all the strength 
and urgency which illness could command the interest 
of his mother in law and sisters 
mr john dashwood had not the strong feelings of the 
rest of the family but he was affected by a recommendation 
of such a nature at such a time and he promised to do 
every thing in his power to make them comfortable 
his father was rendered easy by such an assurance 
and mr john dashwood had then leisure to consider how 
much there might prudently be in his power to do for them 
he was not an ill disposed young man unless to 
be rather cold hearted and rather selfish is to be 
ill disposed but he was in general well respected 
for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge 
of his ordinary duties had he married a more amiable woman 
he might have been made still more respectable than he 
was he might even have been made amiable himself for he 
was very young when he married and very fond of his wife 
but mrs john dashwood was a strong caricature of himself 
more narrow minded and selfish 
when he gave his promise to his father he meditated 
within himself to increase the fortunes of his sisters 
by the present of a thousand pounds a piece he then 
really thought himself equal to it the prospect of four 
thousand a year in addition to his present income 
besides the remaining half of his own mother s fortune 
warmed his heart and made him feel capable of generosity 
yes he would give them three thousand pounds it would 
be liberal and handsome it would be enough to make 
them completely easy three thousand pounds he could 
spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience 
he thought of it all day long and for many days successively 
and he did not repent 
no sooner was his father s funeral over than mrs john 
dashwood without sending any notice of her intention to her 
mother in law arrived with her child and their attendants 
no one could dispute her right to come the house was 
her husband s from the moment of his father s decease 
but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the greater 
and to a woman in mrs dashwood s situation with only 
common feelings must have been highly unpleasing 
but in her mind there was a sense of honor so keen 
a generosity so romantic that any offence of the kind 
by whomsoever given or received was to her a source 
of immoveable disgust mrs john dashwood had never 
been a favourite with any of her husband s family 
but she had had no opportunity till the present 
of shewing them with how little attention to the comfort 
of other people she could act when occasion required it 
so acutely did mrs dashwood feel this ungracious 
behaviour and so earnestly did she despise her 
daughter in law for it that on the arrival of the latter 
she would have quitted the house for ever had not the 
entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect 
on the propriety of going and her own tender love for all 
her three children determined her afterwards to stay 
and for their sakes avoid a breach with their brother 
elinor this eldest daughter whose advice was 
so effectual possessed a strength of understanding 
and coolness of judgment which qualified her 
though only nineteen to be the counsellor of her mother 
and enabled her frequently to counteract to the advantage 
of them all that eagerness of mind in mrs dashwood 
which must generally have led to imprudence she had 
an excellent heart her disposition was affectionate 
and her feelings were strong but she knew how to govern 
them it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn 
and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught 
marianne s abilities were in many respects 
quite equal to elinor s she was sensible and clever 
but eager in everything her sorrows her joys could have 
no moderation she was generous amiable interesting she 
was everything but prudent the resemblance between 
her and her mother was strikingly great 
elinor saw with concern the excess of her 
sister s sensibility but by mrs dashwood it was valued 
and cherished they encouraged each other now in the 
violence of their affliction the agony of grief 
which overpowered them at first was voluntarily renewed 
was sought for was created again and again they gave 
themselves up wholly to their sorrow seeking increase 
of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it 
and resolved against ever admitting consolation 
in future elinor too was deeply afflicted but still 
she could struggle she could exert herself she could 
consult with her brother could receive her sister in law 
on her arrival and treat her with proper attention 
and could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion 
and encourage her to similar forbearance 
margaret the other sister was a good humored 
well disposed girl but as she had already imbibed 
a good deal of marianne s romance without having 
much of her sense she did not at thirteen bid fair 
to equal her sisters at a more advanced period of life 
chapter 
mrs john dashwood now installed herself mistress 
of norland and her mother and sisters in law were degraded 
to the condition of visitors as such however they were 
treated by her with quiet civility and by her husband 
with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody 
beyond himself his wife and their child he really 
pressed them with some earnestness to consider norland 
as their home and as no plan appeared so eligible 
to mrs dashwood as remaining there till she could 
accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood 
his invitation was accepted 
a continuance in a place where everything reminded 
her of former delight was exactly what suited her mind 
in seasons of cheerfulness no temper could be more cheerful 
than hers or possess in a greater degree that sanguine 
expectation of happiness which is happiness itself 
but in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy 
and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was 
beyond alloy 
mrs john dashwood did not at all approve of what her 
husband intended to do for his sisters to take three 
thousand pounds from the fortune of their dear little boy 
would be impoverishing him to the most dreadful degree 
she begged him to think again on the subject how could 
he answer it to himself to rob his child and his only 
child too of so large a sum and what possible claim 
could the miss dashwoods who were related to him only by 
half blood which she considered as no relationship at all 
have on his generosity to so large an amount it was very 
well known that no affection was ever supposed to exist 
between the children of any man by different marriages 
and why was he to ruin himself and their poor little harry 
by giving away all his money to his half sisters 
it was my father s last request to me replied 
her husband that i should assist his widow and daughters 
he did not know what he was talking of i dare say 
ten to one but he was light headed at the time 
had he been in his right senses he could not have thought 
of such a thing as begging you to give away half your 
fortune from your own child 
he did not stipulate for any particular sum 
my dear fanny he only requested me in general terms 
to assist them and make their situation more comfortable 
than it was in his power to do perhaps it would 
have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself 
he could hardly suppose i should neglect them 
but as he required the promise i could not do less 
than give it at least i thought so at the time 
the promise therefore was given and must be performed 
something must be done for them whenever they leave norland 
and settle in a new home 
well then let something be done for them 
but that something need not be three thousand pounds 
consider she added that when the money is once 
parted with it never can return your sisters will marry 
and it will be gone for ever if indeed it could 
be restored to our poor little boy 
why to be sure said her husband very gravely 
that would make great difference the time may come when 
harry will regret that so large a sum was parted with 
if he should have a numerous family for instance it would 
be a very convenient addition 
to be sure it would 
perhaps then it would be better for all parties 
if the sum were diminished one half five hundred pounds 
would be a prodigious increase to their fortunes 
oh beyond anything great what brother on earth 
would do half so much for his sisters even if really 
his sisters and as it is only half blood but you 
have such a generous spirit 
i would not wish to do any thing mean he replied 
one had rather on such occasions do too much than 
too little no one at least can think i have not 
done enough for them even themselves they can hardly 
expect more 
there is no knowing what they may expect 
said the lady but we are not to think of their 
expectations the question is what you can afford to do 
certainly and i think i may afford to give them five 
hundred pounds a piece as it is without any addition 
of mine they will each have about three thousand pounds 
on their mother s death a very comfortable fortune 
for any young woman 
to be sure it is and indeed it strikes me that 
they can want no addition at all they will have ten 
thousand pounds divided amongst them if they marry 
they will be sure of doing well and if they do not 
they may all live very comfortably together on the interest 
of ten thousand pounds 
that is very true and therefore i do not know whether 
upon the whole it would not be more advisable to do 
something for their mother while she lives rather than 
for them something of the annuity kind i mean my sisters 
would feel the good effects of it as well as herself 
a hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable 
his wife hesitated a little however in giving 
her consent to this plan 
to be sure said she it is better than parting with 
fifteen hundred pounds at once but then if mrs dashwood 
should live fifteen years we shall be completely taken in 
fifteen years my dear fanny her life cannot 
be worth half that purchase 
certainly not but if you observe people always 
live for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them 
and she is very stout and healthy and hardly forty 
an annuity is a very serious business it comes over 
and over every year and there is no getting rid 
of it you are not aware of what you are doing 
i have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities 
for my mother was clogged with the payment of three 
to old superannuated servants by my father s will 
and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it 
twice every year these annuities were to be paid and then 
there was the trouble of getting it to them and then one 
of them was said to have died and afterwards it turned 
out to be no such thing my mother was quite sick of it 
her income was not her own she said with such perpetual 
claims on it and it was the more unkind in my father 
because otherwise the money would have been entirely at 
my mother s disposal without any restriction whatever 
it has given me such an abhorrence of annuities that i am 
sure i would not pin myself down to the payment of one for 
all the world 
it is certainly an unpleasant thing replied mr dashwood 
to have those kind of yearly drains on one s income 
one s fortune as your mother justly says is not one s own 
to be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum 
on every rent day is by no means desirable it takes away 
one s independence 
undoubtedly and after all you have no thanks for it 
they think themselves secure you do no more than what 
is expected and it raises no gratitude at all if i were you 
whatever i did should be done at my own discretion entirely 
i would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly 
it may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred 
or even fifty pounds from our own expenses 
i believe you are right my love it will be better 
that there should by no annuity in the case whatever i 
may give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance 
than a yearly allowance because they would only enlarge 
their style of living if they felt sure of a larger income 
and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end 
of the year it will certainly be much the best way 
a present of fifty pounds now and then will prevent 
their ever being distressed for money and will i think 
be amply discharging my promise to my father 
to be sure it will indeed to say the truth 
i am convinced within myself that your father had no idea 
of your giving them any money at all the assistance 
he thought of i dare say was only such as might be 
reasonably expected of you for instance such as looking 
out for a comfortable small house for them helping them 
to move their things and sending them presents of fish 
and game and so forth whenever they are in season 
i will lay my life that he meant nothing farther indeed 
it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did 
do but consider my dear mr dashwood how excessively 
comfortable your mother in law and her daughters may live 
on the interest of seven thousand pounds besides the 
thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls which brings 
them in fifty pounds a year a piece and of course 
they will pay their mother for their board out of it 
altogether they will have five hundred a year amongst them 
and what on earth can four women want for more than 
that they will live so cheap their housekeeping will 
be nothing at all they will have no carriage no horses 
and hardly any servants they will keep no company 
and can have no expenses of any kind only conceive 
how comfortable they will be five hundred a year i am 
sure i cannot imagine how they will spend half of it 
and as to your giving them more it is quite absurd to think 
of it they will be much more able to give you something 
upon my word said mr dashwood i believe you 
are perfectly right my father certainly could mean 
nothing more by his request to me than what you say 
i clearly understand it now and i will strictly fulfil 
my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness 
to them as you have described when my mother removes 
into another house my services shall be readily given 
to accommodate her as far as i can some little present 
of furniture too may be acceptable then 
certainly returned mrs john dashwood but however 
one thing must be considered when your father and mother 
moved to norland though the furniture of stanhill 
was sold all the china plate and linen was saved 
and is now left to your mother her house will therefore 
be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it 
that is a material consideration undoubtedly 
a valuable legacy indeed and yet some of the plate would 
have been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here 
yes and the set of breakfast china is twice 
as handsome as what belongs to this house a great 
deal too handsome in my opinion for any place they 
can ever afford to live in but however so it is 
your father thought only of them and i must say this 
that you owe no particular gratitude to him nor attention 
to his wishes for we very well know that if he could 
he would have left almost everything in the world to them 
this argument was irresistible it gave to his 
intentions whatever of decision was wanting before and he 
finally resolved that it would be absolutely unnecessary 
if not highly indecorous to do more for the widow 
and children of his father than such kind of neighbourly 
acts as his own wife pointed out 
chapter 
mrs dashwood remained at norland several months 
not from any disinclination to move when the sight of every 
well known spot ceased to raise the violent emotion which it 
produced for a while for when her spirits began to revive 
and her mind became capable of some other exertion than that 
of heightening its affliction by melancholy remembrances 
she was impatient to be gone and indefatigable in her inquiries 
for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of norland 
for to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible 
but she could hear of no situation that at once answered 
her notions of comfort and ease and suited the prudence 
of her eldest daughter whose steadier judgment rejected 
several houses as too large for their income which her 
mother would have approved 
mrs dashwood had been informed by her husband of the 
solemn promise on the part of his son in their favour 
which gave comfort to his last earthly reflections 
she doubted the sincerity of this assurance no more than he 
had doubted it himself and she thought of it for her daughters 
sake with satisfaction though as for herself she was 
persuaded that a much smaller provision than l would 
support her in affluence for their brother s sake too 
for the sake of his own heart she rejoiced and she 
reproached herself for being unjust to his merit before 
in believing him incapable of generosity his attentive 
behaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that 
their welfare was dear to him and for a long time 
she firmly relied on the liberality of his intentions 
the contempt which she had very early in their acquaintance 
felt for her daughter in law was very much increased 
by the farther knowledge of her character which half 
a year s residence in her family afforded and perhaps 
in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal 
affection on the side of the former the two ladies might 
have found it impossible to have lived together so long 
had not a particular circumstance occurred to give 
still greater eligibility according to the opinions 
of mrs dashwood to her daughters continuance at norland 
this circumstance was a growing attachment between 
her eldest girl and the brother of mrs john dashwood 
a gentleman like and pleasing young man who was introduced 
to their acquaintance soon after his sister s establishment 
at norland and who had since spent the greatest part 
of his time there 
some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from 
motives of interest for edward ferrars was the eldest son 
of a man who had died very rich and some might have repressed 
it from motives of prudence for except a trifling sum 
the whole of his fortune depended on the will of his mother 
but mrs dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either consideration 
it was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable 
that he loved her daughter and that elinor returned 
the partiality it was contrary to every doctrine of 
her s that difference of fortune should keep any couple 
asunder who were attracted by resemblance of disposition 
and that elinor s merit should not be acknowledged 
by every one who knew her was to her comprehension impossible 
edward ferrars was not recommended to their good 
opinion by any peculiar graces of person or address 
he was not handsome and his manners required intimacy 
to make them pleasing he was too diffident to do justice 
to himself but when his natural shyness was overcome 
his behaviour gave every indication of an open 
affectionate heart his understanding was good 
and his education had given it solid improvement 
but he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition 
to answer the wishes of his mother and sister who longed 
to see him distinguished as they hardly knew what 
they wanted him to make a fine figure in the world in some 
manner or other his mother wished to interest him in 
political concerns to get him into parliament or to see 
him connected with some of the great men of the day 
mrs john dashwood wished it likewise but in the mean while 
till one of these superior blessings could be attained it would 
have quieted her ambition to see him driving a barouche 
but edward had no turn for great men or barouches 
all his wishes centered in domestic comfort and the quiet 
of private life fortunately he had a younger brother 
who was more promising 
edward had been staying several weeks in the house 
before he engaged much of mrs dashwood s attention 
for she was at that time in such affliction as rendered 
her careless of surrounding objects she saw only that he 
was quiet and unobtrusive and she liked him for it 
he did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by 
ill timed conversation she was first called to observe 
and approve him farther by a reflection which elinor 
chanced one day to make on the difference between him 
and his sister it was a contrast which recommended him 
most forcibly to her mother 
it is enough said she to say that he is unlike 
fanny is enough it implies everything amiable 
i love him already 
i think you will like him said elinor when you 
know more of him 
like him replied her mother with a smile 
i feel no sentiment of approbation inferior to love 
you may esteem him 
i have never yet known what it was to separate 
esteem and love 
mrs dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him 
her manners were attaching and soon banished his reserve 
she speedily comprehended all his merits the persuasion 
of his regard for elinor perhaps assisted her penetration 
but she really felt assured of his worth and even that 
quietness of manner which militated against all her 
established ideas of what a young man s address ought to be 
was no longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be 
warm and his temper affectionate 
no sooner did she perceive any symptom of love 
in his behaviour to elinor than she considered their 
serious attachment as certain and looked forward 
to their marriage as rapidly approaching 
in a few months my dear marianne said she 
elinor will in all probability be settled for life 
we shall miss her but she will be happy 
oh mamma how shall we do without her 
my love it will be scarcely a separation 
we shall live within a few miles of each other and shall 
meet every day of our lives you will gain a brother 
a real affectionate brother i have the highest opinion 
in the world of edward s heart but you look grave 
marianne do you disapprove your sister s choice 
perhaps said marianne i may consider it 
with some surprise edward is very amiable and i love 
him tenderly but yet he is not the kind of young 
man there is something wanting his figure is not striking 
it has none of that grace which i should expect 
in the man who could seriously attach my sister 
his eyes want all that spirit that fire which at once 
announce virtue and intelligence and besides all this 
i am afraid mamma he has no real taste music seems 
scarcely to attract him and though he admires elinor s 
drawings very much it is not the admiration of a person 
who can understand their worth it is evident in spite of 
his frequent attention to her while she draws that in fact 
he knows nothing of the matter he admires as a lover 
not as a connoisseur to satisfy me those characters 
must be united i could not be happy with a man whose 
taste did not in every point coincide with my own 
he must enter into all my feelings the same books 
the same music must charm us both oh mama how spiritless 
how tame was edward s manner in reading to us last night 
i felt for my sister most severely yet she bore it 
with so much composure she seemed scarcely to notice it 
i could hardly keep my seat to hear those beautiful lines 
which have frequently almost driven me wild pronounced 
with such impenetrable calmness such dreadful indifference 
he would certainly have done more justice to 
simple and elegant prose i thought so at the time 
but you would give him cowper 
nay mamma if he is not to be animated by cowper 
but we must allow for difference of taste elinor has 
not my feelings and therefore she may overlook it and 
be happy with him but it would have broke my heart 
had i loved him to hear him read with so little sensibility 
mama the more i know of the world the more am i convinced 
that i shall never see a man whom i can really love 
i require so much he must have all edward s virtues 
and his person and manners must ornament his goodness 
with every possible charm 
remember my love that you are not seventeen 
it is yet too early in life to despair of such a happiness 
why should you be less fortunate than your mother in 
one circumstance only my marianne may your destiny be 
different from her s 
chapter 
what a pity it is elinor said marianne 
that edward should have no taste for drawing 
no taste for drawing replied elinor why should 
you think so he does not draw himself indeed but he has 
great pleasure in seeing the performances of other people 
and i assure you he is by no means deficient in natural taste 
though he has not had opportunities of improving it 
had he ever been in the way of learning i think he would 
have drawn very well he distrusts his own judgment 
in such matters so much that he is always unwilling 
to give his opinion on any picture but he has an innate 
propriety and simplicity of taste which in general 
direct him perfectly right 
marianne was afraid of offending and said no more 
on the subject but the kind of approbation which elinor 
described as excited in him by the drawings of other 
people was very far from that rapturous delight which 
in her opinion could alone be called taste yet though 
smiling within herself at the mistake she honoured 
her sister for that blind partiality to edward which produced it 
i hope marianne continued elinor you do not 
consider him as deficient in general taste indeed i think 
i may say that you cannot for your behaviour to him 
is perfectly cordial and if that were your opinion 
i am sure you could never be civil to him 
marianne hardly knew what to say she would 
not wound the feelings of her sister on any account 
and yet to say what she did not believe was impossible 
at length she replied 
do not be offended elinor if my praise of him 
is not in every thing equal to your sense of his merits 
i have not had so many opportunities of estimating the minuter 
propensities of his mind his inclinations and tastes 
as you have but i have the highest opinion in the world 
of his goodness and sense i think him every thing that is 
worthy and amiable 
i am sure replied elinor with a smile 
that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied 
with such commendation as that i do not perceive 
how you could express yourself more warmly 
marianne was rejoiced to find her sister so easily pleased 
of his sense and his goodness continued elinor 
no one can i think be in doubt who has seen him 
often enough to engage him in unreserved conversation 
the excellence of his understanding and his principles 
can be concealed only by that shyness which too often 
keeps him silent you know enough of him to do justice 
to his solid worth but of his minuter propensities 
as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances 
been kept more ignorant than myself he and i have 
been at times thrown a good deal together while you 
have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate 
principle by my mother i have seen a great deal of him 
have studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on 
subjects of literature and taste and upon the whole 
i venture to pronounce that his mind is well informed 
enjoyment of books exceedingly great his imagination lively 
his observation just and correct and his taste delicate 
and pure his abilities in every respect improve 
as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person 
at first sight his address is certainly not striking 
and his person can hardly be called handsome till the 
expression of his eyes which are uncommonly good 
and the general sweetness of his countenance is perceived 
at present i know him so well that i think him 
really handsome or at least almost so what say you 
marianne 
i shall very soon think him handsome elinor if i 
do not now when you tell me to love him as a brother 
i shall no more see imperfection in his face than i now do 
in his heart 
elinor started at this declaration and was sorry for 
the warmth she had been betrayed into in speaking of him 
she felt that edward stood very high in her opinion 
she believed the regard to be mutual but she required 
greater certainty of it to make marianne s conviction 
of their attachment agreeable to her she knew that 
what marianne and her mother conjectured one moment 
they believed the next that with them to wish was to hope 
and to hope was to expect she tried to explain the real 
state of the case to her sister 
i do not attempt to deny said she that i think 
very highly of him that i greatly esteem that i like him 
marianne here burst forth with indignation 
esteem him like him cold hearted elinor oh 
worse than cold hearted ashamed of being otherwise 
use those words again and i will leave the room this moment 
elinor could not help laughing excuse me 
said she and be assured that i meant no offence to you 
by speaking in so quiet a way of my own feelings 
believe them to be stronger than i have declared 
believe them in short to be such as his merit and the 
suspicion the hope of his affection for me may warrant 
without imprudence or folly but farther than this you must 
not believe i am by no means assured of his regard for me 
there are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful 
and till his sentiments are fully known you cannot wonder 
at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality 
by believing or calling it more than it is in my heart 
i feel little scarcely any doubt of his preference 
but there are other points to be considered besides 
his inclination he is very far from being independent 
what his mother really is we cannot know but from fanny s 
occasional mention of her conduct and opinions we have 
never been disposed to think her amiable and i am very 
much mistaken if edward is not himself aware that there 
would be many difficulties in his way if he were to wish 
to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or 
high rank 
marianne was astonished to find how much the imagination 
of her mother and herself had outstripped the truth 
and you really are not engaged to him said she 
yet it certainly soon will happen but two advantages 
will proceed from this delay i shall not lose you so soon 
and edward will have greater opportunity of improving 
that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must 
be so indispensably necessary to your future felicity 
oh if he should be so far stimulated by your genius as to 
learn to draw himself how delightful it would be 
elinor had given her real opinion to her sister 
she could not consider her partiality for edward 
in so prosperous a state as marianne had believed it 
there was at times a want of spirits about him which 
if it did not denote indifference spoke of something almost 
as unpromising a doubt of her regard supposing him 
to feel it need not give him more than inquietude 
it would not be likely to produce that dejection of mind 
which frequently attended him a more reasonable because 
might be found in the dependent situation which forbade 
the indulgence of his affection she knew that his mother 
neither behaved to him so as to make his home comfortable 
at present nor to give him any assurance that he might form 
a home for himself without strictly attending to her views 
for his aggrandizement with such a knowledge as this 
it was impossible for elinor to feel easy on the subject 
she was far from depending on that result of his preference 
of her which her mother and sister still considered 
as certain nay the longer they were together the more 
doubtful seemed the nature of his regard and sometimes 
for a few painful minutes she believed it to be no more 
than friendship 
but whatever might really be its limits it was enough 
when perceived by his sister to make her uneasy 
and at the same time which was still more common 
to make her uncivil she took the first opportunity of 
affronting her mother in law on the occasion talking to 
her so expressively of her brother s great expectations 
of mrs ferrars s resolution that both her sons should 
marry well and of the danger attending any young woman 
who attempted to draw him in that mrs dashwood could 
neither pretend to be unconscious nor endeavor to be calm 
she gave her an answer which marked her contempt 
and instantly left the room resolving that whatever might 
be the inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal 
her beloved elinor should not be exposed another week 
to such insinuations 
in this state of her spirits a letter was delivered 
to her from the post which contained a proposal 
particularly well timed it was the offer of a small house 
on very easy terms belonging to a relation of her own 
a gentleman of consequence and property in devonshire 
the letter was from this gentleman himself and written 
in the true spirit of friendly accommodation 
he understood that she was in need of a dwelling 
and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage 
he assured her that everything should be done to it which 
she might think necessary if the situation pleased her 
he earnestly pressed her after giving the particulars 
of the house and garden to come with her daughters to 
barton park the place of his own residence from whence 
she might judge herself whether barton cottage for the 
houses were in the same parish could by any alteration 
be made comfortable to her he seemed really anxious to 
accommodate them and the whole of his letter was written 
in so friendly a style as could not fail of giving pleasure 
to his cousin more especially at a moment when she was 
suffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her 
nearer connections she needed no time for deliberation 
or inquiry her resolution was formed as she read 
the situation of barton in a county so far distant from 
sussex as devonshire which but a few hours before 
would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every 
possible advantage belonging to the place was now its 
first recommendation to quit the neighbourhood of norland 
was no longer an evil it was an object of desire 
it was a blessing in comparison of the misery of continuing 
her daughter in law s guest and to remove for ever 
from that beloved place would be less painful than to 
inhabit or visit it while such a woman was its mistress 
she instantly wrote sir john middleton her acknowledgment 
of his kindness and her acceptance of his proposal 
and then hastened to shew both letters to her daughters 
that she might be secure of their approbation before her 
answer were sent 
elinor had always thought it would be more prudent 
for them to settle at some distance from norland 
than immediately amongst their present acquaintance 
on that head therefore it was not for her to oppose 
her mother s intention of removing into devonshire 
the house too as described by sir john was on so 
simple a scale and the rent so uncommonly moderate 
as to leave her no right of objection on either point 
and therefore though it was not a plan which brought 
any charm to her fancy though it was a removal from 
the vicinity of norland beyond her wishes she made 
no attempt to dissuade her mother from sending a letter 
of acquiescence 
chapter 
no sooner was her answer dispatched than mrs dashwood 
indulged herself in the pleasure of announcing to her 
son in law and his wife that she was provided with a house 
and should incommode them no longer than till every thing were 
ready for her inhabiting it they heard her with surprise 
mrs john dashwood said nothing but her husband civilly 
hoped that she would not be settled far from norland 
she had great satisfaction in replying that she was going 
into devonshire edward turned hastily towards her 
on hearing this and in a voice of surprise and concern 
which required no explanation to her repeated 
devonshire are you indeed going there so far from hence 
and to what part of it she explained the situation 
it was within four miles northward of exeter 
it is but a cottage she continued but i hope 
to see many of my friends in it a room or two can 
easily be added and if my friends find no difficulty 
in travelling so far to see me i am sure i will find 
none in accommodating them 
she concluded with a very kind invitation to 
mr and mrs john dashwood to visit her at barton 
and to edward she gave one with still greater affection 
though her late conversation with her daughter in law had 
made her resolve on remaining at norland no longer than 
was unavoidable it had not produced the smallest effect 
on her in that point to which it principally tended 
to separate edward and elinor was as far from being her 
object as ever and she wished to show mrs john dashwood 
by this pointed invitation to her brother how totally she 
disregarded her disapprobation of the match 
mr john dashwood told his mother again and again 
how exceedingly sorry he was that she had taken a house at 
such a distance from norland as to prevent his being of any 
service to her in removing her furniture he really felt 
conscientiously vexed on the occasion for the very exertion 
to which he had limited the performance of his promise to 
his father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable 
the furniture was all sent around by water it chiefly 
consisted of household linen plate china and books 
with a handsome pianoforte of marianne s mrs john 
dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh she could 
not help feeling it hard that as mrs dashwood s income 
would be so trifling in comparison with their own 
she should have any handsome article of furniture 
mrs dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth it was 
ready furnished and she might have immediate possession 
no difficulty arose on either side in the agreement and she 
waited only for the disposal of her effects at norland 
and to determine her future household before she set 
off for the west and this as she was exceedingly rapid 
in the performance of everything that interested her 
was soon done the horses which were left her by her husband 
had been sold soon after his death and an opportunity 
now offering of disposing of her carriage she agreed 
to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her 
eldest daughter for the comfort of her children had she 
consulted only her own wishes she would have kept it 
but the discretion of elinor prevailed her wisdom 
too limited the number of their servants to three 
two maids and a man with whom they were speedily provided 
from amongst those who had formed their establishment 
at norland 
the man and one of the maids were sent off immediately 
into devonshire to prepare the house for their mistress s 
arrival for as lady middleton was entirely unknown 
to mrs dashwood she preferred going directly to the 
cottage to being a visitor at barton park and she relied 
so undoubtingly on sir john s description of the house 
as to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she 
entered it as her own her eagerness to be gone from norland 
was preserved from diminution by the evident satisfaction 
of her daughter in law in the prospect of her removal 
a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed 
under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure 
now was the time when her son in law s promise to his 
father might with particular propriety be fulfilled 
since he had neglected to do it on first coming to 
the estate their quitting his house might be looked 
on as the most suitable period for its accomplishment 
but mrs dashwood began shortly to give over every 
hope of the kind and to be convinced from the general 
drift of his discourse that his assistance extended no 
farther than their maintenance for six months at norland 
he so frequently talked of the increasing expenses 
of housekeeping and of the perpetual demands upon his purse 
which a man of any consequence in the world was beyond 
calculation exposed to that he seemed rather to stand 
in need of more money himself than to have any design of 
giving money away 
in a very few weeks from the day which brought sir 
john middleton s first letter to norland every thing was 
so far settled in their future abode as to enable 
mrs dashwood and her daughters to begin their journey 
many were the tears she would by them in their last 
adieus to a place so much beloved dear dear norland 
said marianne as she wandered alone before the house 
on the last evening of their being there when shall i cease 
to regret you when learn to feel a home elsewhere oh 
happy house could you know what i suffer in now viewing 
you from this spot from whence perhaps i may view 
you no more and you ye well known trees but you 
will continue the same no leaf will decay because we 
are removed nor any branch become motionless although we 
can observe you no longer no you will continue the same 
unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you occasion 
and insensible of any change in those who walk under your 
shade but who will remain to enjoy you 
chapter 
the first part of their journey was performed in too 
melancholy a disposition to be otherwise than tedious 
and unpleasant but as they drew towards the end of it 
their interest in the appearance of a country which they 
were to inhabit overcame their dejection and a view of 
barton valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness 
it was a pleasant fertile spot well wooded and rich 
in pasture after winding along it for more than a mile 
they reached their own house a small green court was 
the whole of its demesne in front and a neat wicket gate 
admitted them into it 
as a house barton cottage though small was comfortable 
and compact but as a cottage it was defective for the 
building was regular the roof was tiled the window 
shutters were not painted green nor were the walls covered 
with honeysuckles a narrow passage led directly through 
the house into the garden behind on each side of the 
entrance was a sitting room about sixteen feet square 
and beyond them were the offices and the stairs 
four bed rooms and two garrets formed the rest of the house 
it had not been built many years and was in good repair 
in comparison of norland it was poor and small indeed but 
the tears which recollection called forth as they entered 
the house were soon dried away they were cheered 
by the joy of the servants on their arrival and each 
for the sake of the others resolved to appear happy 
it was very early in september the season was fine 
and from first seeing the place under the advantage 
of good weather they received an impression in its 
favour which was of material service in recommending 
it to their lasting approbation 
the situation of the house was good high hills rose 
immediately behind and at no great distance on each side 
some of which were open downs the others cultivated and woody 
the village of barton was chiefly on one of these hills 
and formed a pleasant view from the cottage windows 
the prospect in front was more extensive it commanded the 
whole of the valley and reached into the country beyond 
the hills which surrounded the cottage terminated 
the valley in that direction under another name 
and in another course it branched out again between two 
of the steepest of them 
with the size and furniture of the house mrs dashwood 
was upon the whole well satisfied for though her former 
style of life rendered many additions to the latter 
indispensable yet to add and improve was a delight to her 
and she had at this time ready money enough to supply all 
that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments 
as for the house itself to be sure said she it is 
too small for our family but we will make ourselves 
tolerably comfortable for the present as it is too late 
in the year for improvements perhaps in the spring 
if i have plenty of money as i dare say i shall we may 
think about building these parlors are both too small 
for such parties of our friends as i hope to see often 
collected here and i have some thoughts of throwing the 
passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other 
and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance 
this with a new drawing room which may be easily added 
and a bed chamber and garret above will make it a very snug 
little cottage i could wish the stairs were handsome 
but one must not expect every thing though i suppose it 
would be no difficult matter to widen them i shall see 
how much i am before hand with the world in the spring 
and we will plan our improvements accordingly 
in the mean time till all these alterations could 
be made from the savings of an income of five hundred 
a year by a woman who never saved in her life they were 
wise enough to be contented with the house as it was 
and each of them was busy in arranging their particular 
concerns and endeavoring by placing around them books 
and other possessions to form themselves a home 
marianne s pianoforte was unpacked and properly disposed of 
and elinor s drawings were affixed to the walls of their 
sitting room 
in such employments as these they were interrupted 
soon after breakfast the next day by the entrance of 
their landlord who called to welcome them to barton 
and to offer them every accommodation from his own house 
and garden in which theirs might at present be deficient 
sir john middleton was a good looking man about forty 
he had formerly visited at stanhill but it was too long 
for his young cousins to remember him his countenance 
was thoroughly good humoured and his manners were 
as friendly as the style of his letter their arrival 
seemed to afford him real satisfaction and their comfort 
to be an object of real solicitude to him he said much 
of his earnest desire of their living in the most sociable 
terms with his family and pressed them so cordially 
to dine at barton park every day till they were better 
settled at home that though his entreaties were carried 
to a point of perseverance beyond civility they could 
not give offence his kindness was not confined to words 
for within an hour after he left them a large basket 
full of garden stuff and fruit arrived from the park 
which was followed before the end of the day by a present 
of game he insisted moreover on conveying all their 
letters to and from the post for them and would not be 
denied the satisfaction of sending them his newspaper 
every day 
lady middleton had sent a very civil message by him 
denoting her intention of waiting on mrs dashwood as soon as 
she could be assured that her visit would be no inconvenience 
and as this message was answered by an invitation 
equally polite her ladyship was introduced to them the next day 
they were of course very anxious to see a person on 
whom so much of their comfort at barton must depend and the 
elegance of her appearance was favourable to their wishes 
lady middleton was not more than six or seven and twenty 
her face was handsome her figure tall and striking 
and her address graceful her manners had all the elegance 
which her husband s wanted but they would have been 
improved by some share of his frankness and warmth 
and her visit was long enough to detract something from 
their first admiration by shewing that though perfectly 
well bred she was reserved cold and had nothing to say 
for herself beyond the most common place inquiry or remark 
conversation however was not wanted for sir john 
was very chatty and lady middleton had taken the wise 
precaution of bringing with her their eldest child a fine 
little boy about six years old by which means there was 
one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case 
of extremity for they had to enquire his name and age 
admire his beauty and ask him questions which his mother 
answered for him while he hung about her and held 
down his head to the great surprise of her ladyship 
who wondered at his being so shy before company as he 
could make noise enough at home on every formal visit 
a child ought to be of the party by way of provision 
for discourse in the present case it took up ten minutes 
to determine whether the boy were most like his father 
or mother and in what particular he resembled either 
for of course every body differed and every body was 
astonished at the opinion of the others 
an opportunity was soon to be given to the dashwoods 
of debating on the rest of the children as sir john 
would not leave the house without securing their promise 
of dining at the park the next day 
chapter 
barton park was about half a mile from the cottage 
the ladies had passed near it in their way along the valley 
but it was screened from their view at home by the 
projection of a hill the house was large and handsome 
and the middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality 
and elegance the former was for sir john s gratification 
the latter for that of his lady they were scarcely 
ever without some friends staying with them in the house 
and they kept more company of every kind than any other 
family in the neighbourhood it was necessary to the 
happiness of both for however dissimilar in temper 
and outward behaviour they strongly resembled each other 
in that total want of talent and taste which confined 
their employments unconnected with such as society produced 
within a very narrow compass sir john was a sportsman 
lady middleton a mother he hunted and shot and she 
humoured her children and these were their only resources 
lady middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her 
children all the year round while sir john s independent 
employments were in existence only half the time 
continual engagements at home and abroad however 
supplied all the deficiencies of nature and education 
supported the good spirits of sir john and gave exercise 
to the good breeding of his wife 
lady middleton piqued herself upon the elegance 
of her table and of all her domestic arrangements 
and from this kind of vanity was her greatest enjoyment 
in any of their parties but sir john s satisfaction 
in society was much more real he delighted in collecting 
about him more young people than his house would hold 
and the noisier they were the better was he pleased 
he was a blessing to all the juvenile part of the neighbourhood 
for in summer he was for ever forming parties to eat cold 
ham and chicken out of doors and in winter his private 
balls were numerous enough for any young lady who was not 
suffering under the unsatiable appetite of fifteen 
the arrival of a new family in the country was always 
a matter of joy to him and in every point of view he was 
charmed with the inhabitants he had now procured for his 
cottage at barton the miss dashwoods were young pretty 
and unaffected it was enough to secure his good opinion 
for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could 
want to make her mind as captivating as her person 
the friendliness of his disposition made him happy in 
accommodating those whose situation might be considered 
in comparison with the past as unfortunate in showing 
kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction 
of a good heart and in settling a family of females only 
in his cottage he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman 
for a sportsman though he esteems only those of his sex who 
are sportsmen likewise is not often desirous of encouraging 
their taste by admitting them to a residence within his own 
manor 
mrs dashwood and her daughters were met at the door 
of the house by sir john who welcomed them to barton 
park with unaffected sincerity and as he attended them 
to the drawing room repeated to the young ladies the concern 
which the same subject had drawn from him the day before 
at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them 
they would see he said only one gentleman there 
besides himself a particular friend who was staying at 
the park but who was neither very young nor very gay 
he hoped they would all excuse the smallness of the party 
and could assure them it should never happen so again 
he had been to several families that morning in hopes 
of procuring some addition to their number but it 
was moonlight and every body was full of engagements 
luckily lady middleton s mother had arrived at barton 
within the last hour and as she was a very cheerful 
agreeable woman he hoped the young ladies would not find 
it so very dull as they might imagine the young ladies 
as well as their mother were perfectly satisfied with 
having two entire strangers of the party and wished for 
no more 
mrs jennings lady middleton s mother was a 
good humoured merry fat elderly woman who talked a 
great deal seemed very happy and rather vulgar she was full 
of jokes and laughter and before dinner was over had said 
many witty things on the subject of lovers and husbands 
hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in sussex 
and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not 
marianne was vexed at it for her sister s sake and turned 
her eyes towards elinor to see how she bore these attacks 
with an earnestness which gave elinor far more pain than 
could arise from such common place raillery as mrs jennings s 
colonel brandon the friend of sir john seemed no 
more adapted by resemblance of manner to be his friend 
than lady middleton was to be his wife or mrs jennings 
to be lady middleton s mother he was silent and grave 
his appearance however was not unpleasing in spite 
of his being in the opinion of marianne and margaret 
an absolute old bachelor for he was on the wrong side 
of five and thirty but though his face was not handsome 
his countenance was sensible and his address was 
particularly gentlemanlike 
there was nothing in any of the party which could 
recommend them as companions to the dashwoods but the cold 
insipidity of lady middleton was so particularly repulsive 
that in comparison of it the gravity of colonel brandon 
and even the boisterous mirth of sir john and his 
mother in law was interesting lady middleton seemed 
to be roused to enjoyment only by the entrance of her 
four noisy children after dinner who pulled her about 
tore her clothes and put an end to every kind of discourse 
except what related to themselves 
in the evening as marianne was discovered to be musical 
she was invited to play the instrument was unlocked 
every body prepared to be charmed and marianne 
who sang very well at their request went through the 
chief of the songs which lady middleton had brought into 
the family on her marriage and which perhaps had lain 
ever since in the same position on the pianoforte 
for her ladyship had celebrated that event by giving 
up music although by her mother s account she had 
played extremely well and by her own was very fond of it 
marianne s performance was highly applauded 
sir john was loud in his admiration at the end of every song 
and as loud in his conversation with the others while every 
song lasted lady middleton frequently called him to order 
wondered how any one s attention could be diverted from music 
for a moment and asked marianne to sing a particular song 
which marianne had just finished colonel brandon alone 
of all the party heard her without being in raptures 
he paid her only the compliment of attention and she felt 
a respect for him on the occasion which the others had 
reasonably forfeited by their shameless want of taste 
his pleasure in music though it amounted not to that 
ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own 
was estimable when contrasted against the horrible 
insensibility of the others and she was reasonable enough 
to allow that a man of five and thirty might well have 
outlived all acuteness of feeling and every exquisite 
power of enjoyment she was perfectly disposed to make 
every allowance for the colonel s advanced state of life 
which humanity required 
chapter 
mrs jennings was a widow with an ample jointure 
she had only two daughters both of whom she had lived 
to see respectably married and she had now therefore 
nothing to do but to marry all the rest of the world 
in the promotion of this object she was zealously active 
as far as her ability reached and missed no opportunity 
of projecting weddings among all the young people 
of her acquaintance she was remarkably quick in the 
discovery of attachments and had enjoyed the advantage 
of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young 
lady by insinuations of her power over such a young man 
and this kind of discernment enabled her soon after her 
arrival at barton decisively to pronounce that colonel 
brandon was very much in love with marianne dashwood 
she rather suspected it to be so on the very first 
evening of their being together from his listening 
so attentively while she sang to them and when the visit 
was returned by the middletons dining at the cottage 
the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again 
it must be so she was perfectly convinced of it 
it would be an excellent match for he was rich and she 
was handsome mrs jennings had been anxious to see 
colonel brandon well married ever since her connection 
with sir john first brought him to her knowledge 
and she was always anxious to get a good husband for every 
pretty girl 
the immediate advantage to herself was by no means 
inconsiderable for it supplied her with endless jokes 
against them both at the park she laughed at the colonel 
and in the cottage at marianne to the former her 
raillery was probably as far as it regarded only himself 
perfectly indifferent but to the latter it was at 
first incomprehensible and when its object was understood 
she hardly knew whether most to laugh at its absurdity 
or censure its impertinence for she considered it as an 
unfeeling reflection on the colonel s advanced years 
and on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor 
mrs dashwood who could not think a man five years 
younger than herself so exceedingly ancient as he appeared 
to the youthful fancy of her daughter ventured to clear 
mrs jennings from the probability of wishing to throw 
ridicule on his age 
but at least mamma you cannot deny the absurdity 
of the accusation though you may not think it intentionally 
ill natured colonel brandon is certainly younger than 
mrs jennings but he is old enough to be my father 
and if he were ever animated enough to be in love 
must have long outlived every sensation of the kind 
it is too ridiculous when is a man to be safe from such wit 
if age and infirmity will not protect him 
infirmity said elinor do you call colonel brandon 
infirm i can easily suppose that his age may appear much 
greater to you than to my mother but you can hardly 
deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs 
did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism 
and is not that the commonest infirmity of declining life 
my dearest child said her mother laughing 
at this rate you must be in continual terror of my decay 
and it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been 
extended to the advanced age of forty 
mamma you are not doing me justice i know very well 
that colonel brandon is not old enough to make his friends 
yet apprehensive of losing him in the course of nature 
he may live twenty years longer but thirty five has 
nothing to do with matrimony 
perhaps said elinor thirty five and seventeen had 
better not have any thing to do with matrimony together 
but if there should by any chance happen to be a woman 
who is single at seven and twenty i should not think 
colonel brandon s being thirty five any objection to his 
marrying her 
a woman of seven and twenty said marianne 
after pausing a moment can never hope to feel or inspire 
affection again and if her home be uncomfortable 
or her fortune small i can suppose that she might 
bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse 
for the sake of the provision and security of a wife 
in his marrying such a woman therefore there would be 
nothing unsuitable it would be a compact of convenience 
and the world would be satisfied in my eyes it would 
be no marriage at all but that would be nothing 
to me it would seem only a commercial exchange in which 
each wished to be benefited at the expense of the other 
it would be impossible i know replied elinor 
to convince you that a woman of seven and twenty could 
feel for a man of thirty five anything near enough 
to love to make him a desirable companion to her 
but i must object to your dooming colonel brandon and 
his wife to the constant confinement of a sick chamber 
merely because he chanced to complain yesterday a 
very cold damp day of a slight rheumatic feel in one 
of his shoulders 
but he talked of flannel waistcoats said marianne 
and with me a flannel waistcoat is invariably connected 
with aches cramps rheumatisms and every species of 
ailment that can afflict the old and the feeble 
had he been only in a violent fever you would not 
have despised him half so much confess marianne is not 
there something interesting to you in the flushed cheek 
hollow eye and quick pulse of a fever 
soon after this upon elinor s leaving the room 
mamma said marianne i have an alarm on the subject 
of illness which i cannot conceal from you i am sure 
edward ferrars is not well we have now been here almost 
a fortnight and yet he does not come nothing but real 
indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay 
what else can detain him at norland 
had you any idea of his coming so soon 
said mrs dashwood i had none on the contrary 
if i have felt any anxiety at all on the subject it has 
been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want 
of pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation 
when i talked of his coming to barton does elinor 
expect him already 
i have never mentioned it to her but of course 
she must 
i rather think you are mistaken for when i 
was talking to her yesterday of getting a new grate 
for the spare bedchamber she observed that there 
was no immediate hurry for it as it was not likely 
that the room would be wanted for some time 
how strange this is what can be the meaning of it 
but the whole of their behaviour to each other has been 
unaccountable how cold how composed were their last 
adieus how languid their conversation the last evening 
of their being together in edward s farewell there was no 
distinction between elinor and me it was the good wishes 
of an affectionate brother to both twice did i leave 
them purposely together in the course of the last morning 
and each time did he most unaccountably follow me out 
of the room and elinor in quitting norland and edward 
cried not as i did even now her self command is invariable 
when is she dejected or melancholy when does she try 
to avoid society or appear restless and dissatisfied 
in it 
chapter 
the dashwoods were now settled at barton with tolerable 
comfort to themselves the house and the garden with all 
the objects surrounding them were now become familiar 
and the ordinary pursuits which had given to norland 
half its charms were engaged in again with far greater 
enjoyment than norland had been able to afford since the 
loss of their father sir john middleton who called 
on them every day for the first fortnight and who was 
not in the habit of seeing much occupation at home 
could not conceal his amazement on finding them always employed 
their visitors except those from barton park 
were not many for in spite of sir john s urgent entreaties 
that they would mix more in the neighbourhood and repeated 
assurances of his carriage being always at their service 
the independence of mrs dashwood s spirit overcame the 
wish of society for her children and she was resolute 
in declining to visit any family beyond the distance 
of a walk there were but few who could be so classed 
and it was not all of them that were attainable 
about a mile and a half from the cottage along the narrow 
winding valley of allenham which issued from that of barton 
as formerly described the girls had in one of their 
earliest walks discovered an ancient respectable looking 
mansion which by reminding them a little of norland 
interested their imagination and made them wish to be 
better acquainted with it but they learnt on enquiry 
that its possessor an elderly lady of very good character 
was unfortunately too infirm to mix with the world 
and never stirred from home 
the whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks 
the high downs which invited them from almost every window 
of the cottage to seek the exquisite enjoyment of air 
on their summits were a happy alternative when the dirt 
of the valleys beneath shut up their superior beauties 
and towards one of these hills did marianne and margaret 
one memorable morning direct their steps attracted by the 
partial sunshine of a showery sky and unable longer to bear 
the confinement which the settled rain of the two preceding 
days had occasioned the weather was not tempting enough 
to draw the two others from their pencil and their book 
in spite of marianne s declaration that the day would 
be lastingly fair and that every threatening cloud would 
be drawn off from their hills and the two girls set off 
together 
they gaily ascended the downs rejoicing in their own 
penetration at every glimpse of blue sky and when they 
caught in their faces the animating gales of a high 
south westerly wind they pitied the fears which had prevented 
their mother and elinor from sharing such delightful sensations 
is there a felicity in the world said marianne 
superior to this margaret we will walk here at least 
two hours 
margaret agreed and they pursued their way against 
the wind resisting it with laughing delight for about 
twenty minutes longer when suddenly the clouds united over 
their heads and a driving rain set full in their face 
chagrined and surprised they were obliged though unwillingly 
to turn back for no shelter was nearer than their own house 
one consolation however remained for them to which the 
exigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety 
it was that of running with all possible speed down the steep 
side of the hill which led immediately to their garden gate 
they set off marianne had at first the advantage 
but a false step brought her suddenly to the ground 
and margaret unable to stop herself to assist her 
was involuntarily hurried along and reached the bottom 
in safety 
a gentleman carrying a gun with two pointers 
playing round him was passing up the hill and within 
a few yards of marianne when her accident happened 
he put down his gun and ran to her assistance she had 
raised herself from the ground but her foot had been 
twisted in her fall and she was scarcely able to stand 
the gentleman offered his services and perceiving that her 
modesty declined what her situation rendered necessary 
took her up in his arms without farther delay and carried 
her down the hill then passing through the garden 
the gate of which had been left open by margaret he bore her 
directly into the house whither margaret was just arrived 
and quitted not his hold till he had seated her in a chair 
in the parlour 
elinor and her mother rose up in amazement at 
their entrance and while the eyes of both were fixed 
on him with an evident wonder and a secret admiration 
which equally sprung from his appearance he apologized 
for his intrusion by relating its because in a manner 
so frank and so graceful that his person which was 
uncommonly handsome received additional charms from his voice 
and expression had he been even old ugly and vulgar 
the gratitude and kindness of mrs dashwood would 
have been secured by any act of attention to her child 
but the influence of youth beauty and elegance 
gave an interest to the action which came home to her feelings 
she thanked him again and again and with a sweetness 
of address which always attended her invited him to 
be seated but this he declined as he was dirty and wet 
mrs dashwood then begged to know to whom she was obliged 
his name he replied was willoughby and his present 
home was at allenham from whence he hoped she would 
allow him the honour of calling tomorrow to enquire 
after miss dashwood the honour was readily granted 
and he then departed to make himself still more interesting 
in the midst of a heavy rain 
his manly beauty and more than common gracefulness 
were instantly the theme of general admiration 
and the laugh which his gallantry raised against marianne 
received particular spirit from his exterior attractions 
marianne herself had seen less of his person that the rest 
for the confusion which crimsoned over her face on his 
lifting her up had robbed her of the power of regarding 
him after their entering the house but she had seen 
enough of him to join in all the admiration of the others 
and with an energy which always adorned her praise 
his person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever 
drawn for the hero of a favourite story and in his carrying 
her into the house with so little previous formality there 
was a rapidity of thought which particularly recommended 
the action to her every circumstance belonging to him 
was interesting his name was good his residence was in 
their favourite village and she soon found out that of all 
manly dresses a shooting jacket was the most becoming 
her imagination was busy her reflections were pleasant 
and the pain of a sprained ankle was disregarded 
sir john called on them as soon as the next interval 
of fair weather that morning allowed him to get out 
of doors and marianne s accident being related to him 
he was eagerly asked whether he knew any gentleman 
of the name of willoughby at allenham 
willoughby cried sir john what is he 
in the country that is good news however i will 
ride over tomorrow and ask him to dinner on thursday 
you know him then said mrs dashwood 
know him to be sure i do why he is down here 
every year 
and what sort of a young man is he 
as good a kind of fellow as ever lived i assure you 
a very decent shot and there is not a bolder rider 
in england 
and is that all you can say for him cried marianne 
indignantly but what are his manners on more intimate 
acquaintance what his pursuits his talents and genius 
sir john was rather puzzled 
upon my soul said he i do not know much about him 
as to all that but he is a pleasant good humoured fellow 
and has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer 
i ever saw was she out with him today 
but marianne could no more satisfy him as to the 
colour of mr willoughby s pointer than he could 
describe to her the shades of his mind 
but who is he said elinor where does he come 
from has he a house at allenham 
on this point sir john could give more certain intelligence 
and he told them that mr willoughby had no property 
of his own in the country that he resided there only 
while he was visiting the old lady at allenham court 
to whom he was related and whose possessions he was 
to inherit adding yes yes he is very well worth 
catching i can tell you miss dashwood he has a pretty 
little estate of his own in somersetshire besides 
and if i were you i would not give him up to my 
younger sister in spite of all this tumbling down hills 
miss marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself 
brandon will be jealous if she does not take care 
i do not believe said mrs dashwood with a 
good humoured smile that mr willoughby will be incommoded 
by the attempts of either of my daughters towards what 
you call catching him it is not an employment to which 
they have been brought up men are very safe with us 
let them be ever so rich i am glad to find however 
from what you say that he is a respectable young man 
and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible 
he is as good a sort of fellow i believe 
as ever lived repeated sir john i remember 
last christmas at a little hop at the park he danced 
from eight of the clock till four without once sitting down 
did he indeed cried marianne with sparkling eyes 
and with elegance with spirit 
yes and he was up again at eight to ride to covert 
that is what i like that is what a young man ought 
to be whatever be his pursuits his eagerness in them 
should know no moderation and leave him no sense of fatigue 
aye aye i see how it will be said sir john i see 
how it will be you will be setting your cap at him now 
and never think of poor brandon 
that is an expression sir john said marianne 
warmly which i particularly dislike i abhor every 
common place phrase by which wit is intended and setting 
one s cap at a man or making a conquest are the most 
odious of all their tendency is gross and illiberal 
and if their construction could ever be deemed clever 
time has long ago destroyed all its ingenuity 
sir john did not much understand this reproof 
but he laughed as heartily as if he did and then replied 
ay you will make conquests enough i dare say 
one way or other poor brandon he is quite smitten already 
and he is very well worth setting your cap at i can 
tell you in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining 
of ankles 
chapter 
marianne s preserver as margaret with more elegance 
than precision styled willoughby called at the cottage 
early the next morning to make his personal enquiries 
he was received by mrs dashwood with more than politeness 
with a kindness which sir john s account of him and her own 
gratitude prompted and every thing that passed during 
the visit tended to assure him of the sense elegance 
mutual affection and domestic comfort of the family 
to whom accident had now introduced him of their 
personal charms he had not required a second interview 
to be convinced 
miss dashwood had a delicate complexion 
regular features and a remarkably pretty figure 
marianne was still handsomer her form though not so 
correct as her sister s in having the advantage of height 
was more striking and her face was so lovely that when 
in the common cannot of praise she was called a beautiful girl 
truth was less violently outraged than usually happens 
her skin was very brown but from its transparency 
her complexion was uncommonly brilliant her features 
were all good her smile was sweet and attractive 
and in her eyes which were very dark there was a life 
a spirit an eagerness which could hardily be seen 
without delight from willoughby their expression was at 
first held back by the embarrassment which the remembrance 
of his assistance created but when this passed away 
when her spirits became collected when she saw that to the 
perfect good breeding of the gentleman he united frankness 
and vivacity and above all when she heard him declare 
that of music and dancing he was passionately fond 
she gave him such a look of approbation as secured the 
largest share of his discourse to herself for the rest 
of his stay 
it was only necessary to mention any favourite 
amusement to engage her to talk she could not be 
silent when such points were introduced and she 
had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion 
they speedily discovered that their enjoyment of dancing 
and music was mutual and that it arose from a general 
conformity of judgment in all that related to either 
encouraged by this to a further examination of his opinions 
she proceeded to question him on the subject of books 
her favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt 
upon with so rapturous a delight that any young man of 
five and twenty must have been insensible indeed not to 
become an immediate convert to the excellence of such works 
however disregarded before their taste was strikingly alike 
the same books the same passages were idolized by each 
or if any difference appeared any objection arose 
it lasted no longer than till the force of her arguments 
and the brightness of her eyes could be displayed 
he acquiesced in all her decisions caught all her enthusiasm 
and long before his visit concluded they conversed 
with the familiarity of a long established acquaintance 
well marianne said elinor as soon as he had left them 
for one morning i think you have done pretty well 
you have already ascertained mr willoughby s opinion in 
almost every matter of importance you know what he thinks 
of cowper and scott you are certain of his estimating 
their beauties as he ought and you have received every 
assurance of his admiring pope no more than is proper 
but how is your acquaintance to be long supported under such 
extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse 
you will soon have exhausted each favourite topic 
another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments 
on picturesque beauty and second marriages and then 
you can have nothing farther to ask 
elinor cried marianne is this fair is this 
just are my ideas so scanty but i see what you mean 
i have been too much at my ease too happy too frank 
i have erred against every common place notion of decorum 
i have been open and sincere where i ought to have 
been reserved spiritless dull and deceitful had 
i talked only of the weather and the roads and had i 
spoken only once in ten minutes this reproach would have 
been spared 
my love said her mother you must not be offended 
with elinor she was only in jest i should scold 
her myself if she were capable of wishing to check 
the delight of your conversation with our new friend 
marianne was softened in a moment 
willoughby on his side gave every proof of his 
pleasure in their acquaintance which an evident wish 
of improving it could offer he came to them every day 
to enquire after marianne was at first his excuse but the 
encouragement of his reception to which every day gave 
greater kindness made such an excuse unnecessary before it 
had ceased to be possible by marianne s perfect recovery 
she was confined for some days to the house but never had 
any confinement been less irksome willoughby was a young 
man of good abilities quick imagination lively spirits 
and open affectionate manners he was exactly formed 
to engage marianne s heart for with all this he joined 
not only a captivating person but a natural ardour 
of mind which was now roused and increased by the example 
of her own and which recommended him to her affection 
beyond every thing else 
his society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment 
they read they talked they sang together his musical 
talents were considerable and he read with all the 
sensibility and spirit which edward had unfortunately wanted 
in mrs dashwood s estimation he was as faultless 
as in marianne s and elinor saw nothing to censure in him 
but a propensity in which he strongly resembled and peculiarly 
delighted her sister of saying too much what he thought on 
every occasion without attention to persons or circumstances 
in hastily forming and giving his opinion of other people 
in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment 
of undivided attention where his heart was engaged 
and in slighting too easily the forms of worldly propriety 
he displayed a want of caution which elinor could not approve 
in spite of all that he and marianne could say in its support 
marianne began now to perceive that the desperation 
which had seized her at sixteen and a half of ever 
seeing a man who could satisfy her ideas of perfection 
had been rash and unjustifiable willoughby was all 
that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour 
and in every brighter period as capable of attaching her 
and his behaviour declared his wishes to be in that respect 
as earnest as his abilities were strong 
her mother too in whose mind not one speculative 
thought of their marriage had been raised by his prospect 
of riches was led before the end of a week to hope and 
expect it and secretly to congratulate herself on having 
gained two such sons in law as edward and willoughby 
colonel brandon s partiality for marianne which had 
so early been discovered by his friends now first became 
perceptible to elinor when it ceased to be noticed 
by them their attention and wit were drawn off to his 
more fortunate rival and the raillery which the other 
had incurred before any partiality arose was removed 
when his feelings began really to call for the ridicule 
so justly annexed to sensibility elinor was obliged 
though unwillingly to believe that the sentiments which 
mrs jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction 
were now actually excited by her sister and that however 
a general resemblance of disposition between the parties 
might forward the affection of mr willoughby an equally 
striking opposition of character was no hindrance to the 
regard of colonel brandon she saw it with concern 
for what could a silent man of five and thirty hope 
when opposed to a very lively one of five and twenty and as 
she could not even wish him successful she heartily wished 
him indifferent she liked him in spite of his gravity 
and reserve she beheld in him an object of interest 
his manners though serious were mild and his reserve 
appeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits 
than of any natural gloominess of temper sir john 
had dropped hints of past injuries and disappointments 
which justified her belief of his being an unfortunate man 
and she regarded him with respect and compassion 
perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more 
because he was slighted by willoughby and marianne 
who prejudiced against him for being neither lively 
nor young seemed resolved to undervalue his merits 
brandon is just the kind of man said willoughby 
one day when they were talking of him together 
whom every body speaks well of and nobody cares about 
whom all are delighted to see and nobody remembers 
to talk to 
that is exactly what i think of him cried marianne 
do not boast of it however said elinor for it 
is injustice in both of you he is highly esteemed 
by all the family at the park and i never see him myself 
without taking pains to converse with him 
that he is patronised by you replied willoughby 
is certainly in his favour but as for the esteem 
of the others it is a reproach in itself who would 
submit to the indignity of being approved by such a woman 
as lady middleton and mrs jennings that could command 
the indifference of any body else 
but perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself 
and marianne will make amends for the regard of lady 
middleton and her mother if their praise is censure 
your censure may be praise for they are not more undiscerning 
than you are prejudiced and unjust 
in defence of your protege you can even be saucy 
my protege as you call him is a sensible man 
and sense will always have attractions for me 
yes marianne even in a man between thirty and forty 
he has seen a great deal of the world has been abroad 
has read and has a thinking mind i have found him 
capable of giving me much information on various subjects 
and he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of 
good breeding and good nature 
that is to say cried marianne contemptuously 
he has told you that in the east indies the climate is hot 
and the mosquitoes are troublesome 
he would have told me so i doubt not had i made 
any such inquiries but they happened to be points 
on which i had been previously informed 
perhaps said willoughby his observations may 
have extended to the existence of nabobs gold mohrs 
and palanquins 
i may venture to say that his observations 
have stretched much further than your candour 
but why should you dislike him 
i do not dislike him i consider him on the contrary 
as a very respectable man who has every body s good word 
and nobody s notice who has more money than he can spend 
more time than he knows how to employ and two new coats 
every year 
add to which cried marianne that he has 
neither genius taste nor spirit that his understanding 
has no brilliancy his feelings no ardour and his voice 
no expression 
you decide on his imperfections so much in the mass 
replied elinor and so much on the strength of your 
own imagination that the commendation i am able to give 
of him is comparatively cold and insipid i can only 
pronounce him to be a sensible man well bred well informed 
of gentle address and i believe possessing an amiable heart 
miss dashwood cried willoughby you are now using 
me unkindly you are endeavouring to disarm me by reason 
and to convince me against my will but it will not do 
you shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful i have 
three unanswerable reasons for disliking colonel brandon 
he threatened me with rain when i wanted it to be fine 
he has found fault with the hanging of my curricle 
and i cannot persuade him to buy my brown mare if it 
will be any satisfaction to you however to be told 
that i believe his character to be in other respects 
irreproachable i am ready to confess it and in return 
for an acknowledgment which must give me some pain 
you cannot deny me the privilege of disliking him as much 
as ever 
chapter 
little had mrs dashwood or her daughters imagined 
when they first came into devonshire that so many 
engagements would arise to occupy their time as shortly 
presented themselves or that they should have such frequent 
invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them little 
leisure for serious employment yet such was the case 
when marianne was recovered the schemes of amusement at home 
and abroad which sir john had been previously forming 
were put into execution the private balls at the park 
then began and parties on the water were made and 
accomplished as often as a showery october would allow 
in every meeting of the kind willoughby was included 
and the ease and familiarity which naturally attended 
these parties were exactly calculated to give increasing 
intimacy to his acquaintance with the dashwoods to afford 
him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of marianne 
of marking his animated admiration of her and of receiving 
in her behaviour to himself the most pointed assurance 
of her affection 
elinor could not be surprised at their attachment 
she only wished that it were less openly shewn and once 
or twice did venture to suggest the propriety of some 
self command to marianne but marianne abhorred all 
concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve 
and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not 
in themselves illaudable appeared to her not merely 
an unnecessary effort but a disgraceful subjection 
of reason to common place and mistaken notions 
willoughby thought the same and their behaviour at 
all times was an illustration of their opinions 
when he was present she had no eyes for any one else 
every thing he did was right every thing he said was clever 
if their evenings at the park were concluded with cards 
he cheated himself and all the rest of the party to get 
her a good hand if dancing formed the amusement 
of the night they were partners for half the time 
and when obliged to separate for a couple of dances 
were careful to stand together and scarcely spoke a word 
to any body else such conduct made them of course 
most exceedingly laughed at but ridicule could not shame 
and seemed hardly to provoke them 
mrs dashwood entered into all their feelings with 
a warmth which left her no inclination for checking this 
excessive display of them to her it was but the natural 
consequence of a strong affection in a young and ardent mind 
this was the season of happiness to marianne 
her heart was devoted to willoughby and the fond attachment 
to norland which she brought with her from sussex 
was more likely to be softened than she had thought it 
possible before by the charms which his society bestowed 
on her present home 
elinor s happiness was not so great her heart was not 
so much at ease nor her satisfaction in their amusements 
so pure they afforded her no companion that could make 
amends for what she had left behind nor that could teach 
her to think of norland with less regret than ever 
neither lady middleton nor mrs jennings could supply 
to her the conversation she missed although the latter 
was an everlasting talker and from the first had regarded 
her with a kindness which ensured her a large share of 
her discourse she had already repeated her own history 
to elinor three or four times and had elinor s memory been 
equal to her means of improvement she might have known 
very early in their acquaintance all the particulars of 
mr jenning s last illness and what he said to his wife 
a few minutes before he died lady middleton was more 
agreeable than her mother only in being more silent 
elinor needed little observation to perceive that her 
reserve was a mere calmness of manner with which sense 
had nothing to do towards her husband and mother she 
was the same as to them and intimacy was therefore 
neither to be looked for nor desired she had nothing 
to say one day that she had not said the day before 
her insipidity was invariable for even her spirits were 
always the same and though she did not oppose the parties 
arranged by her husband provided every thing were conducted 
in style and her two eldest children attended her 
she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them 
than she might have experienced in sitting at home 
and so little did her presence add to the pleasure 
of the others by any share in their conversation 
that they were sometimes only reminded of her being 
amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys 
in colonel brandon alone of all her new acquaintance 
did elinor find a person who could in any degree claim the 
respect of abilities excite the interest of friendship 
or give pleasure as a companion willoughby was out 
of the question her admiration and regard even her 
sisterly regard was all his own but he was a lover 
his attentions were wholly marianne s and a far less 
agreeable man might have been more generally pleasing 
colonel brandon unfortunately for himself had no such 
encouragement to think only of marianne and in conversing 
with elinor he found the greatest consolation for the 
indifference of her sister 
elinor s compassion for him increased as she had reason 
to suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already 
been known to him this suspicion was given by some words 
which accidently dropped from him one evening at the park 
when they were sitting down together by mutual consent 
while the others were dancing his eyes were fixed 
on marianne and after a silence of some minutes 
he said with a faint smile your sister i understand 
does not approve of second attachments 
no replied elinor her opinions are all romantic 
or rather as i believe she considers them 
impossible to exist 
i believe she does but how she contrives it 
without reflecting on the character of her own father 
who had himself two wives i know not a few years 
however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis 
of common sense and observation and then they may be 
more easy to define and to justify than they now are 
by any body but herself 
this will probably be the case he replied 
and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices 
of a young mind that one is sorry to see them give way 
to the reception of more general opinions 
i cannot agree with you there said elinor 
there are inconveniences attending such feelings 
as marianne s which all the charms of enthusiasm and 
ignorance of the world cannot atone for her systems have 
all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought 
and a better acquaintance with the world is what i look 
forward to as her greatest possible advantage 
after a short pause he resumed the conversation 
by saying 
does your sister make no distinction in her objections 
against a second attachment or is it equally criminal 
in every body are those who have been disappointed 
in their first choice whether from the inconstancy 
of its object or the perverseness of circumstances 
to be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives 
upon my word i am not acquainted with the minutiae 
of her principles i only know that i never yet heard her 
admit any instance of a second attachment s being pardonable 
this said he cannot hold but a change 
a total change of sentiments no no do not desire it 
for when the romantic refinements of a young mind 
are obliged to give way how frequently are they 
succeeded by such opinions as are but too common and too 
dangerous i speak from experience i once knew a lady 
who in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister 
who thought and judged like her but who from an inforced 
change from a series of unfortunate circumstances 
here he stopt suddenly appeared to think that he had said 
too much and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures 
which might not otherwise have entered elinor s head 
the lady would probably have passed without suspicion 
had he not convinced miss dashwood that what concerned 
her ought not to escape his lips as it was 
it required but a slight effort of fancy to connect his 
emotion with the tender recollection of past regard 
elinor attempted no more but marianne in her place 
would not have done so little the whole story would 
have been speedily formed under her active imagination 
and every thing established in the most melancholy order 
of disastrous love 
chapter 
as elinor and marianne were walking together the 
next morning the latter communicated a piece of news 
to her sister which in spite of all that she knew 
before of marianne s imprudence and want of thought 
surprised her by its extravagant testimony of both 
marianne told her with the greatest delight that 
willoughby had given her a horse one that he had bred 
himself on his estate in somersetshire and which was 
exactly calculated to carry a woman without considering 
that it was not in her mother s plan to keep any horse 
that if she were to alter her resolution in favour of 
this gift she must buy another for the servant and 
keep a servant to ride it and after all build a stable 
to receive them she had accepted the present without 
hesitation and told her sister of it in raptures 
he intends to send his groom into somersetshire 
immediately for it she added and when it arrives we 
will ride every day you shall share its use with me 
imagine to yourself my dear elinor the delight of a gallop 
on some of these downs 
most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of 
felicity to comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended 
the affair and for some time she refused to submit to them 
as to an additional servant the expense would be a trifle 
mamma she was sure would never object to it and any horse 
would do for him he might always get one at the park 
as to a stable the merest she would would be sufficient 
elinor then ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving 
such a present from a man so little or at least so lately 
known to her this was too much 
you are mistaken elinor said she warmly 
in supposing i know very little of willoughby 
i have not known him long indeed but i am much better 
acquainted with him than i am with any other creature 
in the world except yourself and mama it is not 
time or opportunity that is to determine intimacy 
it is disposition alone seven years would be insufficient 
to make some people acquainted with each other and seven 
days are more than enough for others i should hold 
myself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a horse 
from my brother than from willoughby of john i know 
very little though we have lived together for years 
but of willoughby my judgment has long been formed 
elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more 
she knew her sister s temper opposition on so tender a 
subject would only attach her the more to her own opinion 
but by an appeal to her affection for her mother 
by representing the inconveniences which that indulgent 
mother must draw on herself if as would probably be 
the case she consented to this increase of establishment 
marianne was shortly subdued and she promised not to 
tempt her mother to such imprudent kindness by mentioning 
the offer and to tell willoughby when she saw him next 
that it must be declined 
she was faithful to her word and when willoughby 
called at the cottage the same day elinor heard her 
express her disappointment to him in a low voice on 
being obliged to forego the acceptance of his present 
the reasons for this alteration were at the same time related 
and they were such as to make further entreaty on his 
side impossible his concern however was very apparent 
and after expressing it with earnestness he added 
in the same low voice but marianne the horse is 
still yours though you cannot use it now i shall keep 
it only till you can claim it when you leave barton 
to form your own establishment in a more lasting home 
queen mab shall receive you 
this was all overheard by miss dashwood and in the 
whole of the sentence in his manner of pronouncing it 
and in his addressing her sister by her christian name alone 
she instantly saw an intimacy so decided a meaning 
so direct as marked a perfect agreement between them 
from that moment she doubted not of their being engaged 
to each other and the belief of it created no other surprise 
than that she or any of their friends should be left 
by tempers so frank to discover it by accident 
margaret related something to her the next day 
which placed this matter in a still clearer light 
willoughby had spent the preceding evening with them 
and margaret by being left some time in the parlour 
with only him and marianne had had opportunity 
for observations which with a most important face 
she communicated to her eldest sister when they were 
next by themselves 
oh elinor she cried i have such a secret to 
tell you about marianne i am sure she will be married 
to mr willoughby very soon 
you have said so replied elinor almost every 
day since they first met on high church down and they 
had not known each other a week i believe before you 
were certain that marianne wore his picture round her neck 
but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great uncle 
but indeed this is quite another thing i am sure 
they will be married very soon for he has got a lock 
of her hair 
take care margaret it may be only the hair 
of some great uncle of his 
but indeed elinor it is marianne s i am almost 
sure it is for i saw him cut it off last night 
after tea when you and mama went out of the room 
they were whispering and talking together as fast as 
could be and he seemed to be begging something of her 
and presently he took up her scissors and cut off a long 
lock of her hair for it was all tumbled down her back 
and he kissed it and folded it up in a piece of white paper 
and put it into his pocket book 
for such particulars stated on such authority 
elinor could not withhold her credit nor was she disposed 
to it for the circumstance was in perfect unison with 
what she had heard and seen herself 
margaret s sagacity was not always displayed in a 
way so satisfactory to her sister when mrs jennings 
attacked her one evening at the park to give the name 
of the young man who was elinor s particular favourite 
which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her 
margaret answered by looking at her sister and saying 
i must not tell may i elinor 
this of course made every body laugh and elinor 
tried to laugh too but the effort was painful 
she was convinced that margaret had fixed on a person 
whose name she could not bear with composure to become 
a standing joke with mrs jennings 
marianne felt for her most sincerely but she did 
more harm than good to the because by turning very red 
and saying in an angry manner to margaret 
remember that whatever your conjectures may be 
you have no right to repeat them 
i never had any conjectures about it replied margaret 
it was you who told me of it yourself 
this increased the mirth of the company and margaret 
was eagerly pressed to say something more 
oh pray miss margaret let us know all about it 
said mrs jennings what is the gentleman s name 
i must not tell madam but i know very well what it is 
and i know where he is too 
yes yes we can guess where he is at his own house 
at norland to be sure he is the curate of the parish 
i dare say 
no that he is not he is of no profession at all 
margaret said marianne with great warmth 
you know that all this is an invention of your own 
and that there is no such person in existence 
well then he is lately dead marianne for i 
am sure there was such a man once and his name begins 
with an f 
most grateful did elinor feel to lady middleton 
for observing at this moment that it rained very hard 
though she believed the interruption to proceed less from 
any attention to her than from her ladyship s great dislike 
of all such inelegant subjects of raillery as delighted 
her husband and mother the idea however started by her 
was immediately pursued by colonel brandon who was 
on every occasion mindful of the feelings of others 
and much was said on the subject of rain by both of them 
willoughby opened the piano forte and asked marianne 
to sit down to it and thus amidst the various endeavours 
of different people to quit the topic it fell to the ground 
but not so easily did elinor recover from the alarm into 
which it had thrown her 
a party was formed this evening for going on the 
following day to see a very fine place about twelve miles 
from barton belonging to a brother in law of colonel brandon 
without whose interest it could not be seen as the proprietor 
who was then abroad had left strict orders on that head 
the grounds were declared to be highly beautiful 
and sir john who was particularly warm in their praise 
might be allowed to be a tolerable judge for he had 
formed parties to visit them at least twice every summer 
for the last ten years they contained a noble piece 
of water a sail on which was to a form a great part of 
the morning s amusement cold provisions were to be taken 
open carriages only to be employed and every thing 
conducted in the usual style of a complete party of pleasure 
to some few of the company it appeared rather 
a bold undertaking considering the time of year 
and that it had rained every day for the last fortnight 
and mrs dashwood who had already a cold was persuaded 
by elinor to stay at home 
chapter 
their intended excursion to whitwell turned out 
very different from what elinor had expected she was 
prepared to be wet through fatigued and frightened 
but the event was still more unfortunate for they did 
not go at all 
by ten of the clock the whole party was assembled at 
the park where they were to breakfast the morning 
was rather favourable though it had rained all night 
as the clouds were then dispersing across the sky 
and the sun frequently appeared they were all in high 
spirits and good humour eager to be happy and determined 
to submit to the greatest inconveniences and hardships 
rather than be otherwise 
while they were at breakfast the letters were brought in 
among the rest there was one for colonel brandon he 
took it looked at the direction changed colour 
and immediately left the room 
what is the matter with brandon said sir john 
nobody could tell 
i hope he has had no bad news said lady middleton 
it must be something extraordinary that could make colonel 
brandon leave my breakfast table so suddenly 
in about five minutes he returned 
no bad news colonel i hope said mrs jennings 
as soon as he entered the room 
none at all madam i thank you 
was it from avignon i hope it is not to say 
that your sister is worse 
no madam it came from town and is merely 
a letter of business 
but how came the hand to discompose you so much 
if it was only a letter of business come come 
this will not do colonel so let us hear the truth of it 
my dear madam said lady middleton recollect what 
you are saying 
perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin fanny 
is married said mrs jennings without attending 
to her daughter s reproof 
no indeed it is not 
well then i know who it is from colonel and i 
hope she is well 
whom do you mean madam said he colouring a little 
oh you know who i mean 
i am particularly sorry madam said he 
addressing lady middleton that i should receive this 
letter today for it is on business which requires 
my immediate attendance in town 
in town cried mrs jennings what can you 
have to do in town at this time of year 
my own loss is great be continued in being obliged 
to leave so agreeable a party but i am the more concerned 
as i fear my presence is necessary to gain your admittance 
at whitwell 
what a blow upon them all was this 
but if you write a note to the housekeeper mr brandon 
said marianne eagerly will it not be sufficient 
he shook his head 
we must go said sir john it shall not be put 
off when we are so near it you cannot go to town till 
tomorrow brandon that is all 
i wish it could be so easily settled but it 
is not in my power to delay my journey for one day 
if you would but let us know what your business is 
said mrs jennings we might see whether it could be put 
off or not 
you would not be six hours later said willoughby 
if you were to defer your journey till our return 
i cannot afford to lose one hour 
elinor then heard willoughby say in a low voice to marianne 
there are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure 
brandon is one of them he was afraid of catching cold 
i dare say and invented this trick for getting out of it 
i would lay fifty guineas the letter was of his own writing 
i have no doubt of it replied marianne 
there is no persuading you to change your mind 
brandon i know of old said sir john when once you 
are determined on anything but however i hope you 
will think better of it consider here are the two miss 
careys come over from newton the three miss dashwoods 
walked up from the cottage and mr willoughby got up 
two hours before his usual time on purpose to go to whitwell 
colonel brandon again repeated his sorrow at being 
the because of disappointing the party but at the same 
time declared it to be unavoidable 
well then when will you come back again 
i hope we shall see you at barton added her ladyship 
as soon as you can conveniently leave town and we must 
put off the party to whitwell till you return 
you are very obliging but it is so uncertain 
when i may have it in my power to return that i dare 
not engage for it at all 
oh he must and shall come back cried sir john 
if he is not here by the end of the week i shall go 
after him 
ay so do sir john cried mrs jennings and then 
perhaps you may find out what his business is 
i do not want to pry into other men s concerns 
i suppose it is something he is ashamed of 
colonel brandon s horses were announced 
you do not go to town on horseback do you 
added sir john 
no only to honiton i shall then go post 
well as you are resolved to go i wish you 
a good journey but you had better change your mind 
i assure you it is not in my power 
he then took leave of the whole party 
is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters 
in town this winter miss dashwood 
i am afraid none at all 
then i must bid you farewell for a longer time 
than i should wish to do 
to marianne he merely bowed and said nothing 
come colonel said mrs jennings before you go 
do let us know what you are going about 
he wished her a good morning and attended by sir john 
left the room 
the complaints and lamentations which politeness 
had hitherto restrained now burst forth universally 
and they all agreed again and again how provoking it was 
to be so disappointed 
i can guess what his business is however 
said mrs jennings exultingly 
can you madam said almost every body 
yes it is about miss williams i am sure 
and who is miss williams asked marianne 
what do not you know who miss williams is i am 
sure you must have heard of her before she is a relation 
of the colonel s my dear a very near relation we will 
not say how near for fear of shocking the young ladies 
then lowering her voice a little she said to elinor 
she is his natural daughter 
indeed 
oh yes and as like him as she can stare 
i dare say the colonel will leave her all his fortune 
when sir john returned he joined most heartily 
in the general regret on so unfortunate an event 
concluding however by observing that as they were 
all got together they must do something by way of 
being happy and after some consultation it was agreed 
that although happiness could only be enjoyed at whitwell 
they might procure a tolerable composure of mind by driving 
about the country the carriages were then ordered 
willoughby s was first and marianne never looked 
happier than when she got into it he drove through 
the park very fast and they were soon out of sight 
and nothing more of them was seen till their return 
which did not happen till after the return of all the rest 
they both seemed delighted with their drive but said 
only in general terms that they had kept in the lanes 
while the others went on the downs 
it was settled that there should be a dance in the evening 
and that every body should be extremely merry all day long 
some more of the careys came to dinner and they had the 
pleasure of sitting down nearly twenty to table which sir 
john observed with great contentment willoughby took 
his usual place between the two elder miss dashwoods 
mrs jennings sat on elinor s right hand and they had not 
been long seated before she leant behind her and willoughby 
and said to marianne loud enough for them both to hear 
i have found you out in spite of all your tricks 
i know where you spent the morning 
marianne coloured and replied very hastily 
where pray 
did not you know said willoughby that we had 
been out in my curricle 
yes yes mr impudence i know that very well 
and i was determined to find out where you had been to 
i hope you like your house miss marianne it is a very 
large one i know and when i come to see you i hope you 
will have new furnished it for it wanted it very much 
when i was there six years ago 
marianne turned away in great confusion 
mrs jennings laughed heartily and elinor found that in her 
resolution to know where they had been she had actually 
made her own woman enquire of mr willoughby s groom 
and that she had by that method been informed that they 
had gone to allenham and spent a considerable time there 
in walking about the garden and going all over the house 
elinor could hardly believe this to be true 
as it seemed very unlikely that willoughby should propose 
or marianne consent to enter the house while mrs smith was 
in it with whom marianne had not the smallest acquaintance 
as soon as they left the dining room elinor enquired 
of her about it and great was her surprise when she 
found that every circumstance related by mrs jennings 
was perfectly true marianne was quite angry with her 
for doubting it 
why should you imagine elinor that we did not 
go there or that we did not see the house is not it 
what you have often wished to do yourself 
yes marianne but i would not go while mrs smith 
was there and with no other companion than mr willoughby 
mr willoughby however is the only person who can 
have a right to shew that house and as he went in an open 
carriage it was impossible to have any other companion 
i never spent a pleasanter morning in my life 
i am afraid replied elinor that the pleasantness 
of an employment does not always evince its propriety 
on the contrary nothing can be a stronger proof 
of it elinor for if there had been any real impropriety 
in what i did i should have been sensible of it at 
the time for we always know when we are acting wrong 
and with such a conviction i could have had no pleasure 
but my dear marianne as it has already exposed you 
to some very impertinent remarks do you not now begin 
to doubt the discretion of your own conduct 
if the impertinent remarks of mrs jennings are 
to be the proof of impropriety in conduct we are all 
offending every moment of our lives i value not her 
censure any more than i should do her commendation 
i am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking 
over mrs smith s grounds or in seeing her house 
they will one day be mr willoughby s and 
if they were one day to be your own marianne 
you would not be justified in what you have done 
she blushed at this hint but it was even visibly 
gratifying to her and after a ten minutes interval of 
earnest thought she came to her sister again and said 
with great good humour perhaps elinor it was rather 
ill judged in me to go to allenham but mr willoughby wanted 
particularly to shew me the place and it is a charming house 
i assure you there is one remarkably pretty sitting room 
up stairs of a nice comfortable size for constant use 
and with modern furniture it would be delightful 
it is a corner room and has windows on two sides 
on one side you look across the bowling green behind 
the house to a beautiful hanging wood and on the other you 
have a view of the church and village and beyond them 
of those fine bold hills that we have so often admired 
i did not see it to advantage for nothing could be 
more forlorn than the furniture but if it were newly 
fitted up a couple of hundred pounds willoughby says 
would make it one of the pleasantest summer rooms 
in england 
could elinor have listened to her without interruption 
from the others she would have described every room 
in the house with equal delight 
chapter 
the sudden termination of colonel brandon s visit 
at the park with his steadiness in concealing its because 
filled the mind and raised the wonder of mrs jennings 
for two or three days she was a great wonderer as every 
one must be who takes a very lively interest in all the 
comings and goings of all their acquaintance she wondered 
with little intermission what could be the reason of it 
was sure there must be some bad news and thought over 
every kind of distress that could have befallen him 
with a fixed determination that he should not escape 
them all 
something very melancholy must be the matter 
i am sure said she i could see it in his face 
poor man i am afraid his circumstances may be bad 
the estate at delaford was never reckoned more than two thousand 
a year and his brother left everything sadly involved 
i do think he must have been sent for about money matters 
for what else can it be i wonder whether it is so 
i would give anything to know the truth of it perhaps it 
is about miss williams and by the bye i dare say it is 
because he looked so conscious when i mentioned her 
may be she is ill in town nothing in the world more likely 
for i have a notion she is always rather sickly 
i would lay any wager it is about miss williams 
it is not so very likely he should be distressed in 
his circumstances now for he is a very prudent man 
and to be sure must have cleared the estate by this time 
i wonder what it can be may be his sister is worse 
at avignon and has sent for him over his setting off 
in such a hurry seems very like it well i wish him out 
of all his trouble with all my heart and a good wife into 
the bargain 
so wondered so talked mrs jennings her opinion 
varying with every fresh conjecture and all seeming 
equally probable as they arose elinor though she felt 
really interested in the welfare of colonel brandon 
could not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly 
away which mrs jennings was desirous of her feeling 
for besides that the circumstance did not in her opinion 
justify such lasting amazement or variety of speculation 
her wonder was otherwise disposed of it was engrossed 
by the extraordinary silence of her sister and willoughby 
on the subject which they must know to be peculiarly 
interesting to them all as this silence continued 
every day made it appear more strange and more incompatible 
with the disposition of both why they should not openly 
acknowledge to her mother and herself what their constant 
behaviour to each other declared to have taken place 
elinor could not imagine 
she could easily conceive that marriage might not 
be immediately in their power for though willoughby 
was independent there was no reason to believe him rich 
his estate had been rated by sir john at about six or seven 
hundred a year but he lived at an expense to which that income 
could hardly be equal and he had himself often complained 
of his poverty but for this strange kind of secrecy 
maintained by them relative to their engagement which 
in fact concealed nothing at all she could not account 
and it was so wholly contradictory to their general 
opinions and practice that a doubt sometimes entered 
her mind of their being really engaged and this doubt 
was enough to prevent her making any inquiry of marianne 
nothing could be more expressive of attachment 
to them all than willoughby s behaviour to marianne 
it had all the distinguishing tenderness which a lover s 
heart could give and to the rest of the family it was the 
affectionate attention of a son and a brother the cottage 
seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home 
many more of his hours were spent there than at allenham 
and if no general engagement collected them at the park 
the exercise which called him out in the morning was 
almost certain of ending there where the rest of the day 
was spent by himself at the side of marianne and by his 
favourite pointer at her feet 
one evening in particular about a week after 
colonel brandon left the country his heart seemed 
more than usually open to every feeling of attachment 
to the objects around him and on mrs dashwood s 
happening to mention her design of improving the cottage 
in the spring he warmly opposed every alteration 
of a place which affection had established as perfect with him 
what he exclaimed improve this dear cottage 
no that i will never consent to not a stone must 
be added to its walls not an inch to its size 
if my feelings are regarded 
do not be alarmed said miss dashwood 
nothing of the kind will be done for my mother 
will never have money enough to attempt it 
i am heartily glad of it he cried may she 
always be poor if she can employ her riches no better 
thank you willoughby but you may be assured that i 
would not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment 
of yours or of any one whom i loved for all the improvements 
in the world depend upon it that whatever unemployed 
sum may remain when i make up my accounts in the spring 
i would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose 
of it in a manner so painful to you but are you really 
so attached to this place as to see no defect in it 
i am said he to me it is faultless nay more 
i consider it as the only form of building in which happiness 
is attainable and were i rich enough i would instantly pull 
combe down and build it up again in the exact plan of this 
cottage 
with dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes 
i suppose said elinor 
yes cried he in the same eager tone with all 
and every thing belonging to it in no one convenience 
or inconvenience about it should the least variation 
be perceptible then and then only under such a roof i 
might perhaps be as happy at combe as i have been at barton 
i flatter myself replied elinor that even under 
the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase 
you will hereafter find your own house as faultless as you 
now do this 
there certainly are circumstances said willoughby 
which might greatly endear it to me but this place will 
always have one claim of my affection which no other can 
possibly share 
mrs dashwood looked with pleasure at marianne 
whose fine eyes were fixed so expressively on willoughby 
as plainly denoted how well she understood him 
how often did i wish added he when i was at 
allenham this time twelvemonth that barton cottage were 
inhabited i never passed within view of it without admiring 
its situation and grieving that no one should live in it 
how little did i then think that the very first news 
i should hear from mrs smith when i next came into 
the country would be that barton cottage was taken and i 
felt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event 
which nothing but a kind of prescience of what happiness i 
should experience from it can account for must it not have 
been so marianne speaking to her in a lowered voice 
then continuing his former tone he said and yet this 
house you would spoil mrs dashwood you would rob it 
of its simplicity by imaginary improvement and this dear 
parlour in which our acquaintance first began and in which 
so many happy hours have been since spent by us together 
you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance 
and every body would be eager to pass through the room 
which has hitherto contained within itself more real 
accommodation and comfort than any other apartment of 
the handsomest dimensions in the world could possibly afford 
mrs dashwood again assured him that no alteration 
of the kind should be attempted 
you are a good woman he warmly replied 
your promise makes me easy extend it a little farther 
and it will make me happy tell me that not only your 
house will remain the same but that i shall ever find 
you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling and that you 
will always consider me with the kindness which has made 
everything belonging to you so dear to me 
the promise was readily given and willoughby s 
behaviour during the whole of the evening declared 
at once his affection and happiness 
shall we see you tomorrow to dinner said mrs dashwood 
when he was leaving them i do not ask you to come in 
the morning for we must walk to the park to call on lady 
middleton 
he engaged to be with them by four of the clock 
chapter 
mrs dashwood s visit to lady middleton took place 
the next day and two of her daughters went with her 
but marianne excused herself from being of the party 
under some trifling pretext of employment and her mother 
who concluded that a promise had been made by willoughby 
the night before of calling on her while they were absent 
was perfectly satisfied with her remaining at home 
on their return from the park they found willoughby s 
curricle and servant in waiting at the cottage 
and mrs dashwood was convinced that her conjecture 
had been just so far it was all as she had foreseen 
but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight 
had taught her to expect they were no sooner in the 
passage than marianne came hastily out of the parlour 
apparently in violent affliction with her handkerchief 
at her eyes and without noticing them ran up stairs 
surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room 
she had just quitted where they found only willoughby 
who was leaning against the mantel piece with his back 
towards them he turned round on their coming in 
and his countenance shewed that he strongly partook 
of the emotion which over powered marianne 
is anything the matter with her cried mrs dashwood 
as she entered is she ill 
i hope not he replied trying to look cheerful 
and with a forced smile presently added it is i who may 
rather expect to be ill for i am now suffering under a 
very heavy disappointment 
disappointment 
yes for i am unable to keep my engagement with you 
mrs smith has this morning exercised the privilege 
of riches upon a poor dependent cousin by sending me on 
business to london i have just received my dispatches 
and taken my farewell of allenham and by way of exhilaration 
i am now come to take my farewell of you 
to london and are you going this morning 
almost this moment 
this is very unfortunate but mrs smith must 
be obliged and her business will not detain you from 
us long i hope 
he coloured as he replied you are very kind but i 
have no idea of returning into devonshire immediately 
my visits to mrs smith are never repeated within 
the twelvemonth 
and is mrs smith your only friend is allenham the only 
house in the neighbourhood to which you will be welcome 
for shame willoughby can you wait for an invitation here 
his colour increased and with his eyes fixed 
on the ground he only replied you are too good 
mrs dashwood looked at elinor with surprise 
elinor felt equal amazement for a few moments every one 
was silent mrs dashwood first spoke 
i have only to add my dear willoughby that at 
barton cottage you will always be welcome for i will not 
press you to return here immediately because you only 
can judge how far that might be pleasing to mrs smith 
and on this head i shall be no more disposed to question 
your judgment than to doubt your inclination 
my engagements at present replied willoughby 
confusedly are of such a nature that i dare not flatter 
myself 
he stopt mrs dashwood was too much astonished 
to speak and another pause succeeded this was broken 
by willoughby who said with a faint smile it is folly 
to linger in this manner i will not torment myself 
any longer by remaining among friends whose society 
it is impossible for me now to enjoy 
he then hastily took leave of them all and left 
the room they saw him step into his carriage 
and in a minute it was out of sight 
mrs dashwood felt too much for speech and instantly 
quitted the parlour to give way in solitude to the concern 
and alarm which this sudden departure occasioned 
elinor s uneasiness was at least equal to her mother s 
she thought of what had just passed with anxiety and distrust 
willoughby s behaviour in taking leave of them his 
embarrassment 
and affectation of cheerfulness and above all his 
unwillingness 
to accept her mother s invitation a backwardness so unlike a 
lover 
so unlike himself greatly disturbed her one moment she feared 
that no serious design had ever been formed on his side and the 
next that some unfortunate quarrel had taken place between him 
and 
her sister the distress in which marianne had quitted the room 
was such as a serious quarrel could most reasonably account for 
though when she considered what marianne s love for him was 
a quarrel seemed almost impossible 
but whatever might be the particulars of their separation 
her sister s affliction was indubitable and she thought 
with the tenderest compassion of that violent sorrow 
which marianne was in all probability not merely giving 
way to as a relief but feeding and encouraging as a duty 
in about half an hour her mother returned and though 
her eyes were red her countenance was not uncheerful 
our dear willoughby is now some miles from barton elinor 
said she as she sat down to work and with how heavy a heart 
does he travel 
it is all very strange so suddenly to be gone it 
seems but the work of a moment and last night he was 
with us so happy so cheerful so affectionate and now 
after only ten minutes notice gone too without intending 
to return something more than what be owned to us must 
have happened he did not speak he did not behave 
like himself you must have seen the difference as well as i 
what can it be can they have quarrelled why else should he 
have shewn such unwillingness to accept your invitation here 
it was not inclination that he wanted elinor i could 
plainly see that he had not the power of accepting it 
i have thought it all over i assure you and i can 
perfectly account for every thing that at first seemed 
strange to me as well as to you 
can you indeed 
yes i have explained it to myself in the most 
satisfactory way but you elinor who love to doubt 
where you can it will not satisfy you i know but you 
shall not talk me out of my trust in it i am persuaded 
that mrs smith suspects his regard for marianne 
disapproves of it perhaps because she has other views 
for him and on that account is eager to get him away 
and that the business which she sends him off to transact 
is invented as an excuse to dismiss him this is what i 
believe to have happened he is moreover aware that she 
does disapprove the connection he dares not therefore 
at present confess to her his engagement with marianne 
and he feels himself obliged from his dependent situation 
to give into her schemes and absent himself from 
devonshire for a while you will tell me i know 
that this may or may not have happened but i will listen 
to no cavil unless you can point out any other method 
of understanding the affair as satisfactory at this 
and now elinor what have you to say 
nothing for you have anticipated my answer 
then you would have told me that it might or might not 
have happened oh elinor how incomprehensible are your 
feelings you had rather take evil upon credit than good 
you had rather look out for misery for marianne and guilt 
for poor willoughby than an apology for the latter 
you are resolved to think him blameable because he took 
leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour 
has shewn and is no allowance to be made for inadvertence 
or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment are 
no probabilities to be accepted merely because they 
are not certainties is nothing due to the man whom we 
have all such reason to love and no reason in the world 
to think ill of to the possibility of motives unanswerable 
in themselves though unavoidably secret for a while and 
after all what is it you suspect him of 
i can hardly tell myself but suspicion of 
something unpleasant is the inevitable consequence 
of such an alteration as we just witnessed in him 
there is great truth however in what you have now urged 
of the allowances which ought to be made for him and it 
is my wish to be candid in my judgment of every body 
willoughby may undoubtedly have very sufficient 
reasons for his conduct and i will hope that he has 
but it would have been more like willoughby to acknowledge 
them at once secrecy may be advisable but still i 
cannot help wondering at its being practiced by him 
do not blame him however for departing from 
his character where the deviation is necessary 
but you really do admit the justice of what i have said 
in his defence i am happy and he is acquitted 
not entirely it may be proper to conceal their 
engagement if they are engaged from mrs smith 
and if that is the case it must be highly expedient 
for willoughby to be but little in devonshire at present 
but this is no excuse for their concealing it from us 
concealing it from us my dear child do you accuse 
willoughby and marianne of concealment this is strange 
indeed when your eyes have been reproaching them every day 
for incautiousness 
i want no proof of their affection said elinor 
but of their engagement i do 
i am perfectly satisfied of both 
yet not a syllable has been said to you on the 
subject by either of them 
i have not wanted syllables where actions have 
spoken so plainly has not his behaviour to marianne 
and to all of us for at least the last fortnight 
declared that he loved and considered her as his future wife 
and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest 
relation have we not perfectly understood each other 
has not my consent been daily asked by his looks his manner 
his attentive and affectionate respect my elinor 
is it possible to doubt their engagement how could 
such a thought occur to you how is it to be supposed 
that willoughby persuaded as he must be of your 
sister s love should leave her and leave her perhaps 
for months without telling her of his affection that 
they should part without a mutual exchange of confidence 
i confess replied elinor that every circumstance 
except one is in favour of their engagement 
but that one is the total silence of both on the subject 
and with me it almost outweighs every other 
how strange this is you must think wretchedly indeed 
of willoughby if after all that has openly passed between them 
you can doubt the nature of the terms on which they are together 
has he been acting a part in his behaviour to your sister 
all this time do you suppose him really indifferent to her 
no i cannot think that he must and does love her 
i am sure 
but with a strange kind of tenderness if he can 
leave her with such indifference such carelessness 
of the future as you attribute to him 
you must remember my dear mother that i have never 
considered this matter as certain i have had my doubts 
i confess but they are fainter than they were and they 
may soon be entirely done away if we find they correspond 
every fear of mine will be removed 
a mighty concession indeed if you were to see 
them at the altar you would suppose they were going to 
be married ungracious girl but i require no such proof 
nothing in my opinion has ever passed to justify doubt 
no secrecy has been attempted all has been uniformly open 
and unreserved you cannot doubt your sister s wishes 
it must be willoughby therefore whom you suspect but why 
is he not a man of honour and feeling has there been any 
inconsistency on his side to create alarm can he be deceitful 
i hope not i believe not cried elinor 
i love willoughby sincerely love him and suspicion of his 
integrity cannot be more painful to yourself than to me 
it has been involuntary and i will not encourage it 
i was startled i confess by the alteration in his 
manners this morning he did not speak like himself 
and did not return your kindness with any cordiality 
but all this may be explained by such a situation of his 
affairs as you have supposed he had just parted from 
my sister had seen her leave him in the greatest affliction 
and if he felt obliged from a fear of offending mrs smith 
to resist the temptation of returning here soon and yet 
aware that by declining your invitation by saying 
that he was going away for some time he should seem 
to act an ungenerous a suspicious part by our family 
be might well be embarrassed and disturbed in such a case 
a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been 
more to his honour i think as well as more consistent 
with his general character but i will not raise objections 
against any one s conduct on so illiberal a foundation 
as a difference in judgment from myself or a deviation from 
what i may think right and consistent 
you speak very properly willoughby certainly does 
not deserve to be suspected though we have not known 
him long he is no stranger in this part of the world 
and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage had he been 
in a situation to act independently and marry immediately 
it might have been odd that he should leave us without 
acknowledging everything to me at once but this is not the case 
it is an engagement in some respects not prosperously begun 
for their marriage must be at a very uncertain distance 
and even secrecy as far as it can be observed may now 
be very advisable 
they were interrupted by the entrance of margaret 
and elinor was then at liberty to think over the representations 
of her mother to acknowledge the probability of many 
and hope for the justice of all 
they saw nothing of marianne till dinner time 
when she entered the room and took her place at the table 
without saying a word her eyes were red and swollen 
and it seemed as if her tears were even then restrained 
with difficulty she avoided the looks of them all 
could neither eat nor speak and after some time on her 
mother s silently pressing her hand with tender compassion 
her small degree of fortitude was quite overcome she burst 
into tears and left the room 
this violent oppression of spirits continued the 
whole evening she was without any power because she 
was without any desire of command over herself 
the slightest mention of anything relative to willoughby 
overpowered her in an instant and though her family 
were most anxiously attentive to her comfort it was 
impossible for them if they spoke at all to keep clear 
of every subject which her feelings connected with him 
chapter 
marianne would have thought herself very inexcusable 
had she been able to sleep at all the first night 
after parting from willoughby she would have been 
ashamed to look her family in the face the next morning 
had she not risen from her bed in more need of repose 
than when she lay down in it but the feelings which 
made such composure a disgrace left her in no danger 
of incurring it she was awake the whole night and she 
wept the greatest part of it she got up with a headache 
was unable to talk and unwilling to take any nourishment 
giving pain every moment to her mother and sisters 
and forbidding all attempt at consolation from either 
her sensibility was potent enough 
when breakfast was over she walked out by herself 
and wandered about the village of allenham indulging the 
recollection of past enjoyment and crying over the present 
reverse for the chief of the morning 
the evening passed off in the equal indulgence of feeling 
she played over every favourite song that she had been used 
to play to willoughby every air in which their voices 
had been oftenest joined and sat at the instrument gazing 
on every line of music that he had written out for her 
till her heart was so heavy that no farther sadness 
could be gained and this nourishment of grief was every 
day applied she spent whole hours at the pianoforte 
alternately singing and crying her voice often totally 
suspended by her tears in books too as well as in music 
she courted the misery which a contrast between the past 
and present was certain of giving she read nothing 
but what they had been used to read together 
such violence of affliction indeed could not be supported 
for ever it sunk within a few days into a calmer melancholy 
but these employments to which she daily recurred 
her solitary walks and silent meditations still produced 
occasional effusions of sorrow as lively as ever 
no letter from willoughby came and none seemed expected 
by marianne her mother was surprised and elinor again 
became uneasy but mrs dashwood could find explanations 
whenever she wanted them which at least satisfied herself 
remember elinor said she how very often sir john 
fetches our letters himself from the post and carries them 
to it we have already agreed that secrecy may be necessary 
and we must acknowledge that it could not be maintained if 
their correspondence were to pass through sir john s hands 
elinor could not deny the truth of this and she tried 
to find in it a motive sufficient for their silence 
but there was one method so direct so simple and in 
her opinion so eligible of knowing the real state 
of the affair and of instantly removing all mystery 
that she could not help suggesting it to her mother 
why do you not ask marianne at once said she 
whether she is or she is not engaged to willoughby from you 
her mother and so kind so indulgent a mother the question 
could not give offence it would be the natural result 
of your affection for her she used to be all unreserve 
and to you more especially 
i would not ask such a question for the world 
supposing it possible that they are not engaged 
what distress would not such an enquiry inflict at any 
rate it would be most ungenerous i should never deserve 
her confidence again after forcing from her a confession 
of what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one 
i know marianne s heart i know that she dearly loves me 
and that i shall not be the last to whom the affair is made 
known 
when circumstances make the revealment of it eligible 
i would not attempt to force the confidence of any one 
of a child much less because a sense of duty would prevent 
the denial which her wishes might direct 
elinor thought this generosity overstrained 
considering her sister s youth and urged the matter farther 
but in vain common sense common care common prudence 
were all sunk in mrs dashwood s romantic delicacy 
it was several days before willoughby s name 
was mentioned before marianne by any of her family 
sir john and mrs jennings indeed were not so nice 
their witticisms added pain to many a painful hour 
but one evening mrs dashwood accidentally taking up a 
volume of shakespeare exclaimed 
we have never finished hamlet marianne our dear 
willoughby went away before we could get through it 
we will put it by that when he comes again but it may 
be months perhaps before that happens 
months cried marianne with strong surprise 
no nor many weeks 
mrs dashwood was sorry for what she had said 
but it gave elinor pleasure as it produced a reply 
from marianne so expressive of confidence in willoughby 
and knowledge of his intentions 
one morning about a week after his leaving the country 
marianne was prevailed on to join her sisters in their 
usual walk instead of wandering away by herself 
hitherto she had carefully avoided every companion in 
her rambles if her sisters intended to walk on the downs 
she directly stole away towards the lanes if they talked 
of the valley she was as speedy in climbing the hills 
and could never be found when the others set off 
but at length she was secured by the exertions of elinor 
who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion they walked 
along the road through the valley and chiefly in silence 
for marianne s mind could not be controlled and elinor 
satisfied with gaining one point would not then attempt more 
beyond the entrance of the valley where the country 
though still rich was less wild and more open a long 
stretch of the road which they had travelled on first coming 
to barton lay before them and on reaching that point 
they stopped to look around them and examine a prospect 
which formed the distance of their view from the cottage 
from a spot which they had never happened to reach in any 
of their walks before 
amongst the objects in the scene they soon discovered 
an animated one it was a man on horseback riding towards them 
in a few minutes they could distinguish him to be a gentleman 
and in a moment afterwards marianne rapturously exclaimed 
it is he it is indeed i know it is and was 
hastening to meet him when elinor cried out 
indeed marianne i think you are mistaken it is 
not willoughby the person is not tall enough for him 
and has not his air 
he has he has cried marianne i am sure he has 
his air his coat his horse i knew how soon he would come 
she walked eagerly on as she spoke and elinor 
to screen marianne from particularity as she felt almost 
certain of its not being willoughby quickened her 
pace and kept up with her they were soon within 
thirty yards of the gentleman marianne looked again 
her heart sunk within her and abruptly turning round 
she was hurrying back when the voices of both her sisters 
were raised to detain her a third almost as well known 
as willoughby s joined them in begging her to stop 
and she turned round with surprise to see and welcome 
edward ferrars 
he was the only person in the world who could 
at that moment be forgiven for not being willoughby 
the only one who could have gained a smile from her 
but she dispersed her tears to smile on him and in her 
sister s happiness forgot for a time her own disappointment 
he dismounted and giving his horse to his servant 
walked back with them to barton whither he was purposely 
coming to visit them 
he was welcomed by them all with great cordiality 
but especially by marianne who showed more warmth of 
regard in her reception of him than even elinor herself 
to marianne indeed the meeting between edward and her sister 
was but a continuation of that unaccountable coldness which she 
had often observed at norland in their mutual behaviour 
on edward s side more particularly there was a deficiency 
of all that a lover ought to look and say on such an occasion 
he was confused seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure 
in seeing them looked neither rapturous nor gay 
said little but what was forced from him by questions 
and distinguished elinor by no mark of affection 
marianne saw and listened with increasing surprise 
she began almost to feel a dislike of edward and it ended 
as every feeling must end with her by carrying back her 
thoughts to willoughby whose manners formed a contrast 
sufficiently striking to those of his brother elect 
after a short silence which succeeded the first 
surprise and enquiries of meeting marianne asked 
edward if he came directly from london no he had 
been in devonshire a fortnight 
a fortnight she repeated surprised at his being 
so long in the same county with elinor without seeing 
her before 
he looked rather distressed as he added that he 
had been staying with some friends near plymouth 
have you been lately in sussex said elinor 
i was at norland about a month ago 
and how does dear dear norland look cried marianne 
dear dear norland said elinor probably looks 
much as it always does at this time of the year 
the woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves 
oh cried marianne with what transporting sensation 
have i formerly seen them fall how have i delighted 
as i walked to see them driven in showers about me 
by the wind what feelings have they the season the air 
altogether inspired now there is no one to regard them 
they are seen only as a nuisance swept hastily off 
and driven as much as possible from the sight 
it is not every one said elinor who has your 
passion for dead leaves 
no my feelings are not often shared not often 
understood but sometimes they are as she said this 
she sunk into a reverie for a few moments but rousing 
herself again now edward said she calling his attention 
to the prospect here is barton valley look up to it 
and be tranquil if you can look at those hills 
did you ever see their equals to the left is barton park 
amongst those woods and plantations you may see the end 
of the house and there beneath that farthest hill 
which rises with such grandeur is our cottage 
it is a beautiful country he replied but these 
bottoms must be dirty in winter 
how can you think of dirt with such objects before you 
because replied he smiling among the rest of the 
objects before me i see a very dirty lane 
how strange said marianne to herself as she walked on 
have you an agreeable neighbourhood here are the 
middletons pleasant people 
no not all answered marianne we could not 
be more unfortunately situated 
marianne cried her sister how can you say so how can 
you be so unjust they are a very respectable family mr 
ferrars 
and towards us have behaved in the friendliest manner have you 
forgot marianne how many pleasant days we have owed to them 
no said marianne in a low voice nor how many 
painful moments 
elinor took no notice of this and directing 
her attention to their visitor endeavoured to support 
something like discourse with him by talking of their 
present residence its conveniences c extorting from him 
occasional questions and remarks his coldness and reserve 
mortified her severely she was vexed and half angry 
but resolving to regulate her behaviour to him by the past 
rather than the present she avoided every appearance 
of resentment or displeasure and treated him as she 
thought he ought to be treated from the family connection 
chapter 
mrs dashwood was surprised only for a moment at 
seeing him for his coming to barton was in her opinion 
of all things the most natural her joy and expression 
of regard long outlived her wonder he received the kindest 
welcome from her and shyness coldness reserve could not 
stand against such a reception they had begun to fail him 
before he entered the house and they were quite overcome 
by the captivating manners of mrs dashwood indeed a man 
could not very well be in love with either of her daughters 
without extending the passion to her and elinor had the 
satisfaction of seeing him soon become more like himself 
his affections seemed to reanimate towards them all 
and his interest in their welfare again became perceptible 
he was not in spirits however he praised their house 
admired its prospect was attentive and kind but still 
he was not in spirits the whole family perceived it 
and mrs dashwood attributing it to some want of liberality 
in his mother sat down to table indignant against all 
selfish parents 
what are mrs ferrars s views for you at present edward 
said she when dinner was over and they had drawn round 
the fire are you still to be a great orator in spite of 
yourself 
no i hope my mother is now convinced that i have 
no more talents than inclination for a public life 
but how is your fame to be established for famous you 
must be to satisfy all your family and with no inclination 
for expense no affection for strangers no profession 
and no assurance you may find it a difficult matter 
i shall not attempt it i have no wish to be 
distinguished and have every reason to hope i never shall 
thank heaven i cannot be forced into genius and eloquence 
you have no ambition i well know your wishes 
are all moderate 
as moderate as those of the rest of the world 
i believe i wish as well as every body else to be 
perfectly happy but like every body else it must be 
in my own way greatness will not make me so 
strange that it would cried marianne what have 
wealth or grandeur to do with happiness 
grandeur has but little said elinor but wealth 
has much to do with it 
elinor for shame said marianne money can only 
give happiness where there is nothing else to give it 
beyond a competence it can afford no real satisfaction 
as far as mere self is concerned 
perhaps said elinor smiling we may come 
to the same point your competence and my wealth 
are very much alike i dare say and without them 
as the world goes now we shall both agree that every 
kind of external comfort must be wanting your ideas 
are only more noble than mine come what is your competence 
about eighteen hundred or two thousand a year 
not more than that 
elinor laughed two thousand a year one is my 
wealth i guessed how it would end 
and yet two thousand a year is a very moderate income 
said marianne a family cannot well be maintained on 
a smaller i am sure i am not extravagant in my demands 
a proper establishment of servants a carriage perhaps two 
and hunters cannot be supported on less 
elinor smiled again to hear her sister describing 
so accurately their future expenses at combe magna 
hunters repeated edward but why must you have 
hunters every body does not hunt 
marianne coloured as she replied but most people do 
i wish said margaret striking out a novel thought 
that somebody would give us all a large fortune apiece 
oh that they would cried marianne her eyes 
sparkling with animation and her cheeks glowing 
with the delight of such imaginary happiness 
we are all unanimous in that wish i suppose 
said elinor in spite of the insufficiency of wealth 
oh dear cried margaret how happy i should be 
i wonder what i should do with it 
marianne looked as if she had no doubt on that point 
i should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself 
said mrs dashwood if my children were all to be rich 
my help 
you must begin your improvements on this house 
observed elinor and your difficulties will soon vanish 
what magnificent orders would travel from this family 
to london said edward in such an event what a happy 
day for booksellers music sellers and print shops you 
miss dashwood would give a general commission for every 
new print of merit to be sent you and as for marianne 
i know her greatness of soul there would not be music enough 
in london to content her and books thomson cowper 
scott she would buy them all over and over again she 
would buy up every copy i believe to prevent their 
falling into unworthy hands and she would have every 
book that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree 
should not you marianne forgive me if i am very saucy 
but i was willing to shew you that i had not forgot our 
old disputes 
i love to be reminded of the past edward whether it 
be melancholy or gay i love to recall it and you 
will never offend me by talking of former times 
you are very right in supposing how my money would be 
spent some of it at least my loose cash would certainly 
be employed in improving my collection of music and books 
and the bulk of your fortune would be laid out 
in annuities on the authors or their heirs 
no edward i should have something else to do 
with it 
perhaps then you would bestow it as a reward on that 
person who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim 
that no one can ever be in love more than once in their 
life your opinion on that point is unchanged i presume 
undoubtedly at my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed 
it is not likely that i should now see or hear any thing to 
change them 
marianne is as steadfast as ever you see said elinor 
she is not at all altered 
she is only grown a little more grave than she was 
nay edward said marianne you need not reproach me 
you are not very gay yourself 
why should you think so replied he with a sigh 
but gaiety never was a part of my character 
nor do i think it a part of marianne s said elinor 
i should hardly call her a lively girl she is very earnest 
very eager in all she does sometimes talks a great deal 
and always with animation but she is not often really merry 
i believe you are right he replied and yet i 
have always set her down as a lively girl 
i have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes 
said elinor in a total misapprehension of character in some 
point or other fancying people so much more gay or grave 
or ingenious or stupid than they really are and i can 
hardly tell why or in what the deception originated 
sometimes one is guided by what they say of themselves 
and very frequently by what other people say of them 
without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge 
but i thought it was right elinor said marianne 
to be guided wholly by the opinion of other people 
i thought our judgments were given us merely to be subservient 
to those of neighbours this has always been your doctrine 
i am sure 
no marianne never my doctrine has never aimed 
at the subjection of the understanding all i have 
ever attempted to influence has been the behaviour 
you must not confound my meaning i am guilty i confess 
of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance 
in general with greater attention but when have i advised 
you to adopt their sentiments or to conform to their 
judgment in serious matters 
you have not been able to bring your sister over to your 
plan of general civility said edward to elinor do you gain 
no ground 
quite the contrary replied elinor 
looking expressively at marianne 
my judgment he returned is all on your side 
of the question but i am afraid my practice is much 
more on your sister s i never wish to offend but i 
am so foolishly shy that i often seem negligent 
when i am only kept back by my natural awkwardness 
i have frequently thought that i must have been intended 
by nature to be fond of low company i am so little at 
my ease among strangers of gentility 
marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention 
of hers said elinor 
she knows her own worth too well for false shame 
replied edward shyness is only the effect of a sense 
of inferiority in some way or other if i could persuade 
myself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful 
i should not be shy 
but you would still be reserved said marianne 
and that is worse 
edward started reserved am i reserved marianne 
yes very 
i do not understand you replied he colouring 
reserved how in what manner what am i to tell you 
what can you suppose 
elinor looked surprised at his emotion but trying 
to laugh off the subject she said to him do not you 
know my sister well enough to understand what she means 
do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not 
talk as fast and admire what she admires as rapturously 
as herself 
edward made no answer his gravity and thoughtfulness 
returned on him in their fullest extent and he sat 
for some time silent and dull 
chapter 
elinor saw with great uneasiness the low spirits 
of her friend his visit afforded her but a very 
partial satisfaction while his own enjoyment in it 
appeared so imperfect it was evident that he was unhappy 
she wished it were equally evident that he still 
distinguished her by the same affection which once 
she had felt no doubt of inspiring but hitherto the 
continuance of his preference seemed very uncertain 
and the reservedness of his manner towards her contradicted 
one moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding 
one 
he joined her and marianne in the breakfast room 
the next morning before the others were down and marianne 
who was always eager to promote their happiness as far 
as she could soon left them to themselves but before she 
was half way upstairs she heard the parlour door open and 
turning round was astonished to see edward himself come out 
i am going into the village to see my horses 
said be as you are not yet ready for breakfast i shall 
be back again presently 
edward returned to them with fresh admiration 
of the surrounding country in his walk to the village 
he had seen many parts of the valley to advantage 
and the village itself in a much higher situation than 
the cottage afforded a general view of the whole which had 
exceedingly pleased him this was a subject which ensured 
marianne s attention and she was beginning to describe 
her own admiration of these scenes and to question him more 
minutely on the objects that had particularly struck him 
when edward interrupted her by saying you must not 
enquire too far marianne remember i have no knowledge 
in the picturesque and i shall offend you by my ignorance 
and want of taste if we come to particulars i shall call 
hills steep which ought to be bold surfaces strange 
and uncouth which ought to be irregular and rugged 
and distant objects out of sight which ought only to be 
indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere 
you must be satisfied with such admiration as i can 
honestly give i call it a very fine country the 
hills are steep the woods seem full of fine timber 
and the valley looks comfortable and snug with rich 
meadows and several neat farm houses scattered here 
and there it exactly answers my idea of a fine country 
because it unites beauty with utility and i dare say it 
is a picturesque one too because you admire it i can 
easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories 
grey moss and brush wood but these are all lost on me 
i know nothing of the picturesque 
i am afraid it is but too true said marianne 
but why should you boast of it 
i suspect said elinor that to avoid one kind 
of affectation edward here falls into another because he 
believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties 
of nature than they really feel and is disgusted with 
such pretensions he affects greater indifference and less 
discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses 
he is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own 
it is very true said marianne that admiration 
of landscape scenery is become a mere jargon 
every body pretends to feel and tries to describe with 
the taste and elegance of him who first defined what 
picturesque beauty was i detest jargon of every kind 
and sometimes i have kept my feelings to myself 
because i could find no language to describe them 
in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning 
i am convinced said edward that you really feel 
all the delight in a fine prospect which you profess 
to feel but in return your sister must allow me 
to feel no more than i profess i like a fine prospect 
but not on picturesque principles i do not like crooked 
twisted blasted trees i admire them much more if they 
are tall straight and flourishing i do not like ruined 
tattered cottages i am not fond of nettles or thistles 
or heath blossoms i have more pleasure in a snug 
farm house than a watch tower and a troop of tidy 
happy villages please me better than the finest banditti 
in the world 
marianne looked with amazement at edward 
with compassion at her sister elinor only laughed 
the subject was continued no farther and marianne 
remained thoughtfully silent till a new object suddenly 
engaged her attention she was sitting by edward and 
in taking his tea from mrs dashwood his hand passed 
so directly before her as to make a ring with a plait 
of hair in the centre very conspicuous on one of his fingers 
i never saw you wear a ring before edward she cried 
is that fanny s hair i remember her promising to give 
you some but i should have thought her hair had been darker 
marianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt 
but when she saw how much she had pained edward her own 
vexation at her want of thought could not be surpassed 
by his he coloured very deeply and giving a momentary 
glance at elinor replied yes it is my sister s hair 
the setting always casts a different shade on it 
you know 
elinor had met his eye and looked conscious likewise 
that the hair was her own she instantaneously felt as 
well satisfied as marianne the only difference in their 
conclusions was that what marianne considered as a free 
gift from her sister elinor was conscious must have been 
procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself 
she was not in a humour however to regard it as an affront 
and affecting to take no notice of what passed 
by instantly talking of something else she internally 
resolved henceforward to catch every opportunity of eyeing 
the hair and of satisfying herself beyond all doubt 
that it was exactly the shade of her own 
edward s embarrassment lasted some time and it 
ended in an absence of mind still more settled 
he was particularly grave the whole morning 
marianne severely censured herself for what she had said 
but her own forgiveness might have been more speedy 
had she known how little offence it had given her sister 
before the middle of the day they were visited by sir 
john and mrs jennings who having heard of the arrival 
of a gentleman at the cottage came to take a survey 
of the guest with the assistance of his mother in law 
sir john was not long in discovering that the name of 
ferrars began with an f and this prepared a future mine 
of raillery against the devoted elinor which nothing but 
the newness of their acquaintance with edward could have 
prevented from being immediately sprung but as it was 
she only learned from some very significant looks how far 
their penetration founded on margaret s instructions extended 
sir john never came to the dashwoods without either 
inviting them to dine at the park the next day or to drink 
tea with them that evening on the present occasion 
for the better entertainment of their visitor towards 
whose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute 
he wished to engage them for both 
you must drink tea with us to night said he 
for we shall be quite alone and tomorrow you must 
absolutely dine with us for we shall be a large party 
mrs jennings enforced the necessity and who knows 
but you may raise a dance said she and that will 
tempt you miss marianne 
a dance cried marianne impossible who is to dance 
who why yourselves and the careys and whitakers 
to be sure what you thought nobody could dance 
because a certain person that shall be nameless is gone 
i wish with all my soul cried sir john 
that willoughby were among us again 
this and marianne s blushing gave new suspicions 
to edward and who is willoughby said he in a low voice 
to miss dashwood by whom he was sitting 
she gave him a brief reply marianne s countenance 
was more communicative edward saw enough to comprehend 
not only the meaning of others but such of marianne s 
expressions as had puzzled him before and when their 
visitors left them he went immediately round her and said 
in a whisper i have been guessing shall i tell you 
my guess 
what do you mean 
shall i tell you 
certainly 
well then i guess that mr willoughby hunts 
marianne was surprised and confused yet she could 
not help smiling at the quiet archness of his manner 
and after a moment s silence said 
oh edward how can you but the time will come 
i hope i am sure you will like him 
i do not doubt it replied he rather astonished 
at her earnestness and warmth for had he not imagined it 
to be a joke for the good of her acquaintance in general 
founded only on a something or a nothing between mr willoughby 
and herself he would not have ventured to mention it 
chapter 
edward remained a week at the cottage he was earnestly 
pressed by mrs dashwood to stay longer but as if he 
were bent only on self mortification he seemed resolved 
to be gone when his enjoyment among his friends was at 
the height his spirits during the last two or three days 
though still very unequal were greatly improved he grew 
more and more partial to the house and environs never 
spoke of going away without a sigh declared his time 
to be wholly disengaged even doubted to what place he 
should go when he left them but still go he must 
never had any week passed so quickly he could hardly 
believe it to be gone he said so repeatedly other things 
he said too which marked the turn of his feelings and gave 
the lie to his actions he had no pleasure at norland 
he detested being in town but either to norland or london 
he must go he valued their kindness beyond any thing 
and his greatest happiness was in being with them 
yet he must leave them at the end of a week in spite 
of their wishes and his own and without any restraint 
on his time 
elinor placed all that was astonishing in this 
way of acting to his mother s account and it was 
happy for her that he had a mother whose character 
was so imperfectly known to her as to be the general 
excuse for every thing strange on the part of her son 
disappointed however and vexed as she was and sometimes 
displeased with his uncertain behaviour to herself 
she was very well disposed on the whole to regard his actions 
with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications 
which had been rather more painfully extorted from her 
for willoughby s service by her mother his want of spirits 
of openness and of consistency were most usually 
attributed to his want of independence and his better 
knowledge of mrs ferrars s disposition and designs 
the shortness of his visit the steadiness of his purpose 
in leaving them originated in the same fettered inclination 
the same inevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother 
the old well established grievance of duty against will 
parent against child was the because of all she would have 
been glad to know when these difficulties were to cease 
this opposition was to yield when mrs ferrars would 
be reformed and her son be at liberty to be happy 
but from such vain wishes she was forced to turn for comfort 
to the renewal of her confidence in edward s affection 
to the remembrance of every mark of regard in look or word 
which fell from him while at barton and above all 
to that flattering proof of it which he constantly wore 
round his finger 
i think edward said mrs dashwood as they were 
at breakfast the last morning you would be a happier man 
if you had any profession to engage your time and give 
an interest to your plans and actions some inconvenience 
to your friends indeed might result from it you 
would not be able to give them so much of your time 
but with a smile you would be materially benefited 
in one particular at least you would know where to go 
when you left them 
i do assure you he replied that i have long 
thought on this point as you think now it has been 
and is and probably will always be a heavy misfortune 
to me that i have had no necessary business to engage me 
no profession to give me employment or afford me any 
thing like independence but unfortunately my own nicety 
and the nicety of my friends have made me what i am 
an idle helpless being we never could agree in our 
choice of a profession i always preferred the church 
as i still do but that was not smart enough for my family 
they recommended the army that was a great deal 
too smart for me the law was allowed to be genteel 
enough many young men who had chambers in the temple 
made a very good appearance in the first circles 
and drove about town in very knowing gigs but i had 
no inclination for the law even in this less abstruse 
study of it which my family approved as for the navy 
it had fashion on its side but i was too old when the 
subject was first started to enter it and at length 
as there was no necessity for my having any profession 
at all as i might be as dashing and expensive without 
a red coat on my back as with one idleness was pronounced 
on the whole to be most advantageous and honourable 
and a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly 
bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his 
friends to do nothing i was therefore entered at oxford 
and have been properly idle ever since 
the consequence of which i suppose will be 
said mrs dashwood since leisure has not promoted 
your own happiness that your sons will be brought up 
to as many pursuits employments professions and trades 
as columella s 
they will be brought up said he in a serious accent 
to be as unlike myself as is possible in feeling 
in action in condition in every thing 
come come this is all an effusion of immediate 
want of spirits edward you are in a melancholy humour 
and fancy that any one unlike yourself must be happy 
but remember that the pain of parting from friends 
will be felt by every body at times whatever be their 
education or state know your own happiness you want 
nothing but patience or give it a more fascinating name 
call it hope your mother will secure to you in time 
that independence you are so anxious for it is her duty 
and it will it must ere long become her happiness to 
prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent 
how much may not a few months do 
i think replied edward that i may defy many 
months to produce any good to me 
this desponding turn of mind though it could not 
be communicated to mrs dashwood gave additional pain 
to them all in the parting which shortly took place 
and left an uncomfortable impression on elinor s 
feelings especially which required some trouble and time 
to subdue but as it was her determination to subdue it 
and to prevent herself from appearing to suffer more than 
what all her family suffered on his going away she did 
not adopt the method so judiciously employed by marianne 
on a similar occasion to augment and fix her sorrow 
by seeking silence solitude and idleness their means 
were as different as their objects and equally suited 
to the advancement of each 
elinor sat down to her drawing table as soon as he 
was out of the house busily employed herself the whole day 
neither sought nor avoided the mention of his name 
appeared to interest herself almost as much as ever in the 
general concerns of the family and if by this conduct 
she did not lessen her own grief it was at least prevented 
from unnecessary increase and her mother and sisters 
were spared much solicitude on her account 
such behaviour as this so exactly the reverse 
of her own appeared no more meritorious to marianne 
than her own had seemed faulty to her the business 
of self command she settled very easily with strong 
affections it was impossible with calm ones it could 
have no merit that her sister s affections were calm 
she dared not deny though she blushed to acknowledge it 
and of the strength of her own she gave a very striking proof 
by still loving and respecting that sister in spite 
of this mortifying conviction 
without shutting herself up from her family 
or leaving the house in determined solitude to avoid them 
or lying awake the whole night to indulge meditation 
elinor found every day afforded her leisure enough 
to think of edward and of edward s behaviour in every 
possible variety which the different state of her spirits 
at different times could produce with tenderness 
pity approbation censure and doubt there were moments 
in abundance when if not by the absence of her mother 
and sisters at least by the nature of their employments 
conversation was forbidden among them and every effect 
of solitude was produced her mind was inevitably 
at liberty her thoughts could not be chained elsewhere 
and the past and the future on a subject so interesting 
must be before her must force her attention and engross 
her memory her reflection and her fancy 
from a reverie of this kind as she sat at her 
drawing table she was roused one morning soon after 
edward s leaving them by the arrival of company 
she happened to be quite alone the closing of the 
little gate at the entrance of the green court in front 
of the house drew her eyes to the window and she saw 
a large party walking up to the door amongst them 
were sir john and lady middleton and mrs jennings 
but there were two others a gentleman and lady who were 
quite unknown to her she was sitting near the window 
and as soon as sir john perceived her he left the rest 
of the party to the ceremony of knocking at the door 
and stepping across the turf obliged her to open the 
casement to speak to him though the space was so short 
between the door and the window as to make it hardly 
possible to speak at one without being heard at the other 
well said he we have brought you some strangers 
how do you like them 
hush they will hear you 
never mind if they do it is only the palmers 
charlotte is very pretty i can tell you you may see her 
if you look this way 
as elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple 
of minutes without taking that liberty she begged 
to be excused 
where is marianne has she run away because we 
are come i see her instrument is open 
she is walking i believe 
they were now joined by mrs jennings who had not 
patience enough to wait till the door was opened before 
she told her story she came hallooing to the window 
how do you do my dear how does mrs dashwood do 
and where are your sisters what all alone you 
will be glad of a little company to sit with you 
i have brought my other son and daughter to see you 
only think of their coming so suddenly i thought i heard 
a carriage last night while we were drinking our tea 
but it never entered my head that it could be them 
i thought of nothing but whether it might not be colonel 
brandon come back again so i said to sir john i do think 
i hear a carriage perhaps it is colonel brandon come 
back again 
elinor was obliged to turn from her in the middle 
of her story to receive the rest of the party lady 
middleton introduced the two strangers mrs dashwood 
and margaret came down stairs at the same time and they 
all sat down to look at one another while mrs jennings 
continued her story as she walked through the passage 
into the parlour attended by sir john 
mrs palmer was several years younger than lady 
middleton and totally unlike her in every respect 
she was short and plump had a very pretty face 
and the finest expression of good humour in it that could 
possibly be her manners were by no means so elegant 
as her sister s but they were much more prepossessing 
she came in with a smile smiled all the time of her visit 
except when she laughed and smiled when she went away 
her husband was a grave looking young man of five or six 
and twenty with an air of more fashion and sense than 
his wife but of less willingness to please or be pleased 
he entered the room with a look of self consequence 
slightly bowed to the ladies without speaking a word 
and after briefly surveying them and their apartments 
took up a newspaper from the table and continued to read it 
as long as he staid 
mrs palmer on the contrary who was strongly endowed 
by nature with a turn for being uniformly civil and happy 
was hardly seated before her admiration of the parlour 
and every thing in it burst forth 
well what a delightful room this is i never 
saw anything so charming only think mamma how it 
is improved since i was here last i always thought it 
such a sweet place madam turning to mrs dashwood 
but you have made it so charming only look sister 
how delightful every thing is how i should like such 
a house for myself should not you mr palmer 
mr palmer made her no answer and did not even raise 
his eyes from the newspaper 
mr palmer does not hear me said she laughing 
he never does sometimes it is so ridiculous 
this was quite a new idea to mrs dashwood she had 
never been used to find wit in the inattention of any one 
and could not help looking with surprise at them both 
mrs jennings in the meantime talked on as loud 
as she could and continued her account of their surprise 
the evening before on seeing their friends without 
ceasing till every thing was told mrs palmer laughed 
heartily at the recollection of their astonishment 
and every body agreed two or three times over that it 
had been quite an agreeable surprise 
you may believe how glad we all were to see them 
added mrs jennings leaning forward towards elinor 
and speaking in a low voice as if she meant to be heard 
by no one else though they were seated on different sides 
of the room but however i cannot help wishing they had 
not travelled quite so fast nor made such a long journey 
of it for they came all round by london upon account 
of some business for you know nodding significantly and 
pointing to her daughter it was wrong in her situation 
i wanted her to stay at home and rest this morning 
but she would come with us she longed so much to see 
you all 
mrs palmer laughed and said it would not do her 
any harm 
she expects to be confined in february 
continued mrs jennings 
lady middleton could no longer endure such a conversation 
and therefore exerted herself to ask mr palmer if there 
was any news in the paper 
no none at all he replied and read on 
here comes marianne cried sir john now palmer 
you shall see a monstrous pretty girl 
he immediately went into the passage opened the front door 
and ushered her in himself mrs jennings asked her 
as soon as she appeared if she had not been to allenham 
and mrs palmer laughed so heartily at the question 
as to show she understood it mr palmer looked up 
on her entering the room stared at her some minutes 
and then returned to his newspaper mrs palmer s eye 
was now caught by the drawings which hung round the room 
she got up to examine them 
oh dear how beautiful these are well how delightful 
do but look mama how sweet i declare they are quite charming 
i could look at them for ever and then sitting down again 
she very soon forgot that there were any such things in the room 
when lady middleton rose to go away mr palmer 
rose also laid down the newspaper stretched himself 
and looked at them all around 
my love have you been asleep said his wife laughing 
he made her no answer and only observed after again 
examining the room that it was very low pitched 
and that the ceiling was crooked he then made his bow 
and departed with the rest 
sir john had been very urgent with them all to 
spend the next day at the park mrs dashwood who did 
not chuse to dine with them oftener than they dined 
at the cottage absolutely refused on her own account 
her daughters might do as they pleased but they had no 
curiosity to see how mr and mrs palmer ate their dinner 
and no expectation of pleasure from them in any other way 
they attempted therefore likewise to excuse themselves 
the weather was uncertain and not likely to be good 
but sir john would not be satisfied the carriage should 
be sent for them and they must come lady middleton too 
though she did not press their mother pressed them 
mrs jennings and mrs palmer joined their entreaties all 
seemed equally anxious to avoid a family party and the young 
ladies were obliged to yield 
why should they ask us said marianne as soon as they 
were gone the rent of this cottage is said to be low 
but we have it on very hard terms if we are to dine 
at the park whenever any one is staying either with them 
or with us 
they mean no less to be civil and kind to us now 
said elinor by these frequent invitations than by 
those which we received from them a few weeks ago 
the alteration is not in them if their parties are grown 
tedious and dull we must look for the change elsewhere 
chapter 
as the miss dashwoods entered the drawing room of the park 
the next day at one door mrs palmer came running in at 
the other looking as good humoured and merry as before 
she took them all most affectionately by the hand 
and expressed great delight in seeing them again 
i am so glad to see you said she seating herself 
between elinor and marianne for it is so bad a day i was 
afraid you might not come which would be a shocking thing 
as we go away again tomorrow we must go for the westons 
come to us next week you know it was quite a sudden thing 
our coming at all and i knew nothing of it till the carriage 
was coming to the door and then mr palmer asked me if i 
would go with him to barton he is so droll he never 
tells me any thing i am so sorry we cannot stay longer 
however we shall meet again in town very soon i hope 
they were obliged to put an end to such an expectation 
not go to town cried mrs palmer with a laugh 
i shall be quite disappointed if you do not i could 
get the nicest house in world for you next door to ours 
in hanover square you must come indeed i am sure 
i shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till 
i am confined if mrs dashwood should not like to go 
into public 
they thanked her but were obliged to resist all 
her entreaties 
oh my love cried mrs palmer to her husband 
who just then entered the room you must help me to 
persuade the miss dashwoods to go to town this winter 
her love made no answer and after slightly bowing 
to the ladies began complaining of the weather 
how horrid all this is said he such weather 
makes every thing and every body disgusting dullness 
is as much produced within doors as without by rain 
it makes one detest all one s acquaintance what the 
devil does sir john mean by not having a billiard room 
in his house how few people know what comfort is sir 
john is as stupid as the weather 
the rest of the company soon dropt in 
i am afraid miss marianne said sir john you have 
not been able to take your usual walk to allenham today 
marianne looked very grave and said nothing 
oh do not be so sly before us said mrs palmer 
for we know all about it i assure you and i admire your 
taste very much for i think he is extremely handsome 
we do not live a great way from him in the country you know 
not above ten miles i dare say 
much nearer thirty said her husband 
ah well there is not much difference 
i never was at his house but they say it is a sweet 
pretty place 
as vile a spot as i ever saw in my life 
said mr palmer 
marianne remained perfectly silent though her 
countenance betrayed her interest in what was said 
is it very ugly continued mrs palmer then it 
must be some other place that is so pretty i suppose 
when they were seated in the dining room sir john 
observed with regret that they were only eight all together 
my dear said he to his lady it is very provoking 
that we should be so few why did not you ask the gilberts 
to come to us today 
did not i tell you sir john when you spoke to me 
about it before that it could not be done they dined 
with us last 
you and i sir john said mrs jennings 
should not stand upon such ceremony 
then you would be very ill bred cried mr palmer 
my love you contradict every body said his wife 
with her usual laugh do you know that you are quite rude 
i did not know i contradicted any body in calling 
your mother ill bred 
ay you may abuse me as you please said the good natured 
old lady you have taken charlotte off my hands and cannot 
give her back again so there i have the whip hand of you 
charlotte laughed heartily to think that her 
husband could not get rid of her and exultingly said 
she did not care how cross he was to her as they must 
live together it was impossible for any one to be more 
thoroughly good natured or more determined to be happy 
than mrs palmer the studied indifference insolence 
and discontent of her husband gave her no pain 
and when he scolded or abused her she was highly diverted 
mr palmer is so droll said she in a whisper 
to elinor he is always out of humour 
elinor was not inclined after a little observation 
to give him credit for being so genuinely and unaffectedly 
ill natured or ill bred as he wished to appear 
his temper might perhaps be a little soured by finding 
like many others of his sex that through some unaccountable 
bias in favour of beauty he was the husband of a very silly 
woman but she knew that this kind of blunder was too 
common for any sensible man to be lastingly hurt by it 
it was rather a wish of distinction she believed 
which produced his contemptuous treatment of every body 
and his general abuse of every thing before him 
it was the desire of appearing superior to other people 
the motive was too common to be wondered at but the means 
however they might succeed by establishing his superiority 
in ill breeding were not likely to attach any one to him 
except his wife 
oh my dear miss dashwood said mrs palmer soon afterwards 
i have got such a favour to ask of you and your sister 
will you come and spend some time at cleveland this 
christmas now pray do and come while the westons are 
with us you cannot think how happy i shall be it will 
be quite delightful my love applying to her husband 
do not you long to have the miss dashwoods come to cleveland 
certainly he replied with a sneer i came 
into devonshire with no other view 
there now said his lady you see mr palmer 
expects you so you cannot refuse to come 
they both eagerly and resolutely declined her invitation 
but indeed you must and shall come i am sure you 
will like it of all things the westons will be with us 
and it will be quite delightful you cannot think 
what a sweet place cleveland is and we are so gay now 
for mr palmer is always going about the country canvassing 
against the election and so many people came to dine 
with us that i never saw before it is quite charming but 
poor fellow it is very fatiguing to him for he is forced 
to make every body like him 
elinor could hardly keep her countenance as she 
assented to the hardship of such an obligation 
how charming it will be said charlotte when he 
is in parliament will not it how i shall laugh it will 
be so ridiculous to see all his letters directed to him 
with an m p but do you know he says he will never frank 
for me he declares he will not do not you mr palmer 
mr palmer took no notice of her 
he cannot bear writing you know she continued 
he says it is quite shocking 
no said he i never said any thing so irrational 
do not palm all your abuses of languages upon me 
there now you see how droll he is this is always 
the way with him sometimes he will not speak to me for half 
a day together and then he comes out with something 
so droll all about any thing in the world 
she surprised elinor very much as they returned 
into the drawing room by asking her whether she did 
not like mr palmer excessively 
certainly said elinor he seems very agreeable 
well i am so glad you do i thought you would 
he is so pleasant and mr palmer is excessively pleased 
with you and your sisters i can tell you and you cannot 
think how disappointed he will be if you do not come 
to cleveland i cannot imagine why you should object 
to it 
elinor was again obliged to decline her invitation 
and by changing the subject put a stop to her entreaties 
she thought it probable that as they lived in the 
same county mrs palmer might be able to give some 
more particular account of willoughby s general 
character than could be gathered from the middletons 
partial acquaintance with him and she was eager to gain 
from any one such a confirmation of his merits as might 
remove the possibility of fear from marianne she began 
by inquiring if they saw much of mr willoughby at cleveland 
and whether they were intimately acquainted with him 
oh dear yes i know him extremely well 
replied mrs palmer not that i ever spoke 
to him indeed but i have seen him for ever in town 
somehow or other i never happened to be staying at barton 
while he was at allenham mama saw him here once before 
but i was with my uncle at weymouth however i dare say 
we should have seen a great deal of him in somersetshire 
if it had not happened very unluckily that we should never 
have been in the country together he is very little 
at combe i believe but if he were ever so much there 
i do not think mr palmer would visit him for he is 
in the opposition you know and besides it is such a 
way off i know why you inquire about him very well 
your sister is to marry him i am monstrous glad of it 
for then i shall have her for a neighbour you know 
upon my word replied elinor you know much 
more of the matter than i do if you have any reason 
to expect such a match 
do not pretend to deny it because you know it is 
what every body talks of i assure you i heard of it 
in my way through town 
my dear mrs palmer 
upon my honour i did i met colonel brandon 
monday morning in bond street just before we left town 
and he told me of it directly 
you surprise me very much colonel brandon tell 
you of it surely you must be mistaken to give such 
intelligence to a person who could not be interested in it 
even if it were true is not what i should expect colonel 
brandon to do 
but i do assure you it was so for all that 
and i will tell you how it happened when we met him 
he turned back and walked with us and so we began talking 
of my brother and sister and one thing and another 
and i said to him so colonel there is a new family 
come to barton cottage i hear and mama sends me word 
they are very pretty and that one of them is going to be 
married to mr willoughby of combe magna is it true 
pray for of course you must know as you have been in 
devonshire so lately 
and what did the colonel say 
oh he did not say much but he looked as if he 
knew it to be true so from that moment i set it down 
as certain it will be quite delightful i declare 
when is it to take place 
mr brandon was very well i hope 
oh yes quite well and so full of your praises 
he did nothing but say fine things of you 
i am flattered by his commendation he seems 
an excellent man and i think him uncommonly pleasing 
so do i he is such a charming man that it 
is quite a pity he should be so grave and so dull 
mamma says he was in love with your sister too 
i assure you it was a great compliment if he was for he 
hardly ever falls in love with any body 
is mr willoughby much known in your part 
of somersetshire said elinor 
oh yes extremely well that is i do not believe 
many people are acquainted with him because combe magna 
is so far off but they all think him extremely agreeable 
i assure you nobody is more liked than mr willoughby 
wherever he goes and so you may tell your sister 
she is a monstrous lucky girl to get him upon my honour 
not but that he is much more lucky in getting her 
because she is so very handsome and agreeable that nothing 
can be good enough for her however i do not think 
her hardly at all handsomer than you i assure you 
for i think you both excessively pretty and so does 
mr palmer too i am sure though we could not get him 
to own it last night 
mrs palmer s information respecting willoughby 
was not very material but any testimony in his favour 
however small was pleasing to her 
i am so glad we are got acquainted at last 
continued charlotte and now i hope we shall always be 
great friends you cannot think how much i longed to see you 
it is so delightful that you should live at the cottage 
nothing can be like it to be sure and i am so glad 
your sister is going to be well married i hope you will 
be a great deal at combe magna it is a sweet place 
by all accounts 
you have been long acquainted with colonel brandon 
have not you 
yes a great while ever since my sister married 
he was a particular friend of sir john s i believe 
she added in a low voice he would have been very 
glad to have had me if he could sir john and lady 
middleton wished it very much but mama did not think 
the match good enough for me otherwise sir john would 
have mentioned it to the colonel and we should have been 
married immediately 
did not colonel brandon know of sir john s proposal 
to your mother before it was made had he never owned 
his affection to yourself 
oh no but if mama had not objected to it 
i dare say he would have liked it of all things 
he had not seen me then above twice for it was before 
i left school however i am much happier as i am 
mr palmer is the kind of man i like 
chapter 
the palmers returned to cleveland the next day 
and the two families at barton were again left to entertain 
each other but this did not last long elinor had hardly 
got their last visitors out of her head had hardly done 
wondering at charlotte s being so happy without a because 
at mr palmer s acting so simply with good abilities 
and at the strange unsuitableness which often existed between 
husband and wife before sir john s and mrs jennings s 
active zeal in the because of society procured her some 
other new acquaintance to see and observe 
in a morning s excursion to exeter they had met with 
two young ladies whom mrs jennings had the satisfaction 
of discovering to be her relations and this was enough 
for sir john to invite them directly to the park 
as soon as their present engagements at exeter were over 
their engagements at exeter instantly gave way before 
such an invitation and lady middleton was thrown into 
no little alarm on the return of sir john by hearing 
that she was very soon to receive a visit from two girls 
whom she had never seen in her life and of whose elegance 
whose tolerable gentility even she could have no proof 
for the assurances of her husband and mother on that subject 
went for nothing at all their being her relations too 
made it so much the worse and mrs jennings s attempts 
at consolation were therefore unfortunately founded 
when she advised her daughter not to care about their being 
so fashionable because they were all cousins and must put 
up with one another as it was impossible however now to 
prevent their coming lady middleton resigned herself to the 
idea of it with all the philosophy of a well bred woman 
contenting herself with merely giving her husband a gentle 
reprimand on the subject five or six times every day 
the young ladies arrived their appearance was by 
no means ungenteel or unfashionable their dress was 
very smart their manners very civil they were delighted 
with the house and in raptures with the furniture 
and they happened to be so doatingly fond of children 
that lady middleton s good opinion was engaged in their 
favour before they had been an hour at the park 
she declared them to be very agreeable girls indeed 
which for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration 
sir john s confidence in his own judgment rose with this 
animated praise and he set off directly for the cottage 
to tell the miss dashwoods of the miss steeles arrival 
and to assure them of their being the sweetest girls 
in the world from such commendation as this however 
there was not much to be learned elinor well knew 
that the sweetest girls in the world were to be met 
with in every part of england under every possible 
variation of form face temper and understanding 
sir john wanted the whole family to walk to the park directly 
and look at his guests benevolent philanthropic man it 
was painful to him even to keep a third cousin to himself 
do come now said he pray come you must come i 
declare you shall come you cannot think how you will 
like them lucy is monstrous pretty and so good humoured 
and agreeable the children are all hanging about her already 
as if she was an old acquaintance and they both long 
to see you of all things for they have heard at exeter 
that you are the most beautiful creatures in the world 
and i have told them it is all very true and a great 
deal more you will be delighted with them i am sure 
they have brought the whole coach full of playthings 
for the children how can you be so cross as not to come 
why they are your cousins you know after a fashion 
you are my cousins and they are my wife s so you must 
be related 
but sir john could not prevail he could only obtain 
a promise of their calling at the park within a day or two 
and then left them in amazement at their indifference 
to walk home and boast anew of their attractions to the 
miss steeles as he had been already boasting of the miss 
steeles to them 
when their promised visit to the park and consequent 
introduction to these young ladies took place they found 
in the appearance of the eldest who was nearly thirty 
with a very plain and not a sensible face nothing to admire 
but in the other who was not more than two or three 
and twenty they acknowledged considerable beauty her 
features were pretty and she had a sharp quick eye 
and a smartness of air which though it did not give 
actual elegance or grace gave distinction to her person 
their manners were particularly civil and elinor soon 
allowed them credit for some kind of sense when she 
saw with what constant and judicious attention they 
were making themselves agreeable to lady middleton 
with her children they were in continual raptures 
extolling their beauty courting their notice and humouring 
their whims and such of their time as could be spared from 
the importunate demands which this politeness made on it 
was spent in admiration of whatever her ladyship was doing 
if she happened to be doing any thing or in taking patterns 
of some elegant new dress in which her appearance 
the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight 
fortunately for those who pay their court through 
such foibles a fond mother though in pursuit of praise 
for her children the most rapacious of human beings 
is likewise the most credulous her demands are exorbitant 
but she will swallow any thing and the excessive 
affection and endurance of the miss steeles towards 
her offspring were viewed therefore by lady middleton 
without the smallest surprise or distrust she saw with 
maternal complacency all the impertinent encroachments 
and mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted 
she saw their sashes untied their hair pulled about 
their ears their work bags searched and their knives 
and scissors stolen away and felt no doubt of its being 
a reciprocal enjoyment it suggested no other surprise 
than that elinor and marianne should sit so composedly by 
without claiming a share in what was passing 
john is in such spirits today said she on his 
taking miss steeles s pocket handkerchief and throwing 
it out of window he is full of monkey tricks 
and soon afterwards on the second boy s violently 
pinching one of the same lady s fingers she fondly observed 
how playful william is 
and here is my sweet little annamaria she added 
tenderly caressing a little girl of three years old 
who had not made a noise for the last two minutes 
and she is always so gentle and quiet never was there 
such a quiet little thing 
but unfortunately in bestowing these embraces 
a pin in her ladyship s head dress slightly scratching 
the child s neck produced from this pattern of gentleness 
such violent screams as could hardly be outdone by any 
creature professedly noisy the mother s consternation 
was excessive but it could not surpass the alarm of the 
miss steeles and every thing was done by all three 
in so critical an emergency which affection could suggest 
as likely to assuage the agonies of the little sufferer 
she was seated in her mother s lap covered with kisses 
her wound bathed with lavender water by one of the 
miss steeles who was on her knees to attend her 
and her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by the other 
with such a reward for her tears the child was too wise 
to cease crying she still screamed and sobbed lustily 
kicked her two brothers for offering to touch her and all 
their united soothings were ineffectual till lady middleton 
luckily remembering that in a scene of similar distress 
last week some apricot marmalade had been successfully 
applied for a bruised temple the same remedy was eagerly 
proposed for this unfortunate scratch and a slight 
intermission of screams in the young lady on hearing it 
gave them reason to hope that it would not be rejected 
she was carried out of the room therefore in her 
mother s arms in quest of this medicine and as the 
two boys chose to follow though earnestly entreated 
by their mother to stay behind the four young ladies 
were left in a quietness which the room had not known for 
many hours 
poor little creatures said miss steele as soon 
as they were gone it might have been a very sad accident 
yet i hardly know how cried marianne unless it 
had been under totally different circumstances 
but this is the usual way of heightening alarm where there 
is nothing to be alarmed at in reality 
what a sweet woman lady middleton is said lucy steele 
marianne was silent it was impossible for her to say 
what she did not feel however trivial the occasion 
and upon elinor therefore the whole task of telling lies 
when politeness required it always fell she did her 
best when thus called on by speaking of lady middleton 
with more warmth than she felt though with far less than 
miss lucy 
and sir john too cried the elder sister 
what a charming man he is 
here too miss dashwood s commendation being only 
simple and just came in without any eclat she merely 
observed that he was perfectly good humoured and friendly 
and what a charming little family they have i 
never saw such fine children in my life i declare i 
quite doat upon them already and indeed i am always 
distractedly fond of children 
i should guess so said elinor with a smile 
from what i have witnessed this morning 
i have a notion said lucy you think the little 
middletons rather too much indulged perhaps they may be the 
outside of enough but it is so natural in lady middleton 
and for my part i love to see children full of life 
and spirits i cannot bear them if they are tame and quiet 
i confess replied elinor that while i am at 
barton park i never think of tame and quiet children 
with any abhorrence 
a short pause succeeded this speech which was first 
broken by miss steele who seemed very much disposed 
for conversation and who now said rather abruptly 
and how do you like devonshire miss dashwood i suppose 
you were very sorry to leave sussex 
in some surprise at the familiarity of this question 
or at least of the manner in which it was spoken 
elinor replied that she was 
norland is a prodigious beautiful place is not it 
added miss steele 
we have heard sir john admire it excessively 
said lucy who seemed to think some apology necessary 
for the freedom of her sister 
i think every one must admire it replied elinor 
who ever saw the place though it is not to be supposed 
that any one can estimate its beauties as we do 
and had you a great many smart beaux there i 
suppose you have not so many in this part of the world 
for my part i think they are a vast addition always 
but why should you think said lucy looking ashamed 
of her sister that there are not as many genteel young 
men in devonshire as sussex 
nay my dear i am sure i do not pretend to say that there 
an t i am sure there is a vast many smart beaux in exeter 
but you know how could i tell what smart beaux there 
might be about norland and i was only afraid the miss 
dashwoods might find it dull at barton if they had not 
so many as they used to have but perhaps you young ladies 
may not care about the beaux and had as lief be without 
them as with them for my part i think they are vastly 
agreeable provided they dress smart and behave civil 
but i cannot bear to see them dirty and nasty now there is 
mr rose at exeter a prodigious smart young man 
quite a beau clerk to mr simpson you know and yet if you 
do but meet him of a morning he is not fit to be seen 
i suppose your brother was quite a beau miss dashwood 
before he married as he was so rich 
upon my word replied elinor i cannot tell you 
for i do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word 
but this i can say that if he ever was a beau before 
he married he is one still for there is not the smallest 
alteration in him 
oh dear one never thinks of married men s being 
beaux they have something else to do 
lord anne cried her sister you can talk of 
nothing but beaux you will make miss dashwood believe you 
think of nothing else and then to turn the discourse 
she began admiring the house and the furniture 
this specimen of the miss steeles was enough 
the vulgar freedom and folly of the eldest left 
her no recommendation and as elinor was not blinded 
by the beauty or the shrewd look of the youngest 
to her want of real elegance and artlessness she left 
the house without any wish of knowing them better 
not so the miss steeles they came from exeter well 
provided with admiration for the use of sir john middleton 
his family and all his relations and no niggardly 
proportion was now dealt out to his fair cousins whom they 
declared to be the most beautiful elegant accomplished 
and agreeable girls they had ever beheld and with whom 
they were particularly anxious to be better acquainted 
and to be better acquainted therefore elinor soon found 
was their inevitable lot for as sir john was entirely 
on the side of the miss steeles their party would be 
too strong for opposition and that kind of intimacy 
must be submitted to which consists of sitting an hour 
or two together in the same room almost every day 
sir john could do no more but he did not know that any 
more was required to be together was in his opinion 
to be intimate and while his continual schemes for their 
meeting were effectual he had not a doubt of their being 
established friends 
to do him justice he did every thing in his power 
to promote their unreserve by making the miss steeles 
acquainted with whatever he knew or supposed of his cousins 
situations in the most delicate particulars and elinor 
had not seen them more than twice before the eldest of 
them wished her joy on her sister s having been so lucky 
as to make a conquest of a very smart beau since she 
came to barton 
twill be a fine thing to have her married so young 
to be sure said she and i hear he is quite a beau 
and prodigious handsome and i hope you may have as good 
luck yourself soon but perhaps you may have a friend 
in the corner already 
elinor could not suppose that sir john would be more 
nice in proclaiming his suspicions of her regard for edward 
than he had been with respect to marianne indeed it was 
rather his favourite joke of the two as being somewhat 
newer and more conjectural and since edward s visit 
they had never dined together without his drinking to her 
best affections with so much significancy and so many nods 
and winks as to excite general attention the letter f 
had been likewise invariably brought forward and found 
productive of such countless jokes that its character 
as the wittiest letter in the alphabet had been long 
established with elinor 
the miss steeles as she expected had now all the 
benefit of these jokes and in the eldest of them they 
raised a curiosity to know the name of the gentleman 
alluded to which though often impertinently expressed 
was perfectly of a piece with her general inquisitiveness 
into the concerns of their family but sir john did not 
sport long with the curiosity which he delighted to raise 
for he had at least as much pleasure in telling the name 
as miss steele had in hearing it 
his name is ferrars said he in a very audible whisper 
but pray do not tell it for it is a great secret 
ferrars repeated miss steele mr ferrars is 
the happy man is he what your sister in law s brother 
miss dashwood a very agreeable young man to be sure 
i know him very well 
how can you say so anne cried lucy who generally 
made an amendment to all her sister s assertions 
though we have seen him once or twice at my uncle s it 
is rather too much to pretend to know him very well 
elinor heard all this with attention and surprise 
and who was this uncle where did he live how came 
they acquainted she wished very much to have the subject 
continued though she did not chuse to join in it herself 
but nothing more of it was said and for the first time 
in her life she thought mrs jennings deficient either 
in curiosity after petty information or in a disposition 
to communicate it the manner in which miss steele had 
spoken of edward increased her curiosity for it struck 
her as being rather ill natured and suggested the suspicion 
of that lady s knowing or fancying herself to know something 
to his disadvantage but her curiosity was unavailing 
for no farther notice was taken of mr ferrars s name by 
miss steele when alluded to or even openly mentioned by sir 
john 
chapter 
marianne who had never much toleration for any 
thing like impertinence vulgarity inferiority of parts 
or even difference of taste from herself was at 
this time particularly ill disposed from the state 
of her spirits to be pleased with the miss steeles 
or to encourage their advances and to the invariable 
coldness of her behaviour towards them which checked every 
endeavour at intimacy on their side elinor principally 
attributed that preference of herself which soon became 
evident in the manners of both but especially of lucy 
who missed no opportunity of engaging her in conversation 
or of striving to improve their acquaintance by an easy 
and frank communication of her sentiments 
lucy was naturally clever her remarks were often 
just and amusing and as a companion for half an hour 
elinor frequently found her agreeable but her powers 
had received no aid from education she was ignorant 
and illiterate and her deficiency of all mental improvement 
her want of information in the most common particulars 
could not be concealed from miss dashwood in spite of her 
constant endeavour to appear to advantage elinor saw 
and pitied her for the neglect of abilities which education 
might have rendered so respectable but she saw with less 
tenderness of feeling the thorough want of delicacy 
of rectitude and integrity of mind which her attentions 
her assiduities her flatteries at the park betrayed 
and she could have no lasting satisfaction in the company 
of a person who joined insincerity with ignorance 
whose want of instruction prevented their meeting 
in conversation on terms of equality and whose conduct 
toward others made every shew of attention and deference 
towards herself perfectly valueless 
you will think my question an odd one i dare say 
said lucy to her one day as they were walking together 
from the park to the cottage but pray are you 
personally acquainted with your sister in law s mother 
mrs ferrars 
elinor did think the question a very odd one 
and her countenance expressed it as she answered that she 
had never seen mrs ferrars 
indeed replied lucy i wonder at that for i 
thought you must have seen her at norland sometimes 
then perhaps you cannot tell me what sort of a woman 
she is 
no returned elinor cautious of giving her real 
opinion of edward s mother and not very desirous 
of satisfying what seemed impertinent curiosity 
i know nothing of her 
i am sure you think me very strange for enquiring 
about her in such a way said lucy eyeing elinor attentively 
as she spoke but perhaps there may be reasons i wish 
i might venture but however i hope you will do me the justice 
of believing that i do not mean to be impertinent 
elinor made her a civil reply and they walked on 
for a few minutes in silence it was broken by lucy 
who renewed the subject again by saying with some 
hesitation 
i cannot bear to have you think me impertinently curious 
i am sure i would rather do any thing in the world than be 
thought so by a person whose good opinion is so well worth 
having as yours and i am sure i should not have the smallest 
fear of trusting you indeed i should be very glad of your 
advice how to manage in such and uncomfortable situation 
as i am but however there is no occasion to trouble you 
i am sorry you do not happen to know mrs ferrars 
i am sorry i do not said elinor in great astonishment 
if it could be of any use to you to know my opinion of her 
but really i never understood that you were at all connected 
with that family and therefore i am a little surprised 
i confess at so serious an inquiry into her character 
i dare say you are and i am sure i do not at all 
wonder at it but if i dared tell you all you would not be 
so much surprised mrs ferrars is certainly nothing to me 
at present but the time may come how soon it will come 
must depend upon herself when we may be very intimately 
connected 
she looked down as she said this amiably bashful 
with only one side glance at her companion to observe its 
effect on her 
good heavens cried elinor what do you mean 
are you acquainted with mr robert ferrars can you be 
and she did not feel much delighted with the idea of such 
a sister in law 
no replied lucy not to mr robert ferrars i 
never saw him in my life but fixing her eyes upon elinor 
to his eldest brother 
what felt elinor at that moment astonishment 
that would have been as painful as it was strong had not 
an immediate disbelief of the assertion attended it 
she turned towards lucy in silent amazement unable to divine 
the reason or object of such a declaration and though 
her complexion varied she stood firm in incredulity 
and felt in no danger of an hysterical fit or a swoon 
you may well be surprised continued lucy 
for to be sure you could have had no idea of it before 
for i dare say he never dropped the smallest hint of it 
to you or any of your family because it was always meant 
to be a great secret and i am sure has been faithfully 
kept so by me to this hour not a soul of all my relations 
know of it but anne and i never should have mentioned 
it to you if i had not felt the greatest dependence 
in the world upon your secrecy and i really thought my 
behaviour in asking so many questions about mrs ferrars 
must seem so odd that it ought to be explained 
and i do not think mr ferrars can be displeased 
when he knows i have trusted you because i know he has 
the highest opinion in the world of all your family 
and looks upon yourself and the other miss dashwoods quite 
as his own sisters she paused 
elinor for a few moments remained silent 
her astonishment at what she heard was at first too 
great for words but at length forcing herself to speak 
and to speak cautiously she said with calmness of manner 
which tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude 
may i ask if your engagement is of long standing 
we have been engaged these four years 
four years 
yes 
elinor though greatly shocked still felt unable 
to believe it 
i did not know said she that you were even 
acquainted till the other day 
our acquaintance however is of many years date 
he was under my uncle s care you know a considerable while 
your uncle 
yes mr pratt did you never hear him talk 
of mr pratt 
i think i have replied elinor with an exertion 
of spirits which increased with her increase of emotion 
he was four years with my uncle who lives at longstaple 
near plymouth it was there our acquaintance begun 
for my sister and me was often staying with my uncle 
and it was there our engagement was formed though not till 
a year after he had quitted as a pupil but he was almost 
always with us afterwards i was very unwilling to enter 
into it as you may imagine without the knowledge and 
approbation of his mother but i was too young and loved 
him too well to be so prudent as i ought to have been 
though you do not know him so well as me miss dashwood 
you must have seen enough of him to be sensible he is 
very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him 
certainly answered elinor without knowing what 
she said but after a moment s reflection she added 
with revived security of edward s honour and love 
and her companion s falsehood engaged to mr edward 
ferrars i confess myself so totally surprised at 
what you tell me that really i beg your pardon 
but surely there must be some mistake of person or name 
we cannot mean the same mr ferrars 
we can mean no other cried lucy smiling mr edward 
ferrars the eldest son of mrs ferrars of park street 
and brother of your sister in law mrs john dashwood 
is the person i mean you must allow that i am not likely 
to be deceived as to the name of the man on who all my happiness 
depends 
it is strange replied elinor in a most painful perplexity 
that i should never have heard him even mention your name 
no considering our situation it was not strange 
our first care has been to keep the matter secret 
you knew nothing of me or my family and therefore 
there could be no occasion for ever mentioning my name 
to you and as he was always particularly afraid of his 
sister s suspecting any thing that was reason enough 
for his not mentioning it 
she was silent elinor s security sunk but her 
self command did not sink with it 
four years you have been engaged said she 
with a firm voice 
yes and heaven knows how much longer we may have 
to wait poor edward it puts him quite out of heart 
then taking a small miniature from her pocket she added 
to prevent the possibility of mistake be so good as to look 
at this face it does not do him justice to be sure 
but yet i think you cannot be deceived as to the person 
it was drew for i have had it above these three years 
she put it into her hands as she spoke and when elinor 
saw the painting whatever other doubts her fear of a 
too hasty decision or her wish of detecting falsehood 
might suffer to linger in her mind she could have none of 
its being edward s face she returned it almost instantly 
acknowledging the likeness 
i have never been able continued lucy to give 
him my picture in return which i am very much vexed at 
for he has been always so anxious to get it but i am 
determined to set for it the very first opportunity 
you are quite in the right replied elinor calmly 
they then proceeded a few paces in silence lucy spoke first 
i am sure said she i have no doubt in the world 
of your faithfully keeping this secret because you must 
know of what importance it is to us not to have it reach 
his mother for she would never approve of it i dare say 
i shall have no fortune and i fancy she is an exceeding 
proud woman 
i certainly did not seek your confidence said elinor 
but you do me no more than justice in imagining that i 
may be depended on your secret is safe with me 
but pardon me if i express some surprise at so unnecessary 
a communication you must at least have felt that my 
being acquainted with it could not add to its safety 
as she said this she looked earnestly at lucy 
hoping to discover something in her countenance perhaps the 
falsehood of the greatest part of what she had been saying 
but lucy s countenance suffered no change 
i was afraid you would think i was taking a great 
liberty with you said she in telling you all this 
i have not known you long to be sure personally at least 
but i have known you and all your family by description 
a great while and as soon as i saw you i felt almost as if 
you was an old acquaintance besides in the present case 
i really thought some explanation was due to you after my 
making such particular inquiries about edward s mother 
and i am so unfortunate that i have not a creature whose 
advice i can ask anne is the only person that knows of it 
and she has no judgment at all indeed she does me a great 
deal more harm than good for i am in constant fear of her 
betraying me she does not know how to hold her tongue 
as you must perceive and i am sure i was in the greatest 
fright in the world t other day when edward s name was 
mentioned by sir john lest she should out with it all 
you cannot think how much i go through in my mind from 
it altogether i only wonder that i am alive after what 
i have suffered for edward s sake these last four years 
every thing in such suspense and uncertainty and seeing 
him so seldom we can hardly meet above twice a year 
i am sure i wonder my heart is not quite broke 
here she took out her handkerchief but elinor did 
not feel very compassionate 
sometimes continued lucy after wiping her eyes 
i think whether it would not be better for us both 
to break off the matter entirely as she said this 
she looked directly at her companion but then 
at other times i have not resolution enough for it 
i cannot bear the thoughts of making him so miserable 
as i know the very mention of such a thing would do 
and on my own account too so dear as he is to me i do not 
think i could be equal to it what would you advise 
me to do in such a case miss dashwood what would you 
do yourself 
pardon me replied elinor startled by the question 
but i can give you no advice under such circumstances 
your own judgment must direct you 
to be sure continued lucy after a few minutes 
silence on both sides his mother must provide for him 
sometime or other but poor edward is so cast down by it 
did you not think him dreadful low spirited when he was at 
barton he was so miserable when he left us at longstaple 
to go to you that i was afraid you would think him quite ill 
did he come from your uncle s then when he visited us 
oh yes he had been staying a fortnight with us 
did you think he came directly from town 
no replied elinor most feelingly sensible of 
every fresh circumstance in favour of lucy s veracity 
i remember he told us that he had been staying 
a fortnight with some friends near plymouth 
she remembered too her own surprise at the time 
at his mentioning nothing farther of those friends 
at his total silence with respect even to their names 
did not you think him sadly out of spirits 
repeated lucy 
we did indeed particularly so when he first arrived 
i begged him to exert himself for fear you 
should suspect what was the matter but it made him 
so melancholy not being able to stay more than a 
fortnight with us and seeing me so much affected 
poor fellow i am afraid it is just the same with him now 
for he writes in wretched spirits i heard from him just 
before i left exeter taking a letter from her pocket 
and carelessly showing the direction to elinor 
you know his hand i dare say a charming one it is 
but that is not written so well as usual he was tired 
i dare say for he had just filled the sheet to me as full 
as possible 
elinor saw that it was his hand and she could doubt 
no longer this picture she had allowed herself to believe 
might have been accidentally obtained it might not have 
been edward s gift but a correspondence between them 
by letter could subsist only under a positive engagement 
could be authorised by nothing else for a few moments she 
was almost overcome her heart sunk within her and she could 
hardly stand but exertion was indispensably necessary 
and she struggled so resolutely against the oppression 
of her feelings that her success was speedy and for 
the time complete 
writing to each other said lucy returning the 
letter into her pocket is the only comfort we have 
in such long separations yes i have one other comfort 
in his picture but poor edward has not even that 
if he had but my picture he says he should be easy 
i gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at 
longstaple last and that was some comfort to him he said 
but not equal to a picture perhaps you might notice 
the ring when you saw him 
i did said elinor with a composure of voice 
under which was concealed an emotion and distress beyond 
any thing she had ever felt before she was mortified 
shocked confounded 
fortunately for her they had now reached the cottage 
and the conversation could be continued no farther 
after sitting with them a few minutes the miss steeles 
returned to the park and elinor was then at liberty 
to think and be wretched 
at this point in the first and second editions volume ends 
chapter 
however small elinor s general dependence on 
lucy s veracity might be it was impossible for her 
on serious reflection to suspect it in the present case 
where no temptation could be answerable to the folly 
of inventing a falsehood of such a description what lucy 
had asserted to be true therefore elinor could not 
dared not longer doubt supported as it was too on every 
side by such probabilities and proofs and contradicted 
by nothing but her own wishes their opportunity of 
acquaintance in the house of mr pratt was a foundation 
for the rest at once indisputable and alarming and edward s 
visit near plymouth his melancholy state of mind 
his dissatisfaction at his own prospects his uncertain 
behaviour towards herself the intimate knowledge of the 
miss steeles as to norland and their family connections 
which had often surprised her the picture the letter 
the ring formed altogether such a body of evidence 
as overcame every fear of condemning him unfairly 
and established as a fact which no partiality could 
set aside his ill treatment of herself her resentment 
of such behaviour her indignation at having been its dupe 
for a short time made her feel only for herself 
but other ideas other considerations soon arose 
had edward been intentionally deceiving her had he feigned 
a regard for her which he did not feel was his engagement 
to lucy an engagement of the heart no whatever it might 
once have been she could not believe it such at present 
his affection was all her own she could not be deceived 
in that her mother sisters fanny all had been 
conscious of his regard for her at norland it was not 
an illusion of her own vanity he certainly loved her 
what a softener of the heart was this persuasion how much 
could it not tempt her to forgive he had been blamable 
highly blamable in remaining at norland after he first 
felt her influence over him to be more than it ought 
to be in that he could not be defended but if he 
had injured her how much more had he injured himself 
if her case were pitiable his was hopeless 
his imprudence had made her miserable for a while but it 
seemed to have deprived himself of all chance of ever 
being otherwise she might in time regain tranquillity 
but he what had he to look forward to could he 
ever be tolerably happy with lucy steele could he 
were his affection for herself out of the question 
with his integrity his delicacy and well informed mind 
be satisfied with a wife like her illiterate artful 
and selfish 
the youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally 
blind him to every thing but her beauty and good nature 
but the four succeeding years years which if rationally 
spent give such improvement to the understanding must 
have opened his eyes to her defects of education 
while the same period of time spent on her side 
in inferior society and more frivolous pursuits 
had perhaps robbed her of that simplicity which might 
once have given an interesting character to her beauty 
if in the supposition of his seeking to marry herself 
his difficulties from his mother had seemed great 
how much greater were they now likely to be when 
the object of his engagement was undoubtedly inferior 
in connections and probably inferior in fortune to herself 
these difficulties indeed with a heart so alienated 
from lucy might not press very hard upon his patience 
but melancholy was the state of the person by whom the 
expectation of family opposition and unkindness could 
be felt as a relief 
as these considerations occurred to her in painful 
succession she wept for him more than for herself 
supported by the conviction of having done nothing to 
merit her present unhappiness and consoled by the belief 
that edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem 
she thought she could even now under the first smart 
of the heavy blow command herself enough to guard every 
suspicion of the truth from her mother and sisters 
and so well was she able to answer her own expectations 
that when she joined them at dinner only two hours 
after she had first suffered the extinction of all her 
dearest hopes no one would have supposed from the 
appearance of the sisters that elinor was mourning 
in secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever 
from the object of her love and that marianne was 
internally dwelling on the perfections of a man of whose 
whole heart she felt thoroughly possessed and whom she 
expected to see in every carriage which drove near their house 
the necessity of concealing from her mother and 
marianne what had been entrusted in confidence to herself 
though it obliged her to unceasing exertion was no 
aggravation of elinor s distress on the contrary 
it was a relief to her to be spared the communication 
of what would give such affliction to them and to be 
saved likewise from hearing that condemnation of edward 
which would probably flow from the excess of their partial 
affection for herself and which was more than she felt 
equal to support 
from their counsel or their conversation she knew 
she could receive no assistance their tenderness and 
sorrow must add to her distress while her self command 
would neither receive encouragement from their example 
nor from their praise she was stronger alone 
and her own good sense so well supported her that her 
firmness was as unshaken her appearance of cheerfulness 
as invariable as with regrets so poignant and so fresh 
it was possible for them to be 
much as she had suffered from her first conversation 
with lucy on the subject she soon felt an earnest wish 
of renewing it and this for more reasons than one 
she wanted to hear many particulars of their engagement 
repeated again she wanted more clearly to understand 
what lucy really felt for edward whether there were any 
sincerity in her declaration of tender regard for him 
and she particularly wanted to convince lucy by her 
readiness to enter on the matter again and her calmness 
in conversing on it that she was no otherwise interested 
in it than as a friend which she very much feared 
her involuntary agitation in their morning discourse 
must have left at least doubtful that lucy was disposed 
to be jealous of her appeared very probable it was plain 
that edward had always spoken highly in her praise 
not merely from lucy s assertion but from her venturing 
to trust her on so short a personal acquaintance 
with a secret so confessedly and evidently important 
and even sir john s joking intelligence must have had 
some weight but indeed while elinor remained so well 
assured within herself of being really beloved by edward 
it required no other consideration of probabilities 
to make it natural that lucy should be jealous 
and that she was so her very confidence was a proof 
what other reason for the disclosure of the affair could 
there be but that elinor might be informed by it of lucy s 
superior claims on edward and be taught to avoid him 
in future she had little difficulty in understanding thus 
much of her rival s intentions and while she was firmly 
resolved to act by her as every principle of honour and 
honesty directed to combat her own affection for edward 
and to see him as little as possible she could not deny 
herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince lucy 
that her heart was unwounded and as she could now have 
nothing more painful to hear on the subject than had already 
been told she did not mistrust her own ability of going 
through a repetition of particulars with composure 
but it was not immediately that an opportunity 
of doing so could be commanded though lucy was as well 
disposed as herself to take advantage of any that occurred 
for the weather was not often fine enough to allow 
of their joining in a walk where they might most easily 
separate themselves from the others and though they 
met at least every other evening either at the park 
or cottage and chiefly at the former they could 
not be supposed to meet for the sake of conversation 
such a thought would never enter either sir john or lady 
middleton s head and therefore very little leisure 
was ever given for a general chat and none at all for 
particular discourse they met for the sake of eating 
drinking and laughing together playing at cards 
or consequences or any other game that was sufficiently noisy 
one or two meetings of this kind had taken place 
without affording elinor any chance of engaging lucy 
in private when sir john called at the cottage one morning 
to beg in the name of charity that they would all 
dine with lady middleton that day as he was obliged 
to attend the club at exeter and she would otherwise be 
quite alone except her mother and the two miss steeles 
elinor who foresaw a fairer opening for the point she 
had in view in such a party as this was likely to be 
more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil 
and well bred direction of lady middleton than when 
her husband united them together in one noisy purpose 
immediately accepted the invitation margaret with her 
mother s permission was equally compliant and marianne 
though always unwilling to join any of their parties 
was persuaded by her mother who could not bear to have her 
seclude herself from any chance of amusement to go likewise 
the young ladies went and lady middleton was happily 
preserved from the frightful solitude which had threatened her 
the insipidity of the meeting was exactly such as elinor 
had expected it produced not one novelty of thought 
or expression and nothing could be less interesting 
than the whole of their discourse both in the dining 
parlour and drawing room to the latter the children 
accompanied them and while they remained there she was 
too well convinced of the impossibility of engaging lucy s 
attention to attempt it they quitted it only with the 
removal of the tea things the card table was then placed 
and elinor began to wonder at herself for having ever 
entertained a hope of finding time for conversation 
at the park they all rose up in preparation for a round game 
i am glad said lady middleton to lucy 
you are not going to finish poor little annamaria s 
basket this evening for i am sure it must hurt your 
eyes to work filigree by candlelight and we will make 
the dear little love some amends for her disappointment 
to morrow and then i hope she will not much mind it 
this hint was enough lucy recollected herself instantly 
and replied indeed you are very much mistaken 
lady middleton i am only waiting to know whether you can 
make your party without me or i should have been at my 
filigree already i would not disappoint the little angel 
for all the world and if you want me at the card table now 
i am resolved to finish the basket after supper 
you are very good i hope it will not hurt your eyes 
will you ring the bell for some working candles 
my poor little girl would be sadly disappointed i know 
if the basket was not finished tomorrow for though i 
told her it certainly would not i am sure she depends 
upon having it done 
lucy directly drew her work table near her 
and reseated herself with an alacrity and cheerfulness 
which seemed to infer that she could taste no greater 
delight than in making a filigree basket for a spoilt child 
lady middleton proposed a rubber of casino to the others 
no one made any objection but marianne who with her usual 
inattention to the forms of general civility exclaimed 
your ladyship will have the goodness to excuse me you 
know i detest cards i shall go to the piano forte 
i have not touched it since it was tuned and without 
farther ceremony she turned away and walked to the instrument 
lady middleton looked as if she thanked heaven 
that she had never made so rude a speech 
marianne can never keep long from that instrument 
you know madam said elinor endeavouring to smooth 
away the offence and i do not much wonder at it for it 
is the very best toned piano forte i ever heard 
the remaining five were now to draw their cards 
perhaps continued elinor if i should happen 
to cut out i may be of some use to miss lucy steele 
in rolling her papers for her and there is so much still 
to be done to the basket that it must be impossible 
i think for her labour singly to finish it this evening 
i should like the work exceedingly if she would allow 
me a share in it 
indeed i shall be very much obliged to you 
for your help cried lucy for i find there is more 
to be done to it than i thought there was and it would 
be a shocking thing to disappoint dear annamaria after all 
oh that would be terrible indeed said miss steele 
dear little soul how i do love her 
you are very kind said lady middleton to elinor 
and as you really like the work perhaps you will be 
as well pleased not to cut in till another rubber 
or will you take your chance now 
elinor joyfully profited by the first of these proposals 
and thus by a little of that address which marianne 
could never condescend to practise gained her own end 
and pleased lady middleton at the same time lucy made room 
for her with ready attention and the two fair rivals were 
thus seated side by side at the same table and with the 
utmost harmony engaged in forwarding the same work 
the pianoforte at which marianne wrapped up in her own 
music and her own thoughts had by this time forgotten 
that any body was in the room besides herself was luckily 
so near them that miss dashwood now judged she might safely 
under the shelter of its noise introduce the interesting 
subject without any risk of being heard at the card table 
chapter 
in a firm though cautious tone elinor thus began 
i should be undeserving of the confidence you have 
honoured me with if i felt no desire for its continuance 
or no farther curiosity on its subject i will 
not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again 
thank you cried lucy warmly for breaking 
the ice you have set my heart at ease by it for i was 
somehow or other afraid i had offended you by what i 
told you that monday 
offended me how could you suppose so believe me 
and elinor spoke it with the truest sincerity 
nothing could be farther from my intention than to give 
you such an idea could you have a motive for the trust 
that was not honourable and flattering to me 
and yet i do assure you replied lucy her little 
sharp eyes full of meaning there seemed to me to be 
a coldness and displeasure in your manner that made me 
quite uncomfortable i felt sure that you was angry with me 
and have been quarrelling with myself ever since for having 
took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs 
but i am very glad to find it was only my own fancy 
and that you really do not blame me if you knew what a 
consolation it was to me to relieve my heart speaking to you 
of what i am always thinking of every moment of my life 
your compassion would make you overlook every thing else 
i am sure 
indeed i can easily believe that it was a very great 
relief to you to acknowledge your situation to me and be 
assured that you shall never have reason to repent it 
your case is a very unfortunate one you seem to me to 
be surrounded with difficulties and you will have need 
of all your mutual affection to support you under them 
mr ferrars i believe is entirely dependent on his mother 
he has only two thousand pounds of his own it would 
be madness to marry upon that though for my own part 
i could give up every prospect of more without a sigh 
i have been always used to a very small income and could 
struggle with any poverty for him but i love him too well 
to be the selfish means of robbing him perhaps of all that 
his mother might give him if he married to please her 
we must wait it may be for many years with almost every 
other man in the world it would be an alarming prospect 
but edward s affection and constancy nothing can deprive me of 
i know 
that conviction must be every thing to you 
and he is undoubtedly supported by the same trust in your s 
if the strength of your reciprocal attachment had failed 
as between many people and under many circumstances 
it naturally would during a four years engagement 
your situation would have been pitiable indeed 
lucy here looked up but elinor was careful 
in guarding her countenance from every expression 
that could give her words a suspicious tendency 
edward s love for me said lucy has been pretty 
well put to the test by our long very long absence 
since we were first engaged and it has stood the trial 
so well that i should be unpardonable to doubt it now 
i can safely say that he has never gave me one moment s 
alarm on that account from the first 
elinor hardly knew whether to smile or sigh 
at this assertion 
lucy went on i am rather of a jealous temper too 
by nature and from our different situations in life 
from his being so much more in the world than me and our 
continual separation i was enough inclined for suspicion 
to have found out the truth in an instant if there had been 
the slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met 
or any lowness of spirits that i could not account for 
or if he had talked more of one lady than another 
or seemed in any respect less happy at longstaple than he 
used to be i do not mean to say that i am particularly 
observant or quick sighted in general but in such a case 
i am sure i could not be deceived 
all this thought elinor is very pretty 
but it can impose upon neither of us 
but what said she after a short silence 
are your views or have you none but that of waiting for 
mrs ferrars s death which is a melancholy and shocking 
extremity is her son determined to submit to this 
and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense 
in which it may involve you rather than run the risk 
of her displeasure for a while by owning the truth 
if we could be certain that it would be only 
for a while but mrs ferrars is a very headstrong 
proud woman and in her first fit of anger upon hearing 
it would very likely secure every thing to robert 
and the idea of that for edward s sake frightens away 
all my inclination for hasty measures 
and for your own sake too or you are carrying 
your disinterestedness beyond reason 
lucy looked at elinor again and was silent 
do you know mr robert ferrars asked elinor 
not at all i never saw him but i fancy he 
is very unlike his brother silly and a great coxcomb 
a great coxcomb repeated miss steele whose ear had 
caught those words by a sudden pause in marianne s music 
oh they are talking of their favourite beaux i dare say 
no sister cried lucy you are mistaken there our 
favourite beaux are not great coxcombs 
i can answer for it that miss dashwood s is not 
said mrs jennings laughing heartily for he is one 
of the modestest prettiest behaved young men i ever saw 
but as for lucy she is such a sly little creature 
there is no finding out who she likes 
oh cried miss steele looking significantly round 
at them i dare say lucy s beau is quite as modest 
and pretty behaved as miss dashwood s 
elinor blushed in spite of herself lucy bit her lip 
and looked angrily at her sister a mutual silence took 
place for some time lucy first put an end to it by saying 
in a lower tone though marianne was then giving them 
the powerful protection of a very magnificent concerto 
i will honestly tell you of one scheme which has 
lately come into my head for bringing matters to bear 
indeed i am bound to let you into the secret for you 
are a party concerned i dare say you have seen enough 
of edward to know that he would prefer the church to every 
other profession now my plan is that he should take 
orders as soon as he can and then through your interest 
which i am sure you would be kind enough to use out of 
friendship for him and i hope out of some regard to me 
your brother might be persuaded to give him norland living 
which i understand is a very good one and the present 
incumbent not likely to live a great while that would 
be enough for us to marry upon and we might trust to time 
and chance for the rest 
i should always be happy replied elinor to show 
any mark of my esteem and friendship for mr ferrars 
but do you not perceive that my interest on such an 
occasion would be perfectly unnecessary he is brother 
to mrs john dashwood that must be recommendation enough 
to her husband 
but mrs john dashwood would not much approve 
of edward s going into orders 
then i rather suspect that my interest would 
do very little 
they were again silent for many minutes at length 
lucy exclaimed with a deep sigh 
i believe it would be the wisest way to put an end 
to the business at once by dissolving the engagement 
we seem so beset with difficulties on every side 
that though it would make us miserable for a time 
we should be happier perhaps in the end but you will 
not give me your advice miss dashwood 
no answered elinor with a smile which concealed 
very agitated feelings on such a subject i certainly 
will not you know very well that my opinion would have 
no weight with you unless it were on the side of your wishes 
indeed you wrong me replied lucy with great 
solemnity i know nobody of whose judgment i think 
so highly as i do of yours and i do really believe 
that if you was to say to me i advise you by all means 
to put an end to your engagement with edward ferrars 
it will be more for the happiness of both of you 
i should resolve upon doing it immediately 
elinor blushed for the insincerity of edward s 
future wife and replied this compliment would effectually 
frighten me from giving any opinion on the subject 
had i formed one it raises my influence much too high 
the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached 
is too much for an indifferent person 
it is because you are an indifferent person said lucy 
with some pique and laying a particular stress on those words 
that your judgment might justly have such weight with me 
if you could be supposed to be biased in any respect 
by your own feelings your opinion would not be worth having 
elinor thought it wisest to make no answer to this 
lest they might provoke each other to an unsuitable increase 
of ease and unreserve and was even partly determined 
never to mention the subject again another pause 
therefore of many minutes duration succeeded this speech 
and lucy was still the first to end it 
shall you be in town this winter miss dashwood 
said she with all her accustomary complacency 
certainly not 
i am sorry for that returned the other 
while her eyes brightened at the information 
it would have gave me such pleasure to meet you there 
but i dare say you will go for all that to be sure 
your brother and sister will ask you to come to them 
it will not be in my power to accept their invitation 
if they do 
how unlucky that is i had quite depended upon 
meeting you there anne and me are to go the latter end 
of january to some relations who have been wanting us to 
visit them these several years but i only go for the sake 
of seeing edward he will be there in february otherwise 
london would have no charms for me i have not spirits for it 
elinor was soon called to the card table by the 
conclusion of the first rubber and the confidential 
discourse of the two ladies was therefore at an end 
to which both of them submitted without any reluctance 
for nothing had been said on either side to make them 
dislike each other less than they had done before 
and elinor sat down to the card table with the melancholy 
persuasion that edward was not only without affection 
for the person who was to be his wife but that he had 
not even the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage 
which sincere affection on her side would have given 
for self interest alone could induce a woman to keep a man 
to an engagement of which she seemed so thoroughly aware 
that he was weary 
from this time the subject was never revived by elinor 
and when entered on by lucy who seldom missed an opportunity 
of introducing it and was particularly careful to inform 
her confidante of her happiness whenever she received a letter 
from edward it was treated by the former with calmness 
and caution and dismissed as soon as civility would allow 
for she felt such conversations to be an indulgence which 
lucy did not deserve and which were dangerous to herself 
the visit of the miss steeles at barton park was 
lengthened far beyond what the first invitation implied 
their favour increased they could not be spared 
sir john would not hear of their going and in spite 
of their numerous and long arranged engagements in exeter 
in spite of the absolute necessity of returning to fulfill 
them immediately which was in full force at the end 
of every week they were prevailed on to stay nearly two 
months at the park and to assist in the due celebration 
of that festival which requires a more than ordinary 
share of private balls and large dinners to proclaim 
its importance 
chapter 
though mrs jennings was in the habit of spending a large 
portion of the year at the houses of her children and friends 
she was not without a settled habitation of her own 
since the death of her husband who had traded with success 
in a less elegant part of the town she had resided every 
winter in a house in one of the streets near portman square 
towards this home she began on the approach of january 
to turn her thoughts and thither she one day abruptly 
and very unexpectedly by them asked the elder misses 
dashwood to accompany her elinor without observing 
the varying complexion of her sister and the animated look 
which spoke no indifference to the plan immediately gave 
a grateful but absolute denial for both in which she 
believed herself to be speaking their united inclinations 
the reason alleged was their determined resolution 
of not leaving their mother at that time of the year 
mrs jennings received the refusal with some surprise 
and repeated her invitation immediately 
oh lord i am sure your mother can spare you 
very well and i do beg you will favour me with 
your company for i have quite set my heart upon it 
do not fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me 
for i shall not put myself at all out of my way for you 
it will only be sending betty by the coach and i 
hope i can afford that we three shall be able to go 
very well in my chaise and when we are in town 
if you do not like to go wherever i do well and good 
you may always go with one of my daughters i am sure 
your mother will not object to it for i have had such 
good luck in getting my own children off my hands that she 
will think me a very fit person to have the charge of you 
and if i do not get one of you at least well married 
before i have done with you it shall not be my fault 
i shall speak a good word for you to all the young men 
you may depend upon it 
i have a notion said sir john that miss marianne 
would not object to such a scheme if her elder sister 
would come into it it is very hard indeed that she 
should not have a little pleasure because miss dashwood 
does not wish it so i would advise you two to set off 
for town when you are tired of barton without saying 
a word to miss dashwood about it 
nay cried mrs jennings i am sure i shall be 
monstrous glad of miss marianne s company whether miss 
dashwood will go or not only the more the merrier say i 
and i thought it would be more comfortable for them to 
be together because if they got tired of me they might talk 
to one another and laugh at my old ways behind my back 
but one or the other if not both of them i must have 
lord bless me how do you think i can live poking by myself 
i who have been always used till this winter to have 
charlotte with me come miss marianne let us strike 
hands upon the bargain and if miss dashwood will change 
her mind by and bye why so much the better 
i thank you madam sincerely thank you said marianne 
with warmth your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever 
and it would give me such happiness yes almost the greatest 
happiness i am capable of to be able to accept it 
but my mother my dearest kindest mother i feel the 
justice of what elinor has urged and if she were to be 
made less happy less comfortable by our absence oh no 
nothing should tempt me to leave her it should not 
must not be a struggle 
mrs jennings repeated her assurance that mrs dashwood 
could spare them perfectly well and elinor who now 
understood her sister and saw to what indifference to 
almost every thing else she was carried by her eagerness 
to be with willoughby again made no farther direct 
opposition to the plan and merely referred it to her 
mother s decision from whom however she scarcely expected 
to receive any support in her endeavour to prevent a visit 
which she could not approve of for marianne and which 
on her own account she had particular reasons to avoid 
whatever marianne was desirous of her mother would be eager 
to promote she could not expect to influence the latter 
to cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she 
had never been able to inspire her with distrust and she 
dared not explain the motive of her own disinclination 
for going to london that marianne fastidious as she was 
thoroughly acquainted with mrs jennings manners 
and invariably disgusted by them should overlook every 
inconvenience of that kind should disregard whatever 
must be most wounding to her irritable feelings in her 
pursuit of one object was such a proof so strong 
so full of the importance of that object to her as elinor 
in spite of all that had passed was not prepared to witness 
on being informed of the invitation mrs dashwood 
persuaded that such an excursion would be productive 
of much amusement to both her daughters and perceiving 
through all her affectionate attention to herself 
how much the heart of marianne was in it would not hear 
of their declining the offer upon her account insisted on 
their both accepting it directly and then began to foresee 
with her usual cheerfulness a variety of advantages that 
would accrue to them all from this separation 
i am delighted with the plan she cried 
it is exactly what i could wish margaret and i shall 
be as much benefited by it as yourselves when you 
and the middletons are gone we shall go on so quietly 
and happily together with our books and our music you 
will find margaret so improved when you come back again 
i have a little plan of alteration for your bedrooms too 
which may now be performed without any inconvenience 
to any one it is very right that you should go to town 
i would have every young woman of your condition in life 
acquainted with the manners and amusements of london 
you will be under the care of a motherly good sort 
of woman of whose kindness to you i can have no doubt 
and in all probability you will see your brother 
and whatever may be his faults or the faults of his wife 
when i consider whose son he is i cannot bear to have you so 
wholly estranged from each other 
though with your usual anxiety for our happiness 
said elinor you have been obviating every impediment 
to the present scheme which occurred to you there is 
still one objection which in my opinion cannot be so 
easily removed 
marianne s countenance sunk 
and what said mrs dashwood is my dear prudent 
elinor going to suggest what formidable obstacle is she 
now to bring forward do let me hear a word about the 
expense of it 
my objection is this though i think very well of 
mrs jennings s heart she is not a woman whose society 
can afford us pleasure or whose protection will give 
us consequence 
that is very true replied her mother but of 
her society separately from that of other people 
you will scarcely have any thing at all and you will 
almost always appear in public with lady middleton 
if elinor is frightened away by her dislike of 
mrs jennings said marianne at least it need not prevent 
my accepting her invitation i have no such scruples 
and i am sure i could put up with every unpleasantness 
of that kind with very little effort 
elinor could not help smiling at this display of 
indifference towards the manners of a person to whom she 
had often had difficulty in persuading marianne to behave 
with tolerable politeness and resolved within herself 
that if her sister persisted in going she would 
go likewise as she did not think it proper that marianne 
should be left to the sole guidance of her own judgment 
or that mrs jennings should be abandoned to the mercy 
of marianne for all the comfort of her domestic hours 
to this determination she was the more easily reconciled 
by recollecting that edward ferrars by lucy s account 
was not to be in town before february and that 
their visit without any unreasonable abridgement 
might be previously finished 
i will have you both go said mrs dashwood 
these objections are nonsensical you will have much 
pleasure in being in london and especially in being together 
and if elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment 
she would foresee it there from a variety of sources 
she would perhaps expect some from improving her 
acquaintance with her sister in law s family 
elinor had often wished for an opportunity of 
attempting to weaken her mother s dependence on the 
attachment of edward and herself that the shock might 
be less when the whole truth were revealed and now 
on this attack though almost hopeless of success 
she forced herself to begin her design by saying 
as calmly as she could i like edward ferrars very much 
and shall always be glad to see him but as to the rest 
of the family it is a matter of perfect indifference 
to me whether i am ever known to them or not 
mrs dashwood smiled and said nothing 
marianne lifted up her eyes in astonishment and elinor 
conjectured that she might as well have held her tongue 
after very little farther discourse it was finally 
settled that the invitation should be fully accepted 
mrs jennings received the information with a great 
deal of joy and many assurances of kindness and care 
nor was it a matter of pleasure merely to her sir john 
was delighted for to a man whose prevailing anxiety 
was the dread of being alone the acquisition of two 
to the number of inhabitants in london was something 
even lady middleton took the trouble of being delighted 
which was putting herself rather out of her way 
and as for the miss steeles especially lucy they had 
never been so happy in their lives as this intelligence 
made them 
elinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted 
her wishes with less reluctance than she had expected 
to feel with regard to herself it was now a matter 
of unconcern whether she went to town or not and when 
she saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan 
and her sister exhilarated by it in look voice and manner 
restored to all her usual animation and elevated to more 
than her usual gaiety she could not be dissatisfied 
with the because and would hardly allow herself to distrust 
the consequence 
marianne s joy was almost a degree beyond happiness 
so great was the perturbation of her spirits and her 
impatience to be gone her unwillingness to quit her 
mother was her only restorative to calmness and at the 
moment of parting her grief on that score was excessive 
her mother s affliction was hardly less and elinor 
was the only one of the three who seemed to consider 
the separation as any thing short of eternal 
their departure took place in the first week in january 
the middletons were to follow in about a week the miss 
steeles kept their station at the park and were to quit 
it only with the rest of the family 
chapter 
elinor could not find herself in the carriage with mrs jennings 
and beginning a journey to london under her protection 
and as her guest without wondering at her own situation 
so short had their acquaintance with that lady been 
so wholly unsuited were they in age and disposition 
and so many had been her objections against such a measure 
only a few days before but these objections had all 
with that happy ardour of youth which marianne and her mother 
equally shared been overcome or overlooked and elinor 
in spite of every occasional doubt of willoughby s constancy 
could not witness the rapture of delightful expectation 
which filled the whole soul and beamed in the eyes 
of marianne without feeling how blank was her own prospect 
how cheerless her own state of mind in the comparison 
and how gladly she would engage in the solicitude of 
marianne s situation to have the same animating object 
in view the same possibility of hope a short a very 
short time however must now decide what willoughby s 
intentions were in all probability he was already in town 
marianne s eagerness to be gone declared her dependence 
on finding him there and elinor was resolved not only upon 
gaining every new light as to his character which her 
own observation or the intelligence of others could give her 
but likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister 
with such zealous attention as to ascertain what he was 
and what he meant before many meetings had taken place 
should the result of her observations be unfavourable 
she was determined at all events to open the eyes 
of her sister should it be otherwise her exertions 
would be of a different nature she must then learn 
to avoid every selfish comparison and banish every regret 
which might lessen her satisfaction in the happiness of marianne 
they were three days on their journey and marianne s 
behaviour as they travelled was a happy specimen of what 
future complaisance and companionableness to mrs jennings 
might be expected to be she sat in silence almost all 
the way wrapt in her own meditations and scarcely ever 
voluntarily speaking except when any object of picturesque 
beauty within their view drew from her an exclamation 
of delight exclusively addressed to her sister to atone 
for this conduct therefore elinor took immediate possession 
of the post of civility which she had assigned herself 
behaved with the greatest attention to mrs jennings 
talked with her laughed with her and listened to her 
whenever she could and mrs jennings on her side 
treated them both with all possible kindness was solicitous 
on every occasion for their ease and enjoyment and only 
disturbed that she could not make them choose their own 
dinners at the inn nor extort a confession of their 
preferring salmon to cod or boiled fowls to veal cutlets 
they reached town by three of the clock the third day glad to 
be released after such a journey from the confinement 
of a carriage and ready to enjoy all the luxury of a good fire 
the house was handsome and handsomely fitted up 
and the young ladies were immediately put in possession 
of a very comfortable apartment it had formerly 
been charlotte s and over the mantelpiece still hung 
a landscape in coloured silks of her performance 
in proof of her having spent seven years at a great school 
in town to some effect 
as dinner was not to be ready in less than two 
hours from their arrival elinor determined to employ 
the interval in writing to her mother and sat down for 
that purpose in a few moments marianne did the same 
i am writing home marianne said elinor had not you 
better defer your letter for a day or two 
i am not going to write to my mother 
replied marianne hastily and as if wishing to avoid 
any farther inquiry elinor said no more it immediately 
struck her that she must then be writing to willoughby 
and the conclusion which as instantly followed was 
that however mysteriously they might wish to conduct 
the affair they must be engaged this conviction 
though not entirely satisfactory gave her pleasure 
and she continued her letter with greater alacrity 
marianne s was finished in a very few minutes 
in length it could be no more than a note it was then 
folded up sealed and directed with eager rapidity 
elinor thought she could distinguish a large w in 
the direction and no sooner was it complete than marianne 
ringing the bell requested the footman who answered it 
to get that letter conveyed for her to the two penny post 
this decided the matter at once 
her spirits still continued very high but there 
was a flutter in them which prevented their giving much 
pleasure to her sister and this agitation increased as 
the evening drew on she could scarcely eat any dinner 
and when they afterwards returned to the drawing room 
seemed anxiously listening to the sound of every carriage 
it was a great satisfaction to elinor that mrs jennings 
by being much engaged in her own room could see little 
of what was passing the tea things were brought in 
and already had marianne been disappointed more than once 
by a rap at a neighbouring door when a loud one was suddenly 
heard which could not be mistaken for one at any other house 
elinor felt secure of its announcing willoughby s approach 
and marianne starting up moved towards the door 
every thing was silent this could not be borne many seconds 
she opened the door advanced a few steps towards the stairs 
and after listening half a minute returned into the room 
in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard 
him would naturally produce in the ecstasy of her 
feelings at that instant she could not help exclaiming 
oh elinor it is willoughby indeed it is and seemed 
almost ready to throw herself into his arms when colonel 
brandon appeared 
it was too great a shock to be borne with calmness 
and she immediately left the room elinor was disappointed too 
but at the same time her regard for colonel brandon ensured 
his welcome with her and she felt particularly hurt that 
a man so partial to her sister should perceive that she 
experienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing him 
she instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him 
that he even observed marianne as she quitted the room 
with such astonishment and concern as hardly left him 
the recollection of what civility demanded towards herself 
is your sister ill said he 
elinor answered in some distress that she was 
and then talked of head aches low spirits and over fatigues 
and of every thing to which she could decently attribute 
her sister s behaviour 
he heard her with the most earnest attention 
but seeming to recollect himself said no more on the subject 
and began directly to speak of his pleasure at seeing them 
in london making the usual inquiries about their journey 
and the friends they had left behind 
in this calm kind of way with very little interest 
on either side they continued to talk both of them out 
of spirits and the thoughts of both engaged elsewhere 
elinor wished very much to ask whether willoughby were 
then in town but she was afraid of giving him pain 
by any enquiry after his rival and at length by way 
of saying something she asked if he had been in london 
ever since she had seen him last yes he replied 
with some embarrassment almost ever since i have been 
once or twice at delaford for a few days but it has never 
been in my power to return to barton 
this and the manner in which it was said 
immediately brought back to her remembrance all the 
circumstances of his quitting that place with the 
uneasiness and suspicions they had caused to mrs jennings 
and she was fearful that her question had implied 
much more curiosity on the subject than she had ever felt 
mrs jennings soon came in oh colonel said she 
with her usual noisy cheerfulness i am monstrous glad 
to see you sorry i could not come before beg your 
pardon but i have been forced to look about me a little 
and settle my matters for it is a long while since i 
have been at home and you know one has always a world 
of little odd things to do after one has been away for 
any time and then i have had cartwright to settle with 
lord i have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner 
but pray colonel how came you to conjure out that i should 
be in town today 
i had the pleasure of hearing it at mr palmer s 
where i have been dining 
oh you did well and how do they all do at their 
house how does charlotte do i warrant you she is a fine 
size by this time 
mrs palmer appeared quite well and i am commissioned 
to tell you that you will certainly see her to morrow 
ay to be sure i thought as much well colonel 
i have brought two young ladies with me you see that is 
you see but one of them now but there is another somewhere 
your friend miss marianne too which you will not be 
sorry to hear i do not know what you and mr willoughby 
will do between you about her ay it is a fine thing 
to be young and handsome well i was young once but i 
never was very handsome worse luck for me however i got 
a very good husband and i do not know what the greatest 
beauty can do more ah poor man he has been dead 
these eight years and better but colonel where have 
you been to since we parted and how does your business 
go on come come let us have no secrets among friends 
he replied with his accustomary mildness to all 
her inquiries but without satisfying her in any 
elinor now began to make the tea and marianne was 
obliged to appear again 
after her entrance colonel brandon became 
more thoughtful and silent than he had been before 
and mrs jennings could not prevail on him to stay long 
no other visitor appeared that evening and the ladies 
were unanimous in agreeing to go early to bed 
marianne rose the next morning with recovered spirits 
and happy looks the disappointment of the evening before 
seemed forgotten in the expectation of what was to happen 
that day they had not long finished their breakfast before 
mrs palmer s barouche stopped at the door and in a few 
minutes she came laughing into the room so delighted 
to see them all that it was hard to say whether she 
received most pleasure from meeting her mother or the miss 
dashwoods again so surprised at their coming to town 
though it was what she had rather expected all along 
so angry at their accepting her mother s invitation 
after having declined her own though at the same time 
she would never have forgiven them if they had not come 
mr palmer will be so happy to see you 
said she what do you think he said when he heard 
of your coming with mamma i forget what it was now 
but it was something so droll 
after an hour or two spent in what her mother called 
comfortable chat or in other words in every variety of inquiry 
concerning all their acquaintance on mrs jennings s side 
and in laughter without because on mrs palmer s it was 
proposed by the latter that they should all accompany 
her to some shops where she had business that morning 
to which mrs jennings and elinor readily consented 
as having likewise some purchases to make themselves 
and marianne though declining it at first was induced 
to go likewise 
wherever they went she was evidently always on 
the watch in bond street especially where much of 
their business lay her eyes were in constant inquiry 
and in whatever shop the party were engaged her mind was 
equally abstracted from every thing actually before them 
from all that interested and occupied the others 
restless and dissatisfied every where her sister could 
never obtain her opinion of any article of purchase 
however it might equally concern them both she received 
no pleasure from anything was only impatient to be at 
home again and could with difficulty govern her vexation 
at the tediousness of mrs palmer whose eye was caught 
by every thing pretty expensive or new who was wild 
to buy all could determine on none and dawdled away her 
time in rapture and indecision 
it was late in the morning before they returned home 
and no sooner had they entered the house than marianne flew 
eagerly up stairs and when elinor followed she found 
her turning from the table with a sorrowful countenance 
which declared that no willoughby had been there 
has no letter been left here for me since we went out 
said she to the footman who then entered with the parcels 
she was answered in the negative are you quite sure 
of it she replied are you certain that no servant 
no porter has left any letter or note 
the man replied that none had 
how very odd said she in a low and disappointed 
voice as she turned away to the window 
how odd indeed repeated elinor within herself 
regarding her sister with uneasiness if she had not 
known him to be in town she would not have written to him 
as she did she would have written to combe magna 
and if he is in town how odd that he should neither 
come nor write oh my dear mother you must be wrong 
in permitting an engagement between a daughter so young 
a man so little known to be carried on in so doubtful 
so mysterious a manner i long to inquire and how will my 
interference be borne 
she determined after some consideration that if 
appearances continued many days longer as unpleasant as they 
now were she would represent in the strongest manner 
to her mother the necessity of some serious enquiry into the 
affair 
mrs palmer and two elderly ladies of mrs jennings s 
intimate acquaintance whom she had met and invited 
in the morning dined with them the former left them 
soon after tea to fulfill her evening engagements 
and elinor was obliged to assist in making a whist table 
for the others marianne was of no use on these occasions 
as she would never learn the game but though her time 
was therefore at her own disposal the evening was by no 
means more productive of pleasure to her than to elinor 
for it was spent in all the anxiety of expectation and the 
pain of disappointment she sometimes endeavoured for a 
few minutes to read but the book was soon thrown aside 
and she returned to the more interesting employment 
of walking backwards and forwards across the room 
pausing for a moment whenever she came to the window 
in hopes of distinguishing the long expected rap 
chapter 
if this open weather holds much longer said mrs jennings 
when they met at breakfast the following morning 
sir john will not like leaving barton next week 
it is a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a day s pleasure 
poor souls i always pity them when they do they seem 
to take it so much to heart 
that is true cried marianne in a cheerful voice 
and walking to the window as she spoke to examine the day 
i had not thought of that this weather will keep many 
sportsmen in the country 
it was a lucky recollection all her good spirits were 
restored by it it is charming weather for them indeed 
she continued as she sat down to the breakfast table 
with a happy countenance how much they must enjoy 
it but with a little return of anxiety it cannot 
be expected to last long at this time of the year 
and after such a series of rain we shall certainly 
have very little more of it frosts will soon set in 
and in all probability with severity in another day 
or two perhaps this extreme mildness can hardly last 
longer nay perhaps it may freeze tonight 
at any rate said elinor wishing to prevent 
mrs jennings from seeing her sister s thoughts as clearly 
as she did i dare say we shall have sir john and lady 
middleton in town by the end of next week 
ay my dear i will warrant you we do mary always 
has her own way 
and now silently conjectured elinor she will 
write to combe by this day s post 
but if she did the letter was written and sent away 
with a privacy which eluded all her watchfulness to ascertain 
the fact whatever the truth of it might be and far 
as elinor was from feeling thorough contentment about it 
yet while she saw marianne in spirits she could not be 
very uncomfortable herself and marianne was in spirits 
happy in the mildness of the weather and still happier 
in her expectation of a frost 
the morning was chiefly spent in leaving cards at 
the houses of mrs jennings s acquaintance to inform 
them of her being in town and marianne was all the time 
busy in observing the direction of the wind watching the 
variations of the sky and imagining an alteration in the air 
do not you find it colder than it was in the morning 
elinor there seems to me a very decided difference 
i can hardly keep my hands warm even in my muff it was 
not so yesterday i think the clouds seem parting too 
the sun will be out in a moment and we shall have a 
clear afternoon 
elinor was alternately diverted and pained 
but marianne persevered and saw every night in the 
brightness of the fire and every morning in the appearance 
of the atmosphere the certain symptoms of approaching frost 
the miss dashwoods had no greater reason to be 
dissatisfied with mrs jennings s style of living and set 
of acquaintance than with her behaviour to themselves 
which was invariably kind every thing in her household 
arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan 
and excepting a few old city friends whom to lady 
middleton s regret she had never dropped she visited 
no one to whom an introduction could at all discompose 
the feelings of her young companions pleased to find 
herself more comfortably situated in that particular than 
she had expected elinor was very willing to compound 
for the want of much real enjoyment from any of their 
evening parties which whether at home or abroad 
formed only for cards could have little to amuse her 
colonel brandon who had a general invitation 
to the house was with them almost every day he came 
to look at marianne and talk to elinor who often derived 
more satisfaction from conversing with him than from any 
other daily occurrence but who saw at the same time 
with much concern his continued regard for her sister 
she feared it was a strengthening regard it grieved her 
to see the earnestness with which he often watched marianne 
and his spirits were certainly worse than when at barton 
about a week after their arrival it became 
certain that willoughby was also arrived his card 
was on the table when they came in from the morning s drive 
good god cried marianne he has been here while 
we were out elinor rejoiced to be assured of his 
being in london now ventured to say depend upon it 
he will call again tomorrow but marianne seemed 
hardly to hear her and on mrs jenning s entrance 
escaped with the precious card 
this event while it raised the spirits of elinor 
restored to those of her sister all and more than all 
their former agitation from this moment her mind was 
never quiet the expectation of seeing him every hour 
of the day made her unfit for any thing she insisted 
on being left behind the next morning when the others 
went out 
elinor s thoughts were full of what might be passing 
in berkeley street during their absence but a moment s 
glance at her sister when they returned was enough to 
inform her that willoughby had paid no second visit there 
a note was just then brought in and laid on the table 
for me cried marianne stepping hastily forward 
no madam for my mistress 
but marianne not convinced took it instantly up 
it is indeed for mrs jennings how provoking 
you are expecting a letter then said elinor 
unable to be longer silent 
yes a little not much 
after a short pause you have no confidence 
in me marianne 
nay elinor this reproach from you you who have 
confidence in no one 
me returned elinor in some confusion indeed 
marianne i have nothing to tell 
nor i answered marianne with energy our situations 
then are alike we have neither of us any thing to tell 
you because you do not communicate and i because 
i conceal nothing 
elinor distressed by this charge of reserve in herself 
which she was not at liberty to do away knew not how 
under such circumstances to press for greater openness 
in marianne 
mrs jennings soon appeared and the note being 
given her she read it aloud it was from lady middleton 
announcing their arrival in conduit street the night before 
and requesting the company of her mother and cousins 
the following evening business on sir john s part 
and a violent cold on her own prevented their calling 
in berkeley street the invitation was accepted 
but when the hour of appointment drew near necessary as 
it was in common civility to mrs jennings that they 
should both attend her on such a visit elinor had some 
difficulty in persuading her sister to go for still 
she had seen nothing of willoughby and therefore was 
not more indisposed for amusement abroad than unwilling 
to run the risk of his calling again in her absence 
elinor found when the evening was over 
that disposition is not materially altered by a change 
of abode for although scarcely settled in town 
sir john had contrived to collect around him nearly twenty 
young people and to amuse them with a ball this was 
an affair however of which lady middleton did not approve 
in the country an unpremeditated dance was very allowable 
but in london where the reputation of elegance was more 
important and less easily attained it was risking too much 
for the gratification of a few girls to have it known that 
lady middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine couple 
with two violins and a mere side board collation 
mr and mrs palmer were of the party from the former 
whom they had not seen before since their arrival in town 
as he was careful to avoid the appearance of any attention 
to his mother in law and therefore never came near her 
they received no mark of recognition on their entrance 
he looked at them slightly without seeming to know 
who they were and merely nodded to mrs jennings from 
the other side of the room marianne gave one glance 
round the apartment as she entered it was enough he 
was not there and she sat down equally ill disposed 
to receive or communicate pleasure after they had been 
assembled about an hour mr palmer sauntered towards 
the miss dashwoods to express his surprise on seeing them 
in town though colonel brandon had been first informed 
of their arrival at his house and he had himself said 
something very droll on hearing that they were to come 
i thought you were both in devonshire said he 
did you replied elinor 
when do you go back again 
i do not know and thus ended their discourse 
never had marianne been so unwilling to dance 
in her life as she was that evening and never so much 
fatigued by the exercise she complained of it 
as they returned to berkeley street 
aye aye said mrs jennings we know the reason 
of all that very well if a certain person who shall 
be nameless had been there you would not have been a 
bit tired and to say the truth it was not very pretty 
of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited 
invited cried marianne 
so my daughter middleton told me for it seems sir 
john met him somewhere in the street this morning 
marianne said no more but looked exceedingly hurt 
impatient in this situation to be doing something 
that might lead to her sister s relief elinor resolved 
to write the next morning to her mother and hoped 
by awakening her fears for the health of marianne 
to procure those inquiries which had been so long delayed 
and she was still more eagerly bent on this measure 
by perceiving after breakfast on the morrow that marianne 
was again writing to willoughby for she could not suppose 
it to be to any other person 
about the middle of the day mrs jennings went out by 
herself on business and elinor began her letter directly 
while marianne too restless for employment too anxious 
for conversation walked from one window to the other 
or sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation 
elinor was very earnest in her application to her mother 
relating all that had passed her suspicions of 
willoughby s inconstancy urging her by every plea 
of duty and affection to demand from marianne an account 
of her real situation with respect to him 
her letter was scarcely finished when a rap 
foretold a visitor and colonel brandon was announced 
marianne who had seen him from the window and who hated 
company of any kind left the room before he entered it 
he looked more than usually grave and though expressing 
satisfaction at finding miss dashwood alone as if he 
had somewhat in particular to tell her sat for some 
time without saying a word elinor persuaded that he 
had some communication to make in which her sister 
was concerned impatiently expected its opening 
it was not the first time of her feeling the same kind 
of conviction for more than once before beginning with 
the observation of your sister looks unwell to day 
or your sister seems out of spirits he had appeared 
on the point either of disclosing or of inquiring 
something particular about her after a pause of several 
minutes their silence was broken by his asking her 
in a voice of some agitation when he was to congratulate 
her on the acquisition of a brother elinor was not 
prepared for such a question and having no answer ready 
was obliged to adopt the simple and common expedient 
of asking what he meant he tried to smile as he replied 
your sister s engagement to mr willoughby is very generally 
known 
it cannot be generally known returned elinor 
for her own family do not know it 
he looked surprised and said i beg your pardon 
i am afraid my inquiry has been impertinent but i had not 
supposed any secrecy intended as they openly correspond 
and their marriage is universally talked of 
how can that be by whom can you have heard 
it mentioned 
by many by some of whom you know nothing by others 
with whom you are most intimate mrs jennings mrs palmer 
and the middletons but still i might not have believed it 
for where the mind is perhaps rather unwilling to 
be convinced it will always find something to support 
its doubts if i had not when the servant let me in today 
accidentally seen a letter in his hand directed to 
mr willoughby in your sister s writing i came to inquire 
but i was convinced before i could ask the question 
is every thing finally settled is it impossible to 
but i have no right and i could have no chance of succeeding 
excuse me miss dashwood i believe i have been wrong 
in saying so much but i hardly know what to do and on 
your prudence i have the strongest dependence tell me 
that it is all absolutely resolved on that any attempt 
that in short concealment if concealment be possible 
is all that remains 
these words which conveyed to elinor a direct avowal 
of his love for her sister affected her very much 
she was not immediately able to say anything and even 
when her spirits were recovered she debated for a short 
time on the answer it would be most proper to give 
the real state of things between willoughby and her sister 
was so little known to herself that in endeavouring 
to explain it she might be as liable to say too much 
as too little yet as she was convinced that marianne s 
affection for willoughby could leave no hope of colonel 
brandon s success whatever the event of that affection 
might be and at the same time wished to shield her conduct 
from censure she thought it most prudent and kind 
after some consideration to say more than she really knew 
or believed she acknowledged therefore that though 
she had never been informed by themselves of the terms 
on which they stood with each other of their mutual 
affection she had no doubt and of their correspondence 
she was not astonished to hear 
he listened to her with silent attention and on 
her ceasing to speak rose directly from his seat 
and after saying in a voice of emotion to your sister 
i wish all imaginable happiness to willoughby that he 
may endeavour to deserve her took leave and went away 
elinor derived no comfortable feelings from this 
conversation to lessen the uneasiness of her mind on 
other points she was left on the contrary with a 
melancholy impression of colonel brandon s unhappiness 
and was prevented even from wishing it removed 
by her anxiety for the very event that must confirm it 
chapter 
nothing occurred during the next three or four days 
to make elinor regret what she had done in applying 
to her mother for willoughby neither came nor wrote 
they were engaged about the end of that time to attend 
lady middleton to a party from which mrs jennings was 
kept away by the indisposition of her youngest daughter 
and for this party marianne wholly dispirited 
careless of her appearance and seeming equally indifferent 
whether she went or staid prepared without one look 
of hope or one expression of pleasure she sat by the 
drawing room fire after tea till the moment of lady 
middleton s arrival without once stirring from her seat 
or altering her attitude lost in her own thoughts 
and insensible of her sister s presence and when at 
last they were told that lady middleton waited for them 
at the door she started as if she had forgotten that 
any one was expected 
they arrived in due time at the place of destination 
and as soon as the string of carriages before them 
would allow alighted ascended the stairs heard their 
names announced from one landing place to another in an 
audible voice and entered a room splendidly lit up 
quite full of company and insufferably hot when they had 
paid their tribute of politeness by curtsying to the lady 
of the house they were permitted to mingle in the crowd 
and take their share of the heat and inconvenience to 
which their arrival must necessarily add after some time 
spent in saying little or doing less lady middleton sat 
down to cassino and as marianne was not in spirits for 
moving about she and elinor luckily succeeding to chairs 
placed themselves at no great distance from the table 
they had not remained in this manner long before elinor 
perceived willoughby standing within a few yards 
of them in earnest conversation with a very fashionable 
looking young woman she soon caught his eye and he 
immediately bowed but without attempting to speak to her 
or to approach marianne though he could not but see her 
and then continued his discourse with the same lady 
elinor turned involuntarily to marianne to see whether 
it could be unobserved by her at that moment she first 
perceived him and her whole countenance glowing with 
sudden delight she would have moved towards him instantly 
had not her sister caught hold of her 
good heavens she exclaimed he is there he 
is there oh why does he not look at me why cannot 
i speak to him 
pray pray be composed cried elinor and do 
not betray what you feel to every body present 
perhaps he has not observed you yet 
this however was more than she could believe herself 
and to be composed at such a moment was not only beyond 
the reach of marianne it was beyond her wish she sat 
in an agony of impatience which affected every feature 
at last he turned round again and regarded them both 
she started up and pronouncing his name in a tone 
of affection held out her hand to him he approached 
and addressing himself rather to elinor than marianne 
as if wishing to avoid her eye and determined not to 
observe her attitude inquired in a hurried manner after 
mrs dashwood and asked how long they had been in town 
elinor was robbed of all presence of mind by such an address 
and was unable to say a word but the feelings of her sister 
were instantly expressed her face was crimsoned over 
and she exclaimed in a voice of the greatest emotion 
good god willoughby what is the meaning of this 
have you not received my letters will you not shake 
hands with me 
he could not then avoid it but her touch seemed 
painful to him and he held her hand only for a moment 
during all this time he was evidently struggling for composure 
elinor watched his countenance and saw its expression 
becoming more tranquil after a moment s pause he spoke 
with calmness 
i did myself the honour of calling in berkeley 
street last tuesday and very much regretted that i was 
not fortunate enough to find yourselves and mrs jennings 
at home my card was not lost i hope 
but have you not received my notes cried marianne 
in the wildest anxiety here is some mistake i am 
sure some dreadful mistake what can be the meaning 
of it tell me willoughby for heaven s sake tell me 
what is the matter 
he made no reply his complexion changed and all his 
embarrassment returned but as if on catching the eye 
of the young lady with whom he had been previously talking 
he felt the necessity of instant exertion he recovered 
himself again and after saying yes i had the pleasure 
of receiving the information of your arrival in town 
which you were so good as to send me turned hastily away 
with a slight bow and joined his friend 
marianne now looking dreadfully white and unable 
to stand sunk into her chair and elinor expecting every 
moment to see her faint tried to screen her from the 
observation of others while reviving her with lavender water 
go to him elinor she cried as soon as she 
could speak and force him to come to me tell him 
i must see him again must speak to him instantly 
i cannot rest i shall not have a moment s peace till this 
is explained some dreadful misapprehension or other 
oh go to him this moment 
how can that be done no my dearest marianne 
you must wait this is not the place for explanations 
wait only till tomorrow 
with difficulty however could she prevent her 
from following him herself and to persuade her to check 
her agitation to wait at least with the appearance 
of composure till she might speak to him with more privacy 
and more effect was impossible for marianne continued 
incessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery 
of her feelings by exclamations of wretchedness 
in a short time elinor saw willoughby quit the room by the 
door towards the staircase and telling marianne that he 
was gone urged the impossibility of speaking to him again 
that evening as a fresh argument for her to be calm 
she instantly begged her sister would entreat lady 
middleton to take them home as she was too miserable 
to stay a minute longer 
lady middleton though in the middle of a rubber 
on being informed that marianne was unwell was too 
polite to object for a moment to her wish of going away 
and making over her cards to a friend they departed 
as soon the carriage could be found scarcely a word 
was spoken during their return to berkeley street 
marianne was in a silent agony too much oppressed even 
for tears but as mrs jennings was luckily not come home 
they could go directly to their own room where hartshorn 
restored her a little to herself she was soon undressed 
and in bed and as she seemed desirous of being alone 
her sister then left her and while she waited the return 
of mrs jennings had leisure enough for thinking over 
the past 
that some kind of engagement had subsisted 
between willoughby and marianne she could not doubt 
and that willoughby was weary of it seemed equally clear 
for however marianne might still feed her own wishes 
she could not attribute such behaviour to mistake 
or misapprehension of any kind nothing but a thorough 
change of sentiment could account for it her indignation 
would have been still stronger than it was had she 
not witnessed that embarrassment which seemed to speak 
a consciousness of his own misconduct and prevented 
her from believing him so unprincipled as to have been 
sporting with the affections of her sister from the first 
without any design that would bear investigation 
absence might have weakened his regard and convenience 
might have determined him to overcome it but that such 
a regard had formerly existed she could not bring herself 
to doubt 
as for marianne on the pangs which so unhappy a meeting 
must already have given her and on those still more 
severe which might await her in its probable consequence 
she could not reflect without the deepest concern 
her own situation gained in the comparison for while she 
could esteem edward as much as ever however they might be 
divided in future her mind might be always supported 
but every circumstance that could embitter such an evil 
seemed uniting to heighten the misery of marianne 
in a final separation from willoughby in an immediate 
and irreconcilable rupture with him 
chapter 
before the house maid had lit their fire the next day 
or the sun gained any power over a cold gloomy morning 
in january marianne only half dressed was kneeling 
against one of the window seats for the sake of all 
the little light she could command from it and writing 
as fast as a continual flow of tears would permit her 
in this situation elinor roused from sleep by her agitation 
and sobs first perceived her and after observing her 
for a few moments with silent anxiety said in a tone 
of the most considerate gentleness 
marianne may i ask 
no elinor she replied ask nothing you will 
soon know all 
the sort of desperate calmness with which this was said 
lasted no longer than while she spoke and was immediately 
followed by a return of the same excessive affliction 
it was some minutes before she could go on with her letter 
and the frequent bursts of grief which still obliged her 
at intervals to withhold her pen were proofs enough of her 
feeling how more than probable it was that she was writing 
for the last time to willoughby 
elinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention 
in her power and she would have tried to sooth and 
tranquilize her still more had not marianne entreated her 
with all the eagerness of the most nervous irritability 
not to speak to her for the world in such circumstances 
it was better for both that they should not be long together 
and the restless state of marianne s mind not only prevented 
her from remaining in the room a moment after she was dressed 
but requiring at once solitude and continual change of place 
made her wander about the house till breakfast time avoiding 
the sight of every body 
at breakfast she neither ate nor attempted to eat 
any thing and elinor s attention was then all employed 
not in urging her not in pitying her nor in appearing 
to regard her but in endeavouring to engage mrs jenning s 
notice entirely to herself 
as this was a favourite meal with mrs jennings 
it lasted a considerable time and they were just setting 
themselves after it round the common working table when a 
letter was delivered to marianne which she eagerly caught 
from the servant and turning of a death like paleness 
instantly ran out of the room elinor who saw as plainly 
by this as if she had seen the direction that it must 
come from willoughby felt immediately such a sickness 
at heart as made her hardly able to hold up her head 
and sat in such a general tremour as made her fear it 
impossible to escape mrs jenning s notice that good lady 
however saw only that marianne had received a letter 
from willoughby which appeared to her a very good joke 
and which she treated accordingly by hoping with a laugh 
that she would find it to her liking of elinor s distress 
she was too busily employed in measuring lengths of worsted 
for her rug to see any thing at all and calmly continuing 
her talk as soon as marianne disappeared she said 
upon my word i never saw a young woman so 
desperately in love in my life my girls were nothing 
to her and yet they used to be foolish enough but as 
for miss marianne she is quite an altered creature 
i hope from the bottom of my heart he will not keep her 
waiting much longer for it is quite grievous to see her 
look so ill and forlorn pray when are they to be married 
elinor though never less disposed to speak than at 
that moment obliged herself to answer such an attack 
as this and therefore trying to smile replied and have 
you really madam talked yourself into a persuasion 
of my sister s being engaged to mr willoughby i thought 
it had been only a joke but so serious a question seems 
to imply more and i must beg therefore that you will not 
deceive yourself any longer i do assure you that nothing 
would surprise me more than to hear of their being going 
to be married 
for shame for shame miss dashwood how can you 
talk so do not we all know that it must be a match that 
they were over head and ears in love with each other from 
the first moment they met did not i see them together 
in devonshire every day and all day long and did not i 
know that your sister came to town with me on purpose 
to buy wedding clothes come come this will not do 
because you are so sly about it yourself you think nobody 
else has any senses but it is no such thing i can tell you 
for it has been known all over town this ever so long 
i tell every body of it and so does charlotte 
indeed madam said elinor very seriously 
you are mistaken indeed you are doing a very unkind thing 
in spreading the report and you will find that you have 
though you will not believe me now 
mrs jennings laughed again but elinor had not 
spirits to say more and eager at all events to know 
what willoughby had written hurried away to their room 
where on opening the door she saw marianne stretched on 
the bed almost choked by grief one letter in her hand 
and two or three others laying by her elinor drew near 
but without saying a word and seating herself on the bed 
took her hand kissed her affectionately several times 
and then gave way to a burst of tears which at first 
was scarcely less violent than marianne s the latter 
though unable to speak seemed to feel all the tenderness 
of this behaviour and after some time thus spent in 
joint affliction she put all the letters into elinor s hands 
and then covering her face with her handkerchief 
almost screamed with agony elinor who knew that such grief 
shocking as it was to witness it must have its course 
watched by her till this excess of suffering had somewhat 
spent itself and then turning eagerly to willoughby s letter 
read as follows 
bond street january 
my dear madam 
i have just had the honour of receiving your 
letter for which i beg to return my sincere 
acknowledgments i am much concerned to find there 
was anything in my behaviour last night that did 
not meet your approbation and though i am quite at 
a loss to discover in what point i could be so 
unfortunate as to offend you i entreat your 
forgiveness of what i can assure you to have been 
perfectly unintentional i shall never reflect on 
my former acquaintance with your family in devonshire 
without the most grateful pleasure and flatter 
myself it will not be broken by any mistake or 
misapprehension of my actions my esteem for your 
whole family is very sincere but if i have been so 
unfortunate as to give rise to a belief of more than 
i felt or meant to express i shall reproach myself 
for not having been more guarded in my professions 
of that esteem that i should ever have meant more 
you will allow to be impossible when you understand 
that my affections have been long engaged elsewhere 
and it will not be many weeks i believe before 
this engagement is fulfilled it is with great 
regret that i obey your commands in returning the 
letters with which i have been honoured from you 
and the lock of hair which you so obligingly bestowed 
on me 
i am dear madam 
your most obedient 
humble servant 
john willoughby 
with what indignation such a letter as this must 
be read by miss dashwood may be imagined though aware 
before she began it that it must bring a confession 
of his inconstancy and confirm their separation for ever 
she was not aware that such language could be suffered 
to announce it nor could she have supposed willoughby 
capable of departing so far from the appearance of every 
honourable and delicate feeling so far from the common 
decorum of a gentleman as to send a letter so impudently 
cruel a letter which instead of bringing with his desire 
of a release any professions of regret acknowledged no 
breach of faith denied all peculiar affection whatever 
a letter of which every line was an insult and which 
proclaimed its writer to be deep in hardened villainy 
she paused over it for some time with indignant 
astonishment then read it again and again but every 
perusal only served to increase her abhorrence of the man 
and so bitter were her feelings against him that she 
dared not trust herself to speak lest she might wound 
marianne still deeper by treating their disengagement 
not as a loss to her of any possible good but as an 
escape from the worst and most irremediable of all 
evils a connection for life with an unprincipled man 
as a deliverance the most real a blessing the most important 
in her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter 
on the depravity of that mind which could dictate it 
and probably on the very different mind of a very different 
person who had no other connection whatever with the affair 
than what her heart gave him with every thing that passed 
elinor forgot the immediate distress of her sister 
forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread 
and so entirely forgot how long she had been in the room 
that when on hearing a carriage drive up to the door 
she went to the window to see who could be coming so 
unreasonably early she was all astonishment to perceive 
mrs jennings s chariot which she knew had not been 
ordered till one determined not to quit marianne 
though hopeless of contributing at present to her ease 
she hurried away to excuse herself from attending 
mrs jennings on account of her sister being indisposed 
mrs jennings with a thoroughly good humoured concern 
for its because admitted the excuse most readily and elinor 
after seeing her safe off returned to marianne whom she 
found attempting to rise from the bed and whom she reached 
just in time to prevent her from falling on the floor 
faint and giddy from a long want of proper rest and food 
for it was many days since she had any appetite and many 
nights since she had really slept and now when her 
mind was no longer supported by the fever of suspense 
the consequence of all this was felt in an aching head 
a weakened stomach and a general nervous faintness 
a glass of wine which elinor procured for her directly 
made her more comfortable and she was at last able to express 
some sense of her kindness by saying 
poor elinor how unhappy i make you 
i only wish replied her sister there were 
any thing i could do which might be of comfort to you 
this as every thing else would have been 
was too much for marianne who could only exclaim 
in the anguish of her heart oh elinor i am miserable 
indeed before her voice was entirely lost in sobs 
elinor could no longer witness this torrent 
of unresisted grief in silence 
exert yourself dear marianne she cried 
if you would not kill yourself and all who love you 
think of your mother think of her misery while you suffer 
for her sake you must exert yourself 
i cannot i cannot cried marianne leave me 
leave me if i distress you leave me hate me forget me 
but do not torture me so oh how easy for those 
who have no sorrow of their own to talk of exertion happy 
happy elinor you cannot have an idea of what i suffer 
do you call me happy marianne ah if you knew and 
can you believe me to be so while i see you so wretched 
forgive me forgive me throwing her arms round 
her sister s neck i know you feel for me i know what 
a heart you have but yet you are you must be happy 
edward loves you what oh what can do away such happiness 
as that 
many many circumstances said elinor solemnly 
no no no cried marianne wildly he loves you 
and only you you can have no grief 
i can have no pleasure while i see you in this state 
and you will never see me otherwise mine is 
a misery which nothing can do away 
you must not talk so marianne have you no 
comforts no friends is your loss such as leaves 
no opening for consolation much as you suffer now 
think of what you would have suffered if the discovery 
of his character had been delayed to a later period 
if your engagement had been carried on for months and months 
as it might have been before he chose to put an end to it 
every additional day of unhappy confidence on your side 
would have made the blow more dreadful 
engagement cried marianne there has been 
no engagement 
no engagement 
no he is not so unworthy as you believe him 
he has broken no faith with me 
but he told you that he loved you 
yes no never absolutely it was every day implied 
but never professedly declared sometimes i thought it 
had been but it never was 
yet you wrote to him 
yes could that be wrong after all that had passed 
but i cannot talk 
elinor said no more and turning again to the three 
letters which now raised a much stronger curiosity 
than before directly ran over the contents of all 
the first which was what her sister had sent him 
on their arrival in town was to this effect 
berkeley street january 
how surprised you will be willoughby on 
receiving this and i think you will feel something 
more than surprise when you know that i am in town 
an opportunity of coming hither though with mrs 
jennings was a temptation we could not resist 
i wish you may receive this in time to come here 
to night but i will not depend on it at any rate 
i shall expect you to morrow for the present adieu 
m d 
her second note which had been written on the morning 
after the dance at the middletons was in these words 
i cannot express my disappointment in having 
missed you the day before yesterday nor my astonishment 
at not having received any answer to a note which 
i sent you above a week ago i have been expecting 
to hear from you and still more to see you every 
hour of the day pray call again as soon as possible 
and explain the reason of my having expected this 
in vain you had better come earlier another time 
because we are generally out by one we were last 
night at lady middleton s where there was a dance 
i have been told that you were asked to be of the 
party but could it be so you must be very much 
altered indeed since we parted if that could be 
the case and you not there but i will not suppose 
this possible and i hope very soon to receive your 
personal assurance of its being otherwise 
m d 
the contents of her last note to him were these 
what am i to imagine willoughby by your 
behaviour last night again i demand an explanation 
of it i was prepared to meet you with the pleasure 
which our separation naturally produced with the 
familiarity which our intimacy at barton appeared 
to me to justify i was repulsed indeed i have 
passed a wretched night in endeavouring to excuse 
a conduct which can scarcely be called less than 
insulting but though i have not yet been able to 
form any reasonable apology for your behaviour 
i am perfectly ready to hear your justification of 
it you have perhaps been misinformed or purposely 
deceived in something concerning me which may have 
lowered me in your opinion tell me what it is 
explain the grounds on which you acted and i shall 
be satisfied in being able to satisfy you it 
would grieve me indeed to be obliged to think ill 
of you but if i am to do it if i am to learn that 
you are not what we have hitherto believed you that 
your regard for us all was insincere that your 
behaviour to me was intended only to deceive let 
it be told as soon as possible my feelings are at 
present in a state of dreadful indecision i wish 
to acquit you but certainty on either side will be 
ease to what i now suffer if your sentiments are 
no longer what they were you will return my notes 
and the lock of my hair which is in your possession 
m d 
that such letters so full of affection and confidence 
could have been so answered elinor for willoughby s sake 
would have been unwilling to believe but her condemnation 
of him did not blind her to the impropriety of their 
having been written at all and she was silently grieving 
over the imprudence which had hazarded such unsolicited 
proofs of tenderness not warranted by anything preceding 
and most severely condemned by the event when marianne 
perceiving that she had finished the letters observed to 
her that they contained nothing but what any one would 
have written in the same situation 
i felt myself she added to be as solemnly 
engaged to him as if the strictest legal covenant 
had bound us to each other 
i can believe it said elinor but unfortunately 
he did not feel the same 
he did feel the same elinor for weeks and weeks he 
felt it i know he did whatever may have changed him now and 
nothing but the blackest art employed against me can have done 
it i was once as dear to him as my own soul could wish 
this lock of hair which now he can so readily give up 
was begged of me with the most earnest supplication 
had you seen his look his manner had you heard his voice 
at that moment have you forgot the last evening of our 
being together at barton the morning that we parted 
too when he told me that it might be many weeks before 
we met again his distress can i ever forget his distress 
for a moment or two she could say no more 
but when this emotion had passed away she added 
in a firmer tone 
elinor i have been cruelly used but not by willoughby 
dearest marianne who but himself by whom can he 
have been instigated 
by all the world rather than by his own heart 
i could rather believe every creature of my acquaintance 
leagued together to ruin me in his opinion than believe 
his nature capable of such cruelty this woman of whom he 
writes whoever she be or any one in short but your own 
dear self mama and edward may have been so barbarous 
to bely me beyond you three is there a creature 
in the world whom i would not rather suspect of evil 
than willoughby whose heart i know so well 
elinor would not contend and only replied 
whoever may have been so detestably your enemy let them 
be cheated of their malignant triumph my dear sister 
by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own 
innocence and good intentions supports your spirits 
it is a reasonable and laudable pride which resists 
such malevolence 
no no cried marianne misery such as mine has 
no pride i care not who knows that i am wretched 
the triumph of seeing me so may be open to all the world 
elinor elinor they who suffer little may be proud and 
independent as they like may resist insult or return 
mortification but i cannot i must feel i must be 
wretched and they are welcome to enjoy the consciousness 
of it that can 
but for my mother s sake and mine 
i would do more than for my own but to appear 
happy when i am so miserable oh who can require it 
again they were both silent elinor was employed 
in walking thoughtfully from the fire to the window 
from the window to the fire without knowing that she 
received warmth from one or discerning objects through 
the other and marianne seated at the foot of the bed 
with her head leaning against one of its posts 
again took up willoughby s letter and after shuddering 
over every sentence exclaimed 
it is too much oh willoughby willoughby could this 
be yours cruel cruel nothing can acquit you elinor 
nothing can whatever he might have heard against me 
ought he not to have suspended his belief ought he not to 
have told me of it to have given me the power of clearing 
myself the lock of hair repeating it from the letter 
which you so obligingly bestowed on me that is unpardonable 
willoughby where was your heart when you wrote those words 
oh barbarously insolent elinor can he be justified 
no marianne in no possible way 
and yet this woman who knows what her art may 
have been how long it may have been premeditated 
and how deeply contrived by her who is she who can 
she be whom did i ever hear him talk of as young and 
attractive among his female acquaintance oh no one 
no one he talked to me only of myself 
another pause ensued marianne was greatly agitated 
and it ended thus 
elinor i must go home i must go and comfort mama 
can not we be gone to morrow 
to morrow marianne 
yes why should i stay here i came only for 
willoughby s sake and now who cares for me who regards me 
it would be impossible to go to morrow we owe 
mrs jennings much more than civility and civility of 
the commonest kind must prevent such a hasty removal as that 
well then another day or two perhaps but i cannot 
stay here long i cannot stay to endure the questions 
and remarks of all these people the middletons and 
palmers how am i to bear their pity the pity of such 
a woman as lady middleton oh what would he say to that 
elinor advised her to lie down again and for a 
moment she did so but no attitude could give her ease 
and in restless pain of mind and body she moved from one 
posture to another till growing more and more hysterical 
her sister could with difficulty keep her on the bed at all 
and for some time was fearful of being constrained to call 
for assistance some lavender drops however which she 
was at length persuaded to take were of use and from 
that time till mrs jennings returned she continued 
on the bed quiet and motionless 
chapter 
mrs jennings came immediately to their room on her return 
and without waiting to have her request of admittance answered 
opened the door and walked in with a look of real concern 
how do you do my dear said she in a voice of great 
compassion to marianne who turned away her face without 
attempting to answer 
how is she miss dashwood poor thing she looks very bad 
no wonder ay it is but too true he is to be married 
very soon a good for nothing fellow i have no patience 
with him mrs taylor told me of it half an hour ago 
and she was told it by a particular friend of miss 
grey herself else i am sure i should not have believed it 
and i was almost ready to sink as it was well said i 
all i can say is that if this be true he has used 
a young lady of my acquaintance abominably ill and i 
wish with all my soul his wife may plague his heart out 
and so i shall always say my dear you may depend on it 
i have no notion of men s going on in this way and if ever 
i meet him again i will give him such a dressing as he 
has not had this many a day but there is one comfort 
my dear miss marianne he is not the only young man 
in the world worth having and with your pretty face 
you will never want admirers well poor thing i will not 
disturb her any longer for she had better have her cry 
out at once and have done with the parrys and sandersons 
luckily are coming tonight you know and that will amuse her 
she then went away walking on tiptoe out of the room 
as if she supposed her young friend s affliction could 
be increased by noise 
marianne to the surprise of her sister 
determined on dining with them elinor even advised 
her against it but no she would go down she could 
bear it very well and the bustle about her would 
be less elinor pleased to have her governed for a 
moment by such a motive though believing it hardly 
possible that she could sit out the dinner said no more 
and adjusting her dress for her as well as she could 
while marianne still remained on the bed was ready 
to assist her into the dining room as soon as they were 
summoned to it 
when there though looking most wretchedly 
she ate more and was calmer than her sister had expected 
had she tried to speak or had she been conscious of half 
mrs jennings s well meant but ill judged attentions 
to her this calmness could not have been maintained 
but not a syllable escaped her lips and the abstraction 
of her thoughts preserved her in ignorance of every thing 
that was passing before her 
elinor who did justice to mrs jennings s kindness 
though its effusions were often distressing and sometimes 
almost ridiculous made her those acknowledgments 
and returned her those civilities which her sister could 
not make or return for herself their good friend saw 
that marianne was unhappy and felt that every thing 
was due to her which might make her at all less so 
she treated her therefore with all the indulgent fondness 
of a parent towards a favourite child on the last day of 
its holidays marianne was to have the best place by the fire 
was to be tempted to eat by every delicacy in the house 
and to be amused by the relation of all the news of the day 
had not elinor in the sad countenance of her sister 
seen a check to all mirth she could have been entertained 
by mrs jennings s endeavours to cure a disappointment in love 
by a variety of sweetmeats and olives and a good fire 
as soon however as the consciousness of all this was 
forced by continual repetition on marianne she could 
stay no longer with a hasty exclamation of misery 
and a sign to her sister not to follow her she directly got 
up and hurried out of the room 
poor soul cried mrs jennings as soon as she was gone 
how it grieves me to see her and i declare if she is 
not gone away without finishing her wine and the dried 
cherries too lord nothing seems to do her any good 
i am sure if i knew of any thing she would like i would 
send all over the town for it well it is the oddest 
thing to me that a man should use such a pretty girl 
so ill but when there is plenty of money on one side 
and next to none on the other lord bless you they care 
no more about such things 
the lady then miss grey i think you called her 
is very rich 
fifty thousand pounds my dear did you ever see 
her a smart stylish girl they say but not handsome 
i remember her aunt very well biddy henshawe she married 
a very wealthy man but the family are all rich together 
fifty thousand pounds and by all accounts it will not come 
before it is wanted for they say he is all to pieces 
no wonder dashing about with his curricle and hunters 
well it do not signify talking but when a young man 
be who he will comes and makes love to a pretty girl 
and promises marriage he has no business to fly off 
from his word only because he grows poor and a richer 
girl is ready to have him why do not he in such a case 
sell his horses let his house turn off his servants 
and make a thorough reform at once i warrant you 
miss marianne would have been ready to wait till matters 
came round but that will not do now a days nothing in the 
way of pleasure can ever be given up by the young men of 
this age 
do you know what kind of a girl miss grey is 
is she said to be amiable 
i never heard any harm of her indeed i hardly ever 
heard her mentioned except that mrs taylor did say 
this morning that one day miss walker hinted to her 
that she believed mr and mrs ellison would not be sorry 
to have miss grey married for she and mrs ellison could 
never agree 
and who are the ellisons 
her guardians my dear but now she is of age 
and may choose for herself and a pretty choice she has 
made what now after pausing a moment your poor sister 
is gone to her own room i suppose to moan by herself 
is there nothing one can get to comfort her poor dear 
it seems quite cruel to let her be alone well by and by we 
shall have a few friends and that will amuse her a little 
what shall we play at she hates whist i know but is there 
no round game she cares for 
dear madam this kindness is quite unnecessary 
marianne i dare say will not leave her room again 
this evening i shall persuade her if i can to go 
early to bed for i am sure she wants rest 
aye i believe that will be best for her let her name 
her own supper and go to bed lord no wonder she has 
been looking so bad and so cast down this last week or two 
for this matter i suppose has been hanging over her head as 
long as that and so the letter that came today finished it 
poor soul i am sure if i had had a notion of it 
i would not have joked her about it for all my money 
but then you know how should i guess such a thing i made 
sure of its being nothing but a common love letter and 
you know young people like to be laughed at about them lord 
how concerned sir john and my daughters will be when they 
hear it if i had my senses about me i might have called 
in conduit street in my way home and told them of it 
but i shall see them tomorrow 
it would be unnecessary i am sure for you to caution 
mrs palmer and sir john against ever naming mr willoughby 
or making the slightest allusion to what has passed 
before my sister their own good nature must point out 
to them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing 
about it when she is present and the less that may ever 
be said to myself on the subject the more my feelings 
will be spared as you my dear madam will easily believe 
oh lord yes that i do indeed it must be terrible 
for you to hear it talked of and as for your sister 
i am sure i would not mention a word about it to her 
for the world you saw i did not all dinner time 
no more would sir john nor my daughters for they are 
all very thoughtful and considerate especially if i 
give them a hint as i certainly will for my part 
i think the less that is said about such things the better 
the sooner it is blown over and forgot and what does 
talking ever do you know 
in this affair it can only do harm more so 
perhaps than in many cases of a similar kind for it 
has been attended by circumstances which for the sake 
of every one concerned in it make it unfit to become 
the public conversation i must do this justice to 
mr willoughby he has broken no positive engagement 
with my sister 
law my dear do not pretend to defend him 
no positive engagement indeed after taking her all 
over allenham house and fixing on the very rooms they 
were to live in hereafter 
elinor for her sister s sake could not press the 
subject farther and she hoped it was not required of her 
for willoughby s since though marianne might lose much 
he could gain very little by the enforcement of the real truth 
after a short silence on both sides mrs jennings 
with all her natural hilarity burst forth again 
well my dear it is a true saying about an ill wind 
for it will be all the better for colonel brandon 
he will have her at last aye that he will mind me 
now if they an t married by mid summer lord how he will 
chuckle over this news i hope he will come tonight 
it will be all to one a better match for your sister 
two thousand a year without debt or drawback except 
the little love child indeed aye i had forgot her 
but she may be prenticed out at a small cost and then 
what does it signify delaford is a nice place i can 
tell you exactly what i call a nice old fashioned place 
full of comforts and conveniences quite shut in with great 
garden walls that are covered with the best fruit trees 
in the country and such a mulberry tree in one corner 
lord how charlotte and i did stuff the only time we 
were there then there is a dove cote some delightful 
stew ponds and a very pretty canal and every thing 
in short that one could wish for and moreover it is 
close to the church and only a quarter of a mile from 
the turnpike road so it is never dull for if you only 
go and sit up in an old yew arbour behind the house 
you may see all the carriages that pass along 
oh it is a nice place a butcher hard by in the village 
and the parsonage house within a stone s throw 
to my fancy a thousand times prettier than barton park 
where they are forced to send three miles for their meat 
and have not a neighbour nearer than your mother 
well i shall spirit up the colonel as soon as i can 
one shoulder of mutton you know drives another down 
if we can but put willoughby out of her head 
ay if we can do that madam said elinor 
we shall do very well with or without colonel brandon 
and then rising she went away to join marianne 
whom she found as she expected in her own room leaning 
in silent misery over the small remains of a fire 
which till elinor s entrance had been her only light 
you had better leave me was all the notice 
that her sister received from her 
i will leave you said elinor if you will go 
to bed but this from the momentary perverseness 
of impatient suffering she at first refused to do 
her sister s earnest though gentle persuasion however 
soon softened her to compliance and elinor saw her 
lay her aching head on the pillow and as she hoped 
in a way to get some quiet rest before she left her 
in the drawing room whither she then repaired 
she was soon joined by mrs jennings with a wine glass 
full of something in her hand 
my dear said she entering i have just recollected 
that i have some of the finest old constantia wine in the 
house that ever was tasted so i have brought a glass of it 
for your sister my poor husband how fond he was of it 
whenever he had a touch of his old colicky gout he said 
it did him more good than any thing else in the world 
do take it to your sister 
dear madam replied elinor smiling at the difference 
of the complaints for which it was recommended how good 
you are but i have just left marianne in bed and i hope 
almost asleep and as i think nothing will be of so much 
service to her as rest if you will give me leave 
i will drink the wine myself 
mrs jennings though regretting that she had not been 
five minutes earlier was satisfied with the compromise 
and elinor as she swallowed the chief of it reflected 
that though its effects on a colicky gout were at present 
of little importance to her its healing powers 
on a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried 
on herself as on her sister 
colonel brandon came in while the party were at tea 
and by his manner of looking round the room for marianne 
elinor immediately fancied that he neither expected 
nor wished to see her there and in short that he 
was already aware of what occasioned her absence 
mrs jennings was not struck by the same thought 
for soon after his entrance she walked across the room 
to the tea table where elinor presided and whispered 
the colonel looks as grave as ever you see he knows 
nothing of it do tell him my dear 
he shortly afterwards drew a chair close to her s 
and with a look which perfectly assured her of his 
good information inquired after her sister 
marianne is not well said she she has been 
indisposed all day and we have persuaded her to go to bed 
perhaps then he hesitatingly replied what i 
heard this morning may be there may be more truth in it 
than i could believe possible at first 
what did you hear 
that a gentleman whom i had reason to think in short 
that a man whom i knew to be engaged but how shall i 
tell you if you know it already as surely you must 
i may be spared 
you mean answered elinor with forced calmness 
mr willoughby s marriage with miss grey yes we do 
know it all this seems to have been a day of general 
elucidation for this very morning first unfolded it to us 
mr willoughby is unfathomable where did you hear it 
in a stationer s shop in pall mall where i 
had business two ladies were waiting for their carriage 
and one of them was giving the other an account of the 
intended match in a voice so little attempting concealment 
that it was impossible for me not to hear all the name 
of willoughby john willoughby frequently repeated 
first caught my attention and what followed was a positive 
assertion that every thing was now finally settled 
respecting his marriage with miss grey it was no longer 
to be a secret it would take place even within a few weeks 
with many particulars of preparations and other matters 
one thing especially i remember because it served 
to identify the man still more as soon as the ceremony 
was over they were to go to combe magna his seat 
in somersetshire my astonishment but it would be 
impossible to describe what i felt the communicative 
lady i learnt on inquiry for i stayed in the shop 
till they were gone was a mrs ellison and that as i 
have been since informed is the name of miss grey s guardian 
it is but have you likewise heard that miss grey 
has fifty thousand pounds in that if in any thing 
we may find an explanation 
it may be so but willoughby is capable at least 
i think he stopped a moment then added in a voice 
which seemed to distrust itself and your sister 
how did she 
her sufferings have been very severe i have 
only to hope that they may be proportionately short 
it has been it is a most cruel affliction till yesterday 
i believe she never doubted his regard and even now 
perhaps but i am almost convinced that he never was 
really attached to her he has been very deceitful and 
in some points there seems a hardness of heart about him 
ah said colonel brandon there is indeed but 
your sister does not i think you said so she does 
not consider quite as you do 
you know her disposition and may believe how eagerly 
she would still justify him if she could 
he made no answer and soon afterwards by the removal 
of the tea things and the arrangement of the card parties 
the subject was necessarily dropped mrs jennings who had 
watched them with pleasure while they were talking and who 
expected to see the effect of miss dashwood s communication 
in such an instantaneous gaiety on colonel brandon s side 
as might have become a man in the bloom of youth of hope 
and happiness saw him with amazement remain the whole 
evening more serious and thoughtful than usual 
chapter 
from a night of more sleep than she had expected 
marianne awoke the next morning to the same consciousness 
of misery in which she had closed her eyes 
elinor encouraged her as much as possible to talk 
of what she felt and before breakfast was ready they had 
gone through the subject again and again and with the same 
steady conviction and affectionate counsel on elinor s side 
the same impetuous feelings and varying opinions on 
marianne s as before sometimes she could believe 
willoughby to be as unfortunate and as innocent as herself 
and at others lost every consolation in the impossibility 
of acquitting him at one moment she was absolutely 
indifferent to the observation of all the world at another 
she would seclude herself from it for ever and at a third 
could resist it with energy in one thing however 
she was uniform when it came to the point in avoiding 
where it was possible the presence of mrs jennings 
and in a determined silence when obliged to endure it 
her heart was hardened against the belief of mrs jennings s 
entering into her sorrows with any compassion 
no no no it cannot be she cried 
she cannot feel her kindness is not sympathy 
her good nature is not tenderness all that she wants 
is gossip and she only likes me now because i supply it 
elinor had not needed this to be assured of the injustice 
to which her sister was often led in her opinion of others 
by the irritable refinement of her own mind and the too 
great importance placed by her on the delicacies of a 
strong sensibility and the graces of a polished manner 
like half the rest of the world if more than half there 
be that are clever and good marianne with excellent 
abilities and an excellent disposition was neither 
reasonable nor candid she expected from other people 
the same opinions and feelings as her own and she judged 
of their motives by the immediate effect of their actions 
on herself thus a circumstance occurred while the 
sisters were together in their own room after breakfast 
which sunk the heart of mrs jennings still lower 
in her estimation because through her own weakness 
it chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself 
though mrs jennings was governed in it by an impulse 
of the utmost goodwill 
with a letter in her outstretched hand and countenance 
gaily smiling from the persuasion of bringing comfort 
she entered their room saying 
now my dear i bring you something that i am sure 
will do you good 
marianne heard enough in one moment her imagination 
placed before her a letter from willoughby full of tenderness 
and contrition explanatory of all that had passed satisfactory 
convincing and instantly followed by willoughby himself 
rushing eagerly into the room to inforce at her feet 
by the eloquence of his eyes the assurances of his letter 
the work of one moment was destroyed by the next 
the hand writing of her mother never till then unwelcome 
was before her and in the acuteness of the disappointment 
which followed such an ecstasy of more than hope 
she felt as if till that instant she had never suffered 
the cruelty of mrs jennings no language within 
her reach in her moments of happiest eloquence 
could have expressed and now she could reproach her 
only by the tears which streamed from her eyes with 
passionate violence a reproach however so entirely 
lost on its object that after many expressions of pity 
she withdrew still referring her to the letter of comfort 
but the letter when she was calm enough to read it 
brought little comfort willoughby filled every page 
her mother still confident of their engagement and relying 
as warmly as ever on his constancy had only been roused 
by elinor s application to intreat from marianne greater 
openness towards them both and this with such tenderness 
towards her such affection for willoughby and such 
a conviction of their future happiness in each other 
that she wept with agony through the whole of it 
all her impatience to be at home again now returned 
her mother was dearer to her than ever dearer through 
the very excess of her mistaken confidence in willoughby 
and she was wildly urgent to be gone elinor unable herself 
to determine whether it were better for marianne to be 
in london or at barton offered no counsel of her own 
except of patience till their mother s wishes could be known 
and at length she obtained her sister s consent to wait 
for that knowledge 
mrs jennings left them earlier than usual for she 
could not be easy till the middletons and palmers were able 
to grieve as much as herself and positively refusing 
elinor s offered attendance went out alone for the rest 
of the morning elinor with a very heavy heart aware of 
the pain she was going to communicate and perceiving 
by marianne s letter how ill she had succeeded in laying 
any foundation for it then sat down to write her mother 
an account of what had passed and entreat her directions 
for the future while marianne who came into the drawing room 
on mrs jennings s going away remained fixed at the table 
where elinor wrote watching the advancement of her pen 
grieving over her for the hardship of such a task 
and grieving still more fondly over its effect on her mother 
in this manner they had continued about a quarter 
of an hour when marianne whose nerves could not then 
bear any sudden noise was startled by a rap at the door 
who can this be cried elinor so early too i 
thought we had been safe 
marianne moved to the window 
it is colonel brandon said she with vexation 
we are never safe from him 
he will not come in as mrs jennings is from home 
i will not trust to that retreating to her own room 
a man who has nothing to do with his own time has no 
conscience in his intrusion on that of others 
the event proved her conjecture right though it 
was founded on injustice and error for colonel brandon 
did come in and elinor who was convinced that 
solicitude for marianne brought him thither and who saw 
that solicitude in his disturbed and melancholy look 
and in his anxious though brief inquiry after her 
could not forgive her sister for esteeming him so lightly 
i met mrs jennings in bond street said he 
after the first salutation and she encouraged me 
to come on and i was the more easily encouraged 
because i thought it probable that i might find you alone 
which i was very desirous of doing my object my 
wish my sole wish in desiring it i hope i believe 
it is is to be a means of giving comfort no i must 
not say comfort not present comfort but conviction 
lasting conviction to your sister s mind my regard for her 
for yourself for your mother will you allow me to prove it 
by relating some circumstances which nothing but a very 
sincere regard nothing but an earnest desire of being 
useful i think i am justified though where so many hours 
have been spent in convincing myself that i am right 
is there not some reason to fear i may be wrong 
he stopped 
i understand you said elinor you have something 
to tell me of mr willoughby that will open his character 
farther your telling it will be the greatest act of friendship 
that can be shewn marianne my gratitude will be insured 
immediately by any information tending to that end and hers 
must be gained by it in time pray pray let me hear it 
you shall and to be brief when i quitted barton 
last october but this will give you no idea i must go 
farther back you will find me a very awkward narrator 
miss dashwood i hardly know where to begin a short 
account of myself i believe will be necessary and it 
shall be a short one on such a subject sighing heavily 
can i have little temptation to be diffuse 
he stopt a moment for recollection and then 
with another sigh went on 
you have probably entirely forgotten a conversation 
it is not to be supposed that it could make any impression 
on you a conversation between us one evening at barton 
park it was the evening of a dance in which i alluded 
to a lady i had once known as resembling in some measure 
your sister marianne 
indeed answered elinor i have not forgotten it 
he looked pleased by this remembrance and added 
if i am not deceived by the uncertainty the partiality 
of tender recollection there is a very strong resemblance 
between them as well in mind as person the same warmth 
of heart the same eagerness of fancy and spirits 
this lady was one of my nearest relations an orphan from 
her infancy and under the guardianship of my father 
our ages were nearly the same and from our earliest years 
we were playfellows and friends i cannot remember the 
time when i did not love eliza and my affection for her 
as we grew up was such as perhaps judging from my 
present forlorn and cheerless gravity you might think me 
incapable of having ever felt her s for me was i believe 
fervent as the attachment of your sister to mr willoughby 
and it was though from a different because no less unfortunate 
at seventeen she was lost to me for ever she was 
married married against her inclination to my brother 
her fortune was large and our family estate much encumbered 
and this i fear is all that can be said for the 
conduct of one who was at once her uncle and guardian 
my brother did not deserve her he did not even love her 
i had hoped that her regard for me would support her 
under any difficulty and for some time it did but at 
last the misery of her situation for she experienced 
great unkindness overcame all her resolution and though 
she had promised me that nothing but how blindly i 
relate i have never told you how this was brought on 
we were within a few hours of eloping together for scotland 
the treachery or the folly of my cousin s maid betrayed us 
i was banished to the house of a relation far distant 
and she was allowed no liberty no society no amusement 
till my father s point was gained i had depended on her 
fortitude too far and the blow was a severe one 
but had her marriage been happy so young as i then was 
a few months must have reconciled me to it or at least 
i should not have now to lament it this however 
was not the case my brother had no regard for her 
his pleasures were not what they ought to have been 
and from the first he treated her unkindly the consequence 
of this upon a mind so young so lively so inexperienced 
as mrs brandon s was but too natural she resigned 
herself at first to all the misery of her situation 
and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those 
regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned but can we 
wonder that with such a husband to provoke inconstancy 
and without a friend to advise or restrain her for 
my father lived only a few months after their marriage 
and i was with my regiment in the east indies she 
should fall had i remained in england perhaps but i 
meant to promote the happiness of both by removing 
from her for years and for that purpose had procured 
my exchange the shock which her marriage had given me 
he continued in a voice of great agitation was of 
trifling weight was nothing to what i felt when i heard 
about two years afterwards of her divorce it was 
that which threw this gloom even now the recollection 
of what i suffered 
he could say no more and rising hastily walked for a few 
minutes about the room elinor affected by his relation 
and still more by his distress could not speak he saw 
her concern and coming to her took her hand pressed it 
and kissed it with grateful respect a few minutes more 
of silent exertion enabled him to proceed with composure 
it was nearly three years after this unhappy 
period before i returned to england my first care 
when i did arrive was of course to seek for her 
but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy 
i could not trace her beyond her first seducer and there 
was every reason to fear that she had removed from him 
only to sink deeper in a life of sin her legal allowance 
was not adequate to her fortune nor sufficient for her 
comfortable maintenance and i learnt from my brother that 
the power of receiving it had been made over some months 
before to another person he imagined and calmly could he 
imagine it that her extravagance and consequent distress 
had obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief 
at last however and after i had been six months in england 
i did find her regard for a former servant of my own 
who had since fallen into misfortune carried me to visit 
him in a spunging house where he was confined for debt 
and there the same house under a similar confinement 
was my unfortunate sister so altered so faded worn 
down by acute suffering of every kind hardly could i 
believe the melancholy and sickly figure before me 
to be the remains of the lovely blooming healthful girl 
on whom i had once doted what i endured in so beholding 
her but i have no right to wound your feelings by attempting 
to describe it i have pained you too much already 
that she was to all appearance in the last stage 
of a consumption was yes in such a situation it was 
my greatest comfort life could do nothing for her 
beyond giving time for a better preparation for death 
and that was given i saw her placed in comfortable lodgings 
and under proper attendants i visited her every day 
during the rest of her short life i was with her in her 
last moments 
again he stopped to recover himself and elinor 
spoke her feelings in an exclamation of tender concern 
at the fate of his unfortunate friend 
your sister i hope cannot be offended said he 
by the resemblance i have fancied between her and my 
poor disgraced relation their fates their fortunes 
cannot be the same and had the natural sweet 
disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind 
or a happier marriage she might have been all that you 
will live to see the other be but to what does all this 
lead i seem to have been distressing you for nothing 
ah miss dashwood a subject such as this untouched 
for fourteen years it is dangerous to handle it at all 
i will be more collected more concise she left to my care 
her only child a little girl the offspring of her first 
guilty connection who was then about three years old 
she loved the child and had always kept it with her 
it was a valued a precious trust to me and gladly 
would i have discharged it in the strictest sense 
by watching over her education myself had the nature 
of our situations allowed it but i had no family no home 
and my little eliza was therefore placed at school 
i saw her there whenever i could and after the death of my 
brother which happened about five years ago and which 
left to me the possession of the family property she 
visited me at delaford i called her a distant relation 
but i am well aware that i have in general been suspected 
of a much nearer connection with her it is now three 
years ago she had just reached her fourteenth year 
that i removed her from school to place her under the care 
of a very respectable woman residing in dorsetshire 
who had the charge of four or five other girls of about 
the same time of life and for two years i had every reason 
to be pleased with her situation but last february 
almost a twelvemonth back she suddenly disappeared 
i had allowed her imprudently as it has since turned 
out at her earnest desire to go to bath with one of 
her young friends who was attending her father there 
for his health i knew him to be a very good sort of man 
and i thought well of his daughter better than she deserved 
for with a most obstinate and ill judged secrecy 
she would tell nothing would give no clue though she 
certainly knew all he her father a well meaning 
but not a quick sighted man could really i believe 
give no information for he had been generally confined 
to the house while the girls were ranging over the town 
and making what acquaintance they chose and he tried 
to convince me as thoroughly as he was convinced himself 
of his daughter s being entirely unconcerned in the business 
in short i could learn nothing but that she was gone 
all the rest for eight long months was left to conjecture 
what i thought what i feared may be imagined and what i 
suffered too 
good heavens cried elinor could it be could 
willoughby 
the first news that reached me of her he continued 
came in a letter from herself last october 
it was forwarded to me from delaford and i received it 
on the very morning of our intended party to whitwell 
and this was the reason of my leaving barton so suddenly 
which i am sure must at the time have appeared strange 
to every body and which i believe gave offence to some 
little did mr willoughby imagine i suppose when his 
looks censured me for incivility in breaking up the party 
that i was called away to the relief of one whom he 
had made poor and miserable but had he known it 
what would it have availed would he have been less 
gay or less happy in the smiles of your sister no 
he had already done that which no man who can feel 
for another would do he had left the girl whose 
youth and innocence he had seduced in a situation of 
the utmost distress with no creditable home no help 
no friends ignorant of his address he had left her 
promising to return he neither returned nor wrote 
nor relieved her 
this is beyond every thing exclaimed elinor 
his character is now before you expensive dissipated 
and worse than both knowing all this as i have now 
known it many weeks guess what i must have felt on seeing 
your sister as fond of him as ever and on being assured 
that she was to marry him guess what i must have felt 
for all your sakes when i came to you last week and 
found you alone i came determined to know the truth 
though irresolute what to do when it was known 
my behaviour must have seemed strange to you then 
but now you will comprehend it to suffer you all to be 
so deceived to see your sister but what could i do 
i had no hope of interfering with success and sometimes 
i thought your sister s influence might yet reclaim him 
but now after such dishonorable usage who can tell what 
were his designs on her whatever they may have been 
however she may now and hereafter doubtless will 
turn with gratitude towards her own condition when she 
compares it with that of my poor eliza when she considers 
the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl 
and pictures her to herself with an affection for him so strong 
still as strong as her own and with a mind tormented 
by self reproach which must attend her through life 
surely this comparison must have its use with her 
she will feel her own sufferings to be nothing they 
proceed from no misconduct and can bring no disgrace 
on the contrary every friend must be made still more 
her friend by them concern for her unhappiness 
and respect for her fortitude under it must strengthen 
every attachment use your own discretion however 
in communicating to her what i have told you you must 
know best what will be its effect but had i not seriously 
and from my heart believed it might be of service 
might lessen her regrets i would not have suffered 
myself to trouble you with this account of my family 
afflictions with a recital which may seem to have been 
intended to raise myself at the expense of others 
elinor s thanks followed this speech with grateful 
earnestness attended too with the assurance of her 
expecting material advantage to marianne from the 
communication of what had passed 
i have been more pained said she by her 
endeavors to acquit him than by all the rest for it 
irritates her mind more than the most perfect conviction 
of his unworthiness can do now though at first she 
will suffer much i am sure she will soon become easier 
have you she continued after a short silence 
ever seen mr willoughby since you left him at barton 
yes he replied gravely once i have one meeting 
was unavoidable 
elinor startled by his manner looked at him anxiously 
saying 
what have you met him to 
i could meet him no other way eliza had confessed 
to me though most reluctantly the name of her lover 
and when he returned to town which was within a fortnight 
after myself we met by appointment he to defend 
i to punish his conduct we returned unwounded 
and the meeting therefore never got abroad 
elinor sighed over the fancied necessity of this 
but to a man and a soldier she presumed not to censure it 
such said colonel brandon after a pause 
has been the unhappy resemblance between the fate of mother 
and daughter and so imperfectly have i discharged my trust 
is she still in town 
no as soon as she recovered from her lying in 
for i found her near her delivery i removed her and her 
child into the country and there she remains 
recollecting soon afterwards that he was probably 
dividing elinor from her sister he put an end to his visit 
receiving from her again the same grateful acknowledgments 
and leaving her full of compassion and esteem for him 
chapter 
when the particulars of this conversation were repeated 
by miss dashwood to her sister as they very soon were 
the effect on her was not entirely such as the former 
had hoped to see not that marianne appeared to distrust 
the truth of any part of it for she listened to it all 
with the most steady and submissive attention made neither 
objection nor remark attempted no vindication of willoughby 
and seemed to shew by her tears that she felt it to 
be impossible but though this behaviour assured elinor 
that the conviction of this guilt was carried home to 
her mind though she saw with satisfaction the effect of it 
in her no longer avoiding colonel brandon when he called 
in her speaking to him even voluntarily speaking 
with a kind of compassionate respect and though she 
saw her spirits less violently irritated than before 
she did not see her less wretched her mind did become 
settled but it was settled in a gloomy dejection 
she felt the loss of willoughby s character yet more heavily 
than she had felt the loss of his heart his seduction and 
desertion of miss williams the misery of that poor girl 
and the doubt of what his designs might once have been 
on herself preyed altogether so much on her spirits 
that she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt 
even to elinor and brooding over her sorrows in silence 
gave more pain to her sister than could have been communicated 
by the most open and most frequent confession of them 
to give the feelings or the language of mrs dashwood 
on receiving and answering elinor s letter would be only 
to give a repetition of what her daughters had already felt 
and said of a disappointment hardly less painful than 
marianne s and an indignation even greater than elinor s 
long letters from her quickly succeeding each other 
arrived to tell all that she suffered and thought 
to express her anxious solicitude for marianne and entreat 
she would bear up with fortitude under this misfortune 
bad indeed must the nature of marianne s affliction be 
when her mother could talk of fortitude mortifying 
and humiliating must be the origin of those regrets 
which she could wish her not to indulge 
against the interest of her own individual comfort 
mrs dashwood had determined that it would be better for 
marianne to be any where at that time than at barton 
where every thing within her view would be bringing back 
the past in the strongest and most afflicting manner 
by constantly placing willoughby before her such as 
she had always seen him there she recommended it to 
her daughters therefore by all means not to shorten their 
visit to mrs jennings the length of which though never 
exactly fixed had been expected by all to comprise at least 
five or six weeks a variety of occupations of objects 
and of company which could not be procured at barton 
would be inevitable there and might yet she hoped 
cheat marianne at times into some interest beyond herself 
and even into some amusement much as the ideas of both 
might now be spurned by her 
from all danger of seeing willoughby again 
her mother considered her to be at least equally safe 
in town as in the country since his acquaintance must 
now be dropped by all who called themselves her friends 
design could never bring them in each other s way 
negligence could never leave them exposed to a surprise 
and chance had less in its favour in the crowd of london 
than even in the retirement of barton where it might 
force him before her while paying that visit at allenham 
on his marriage which mrs dashwood from foreseeing at 
first as a probable event had brought herself to expect 
as a certain one 
she had yet another reason for wishing her children 
to remain where they were a letter from her son in law 
had told her that he and his wife were to be in town 
before the middle of february and she judged it right 
that they should sometimes see their brother 
marianne had promised to be guided by her mother s opinion 
and she submitted to it therefore without opposition 
though it proved perfectly different from what she wished 
and expected though she felt it to be entirely wrong 
formed on mistaken grounds and that by requiring her 
longer continuance in london it deprived her of the only 
possible alleviation of her wretchedness the personal 
sympathy of her mother and doomed her to such society and 
such scenes as must prevent her ever knowing a moment s rest 
but it was a matter of great consolation to her 
that what brought evil to herself would bring good to 
her sister and elinor on the other hand suspecting that 
it would not be in her power to avoid edward entirely 
comforted herself by thinking that though their longer 
stay would therefore militate against her own happiness 
it would be better for marianne than an immediate return 
into devonshire 
her carefulness in guarding her sister from ever 
hearing willoughby s name mentioned was not thrown away 
marianne though without knowing it herself reaped all 
its advantage for neither mrs jennings nor sir john 
nor even mrs palmer herself ever spoke of him before her 
elinor wished that the same forbearance could have extended 
towards herself but that was impossible and she was 
obliged to listen day after day to the indignation of them all 
sir john could not have thought it possible 
a man of whom he had always had such reason to think well 
such a good natured fellow he did not believe there was a 
bolder rider in england it was an unaccountable business 
he wished him at the devil with all his heart he would 
not speak another word to him meet him where he might 
for all the world no not if it were to be by the side 
of barton covert and they were kept watching for two 
hours together such a scoundrel of a fellow such 
a deceitful dog it was only the last time they met 
that he had offered him one of folly s puppies and this 
was the end of it 
mrs palmer in her way was equally angry 
she was determined to drop his acquaintance immediately 
and she was very thankful that she had never been acquainted 
with him at all she wished with all her heart combe 
magna was not so near cleveland but it did not signify 
for it was a great deal too far off to visit she hated 
him so much that she was resolved never to mention 
his name again and she should tell everybody she saw 
how good for nothing he was 
the rest of mrs palmer s sympathy was shewn in procuring 
all the particulars in her power of the approaching marriage 
and communicating them to elinor she could soon tell 
at what coachmaker s the new carriage was building 
by what painter mr willoughby s portrait was drawn 
and at what warehouse miss grey s clothes might be seen 
the calm and polite unconcern of lady middleton 
on the occasion was a happy relief to elinor s spirits 
oppressed as they often were by the clamorous kindness 
of the others it was a great comfort to her to be sure 
of exciting no interest in one person at least among their 
circle of friends a great comfort to know that there 
was one who would meet her without feeling any curiosity 
after particulars or any anxiety for her sister s health 
every qualification is raised at times by the 
circumstances of the moment to more than its real value 
and she was sometimes worried down by officious condolence 
to rate good breeding as more indispensable to comfort 
than good nature 
lady middleton expressed her sense of the affair 
about once every day or twice if the subject occurred 
very often by saying it is very shocking indeed 
and by the means of this continual though gentle vent 
was able not only to see the miss dashwoods from the 
first without the smallest emotion but very soon 
to see them without recollecting a word of the matter 
and having thus supported the dignity of her own sex 
and spoken her decided censure of what was wrong 
in the other she thought herself at liberty to attend 
to the interest of her own assemblies and therefore 
determined though rather against the opinion of sir john 
that as mrs willoughby would at once be a woman of elegance 
and fortune to leave her card with her as soon as she married 
colonel brandon s delicate unobtrusive enquiries 
were never unwelcome to miss dashwood he had abundantly 
earned the privilege of intimate discussion of her 
sister s disappointment by the friendly zeal with 
which he had endeavoured to soften it and they always 
conversed with confidence his chief reward for the 
painful exertion of disclosing past sorrows and present 
humiliations was given in the pitying eye with which 
marianne sometimes observed him and the gentleness 
of her voice whenever though it did not often happen 
she was obliged or could oblige herself to speak to him 
these assured him that his exertion had produced an 
increase of good will towards himself and these gave 
elinor hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter 
but mrs jennings who knew nothing of all this who knew 
only that the colonel continued as grave as ever and that 
she could neither prevail on him to make the offer himself 
nor commission her to make it for him began at the 
end of two days to think that instead of midsummer 
they would not be married till michaelmas and by the 
end of a week that it would not be a match at all 
the good understanding between the colonel and miss 
dashwood seemed rather to declare that the honours 
of the mulberry tree the canal and the yew arbour 
would all be made over to her and mrs jennings had 
for some time ceased to think at all of mrs ferrars 
early in february within a fortnight from the 
receipt of willoughby s letter elinor had the painful 
office of informing her sister that he was married 
she had taken care to have the intelligence conveyed 
to herself as soon as it was known that the ceremony 
was over as she was desirous that marianne should not 
receive the first notice of it from the public papers 
which she saw her eagerly examining every morning 
she received the news with resolute composure 
made no observation on it and at first she would no tears 
but after a short time they would burst out and for the 
rest of the day she was in a state hardly less pitiable 
than when she first learnt to expect the event 
the willoughbys left town as soon as they were married 
and elinor now hoped as there could be no danger 
of her seeing either of them to prevail on her sister 
who had never yet left the house since the blow first fell 
to go out again by degrees as she had done before 
about this time the two miss steeles lately arrived 
at their cousin s house in bartlett s buildings 
holburn presented themselves again before their more 
grand relations in conduit and berkeley streets 
and were welcomed by them all with great cordiality 
elinor only was sorry to see them their presence 
always gave her pain and she hardly knew how to make 
a very gracious return to the overpowering delight of lucy 
in finding her still in town 
i should have been quite disappointed if i had not 
found you here still said she repeatedly with a strong 
emphasis on the word but i always thought i should 
i was almost sure you would not leave london yet awhile 
though you told me you know at barton that you should 
not stay above a month but i thought at the time 
that you would most likely change your mind when it came 
to the point it would have been such a great pity 
to have went away before your brother and sister came 
and now to be sure you will be in no hurry to be gone 
i am amazingly glad you did not keep to your word 
elinor perfectly understood her and was forced 
to use all her self command to make it appear that she 
did not 
well my dear said mrs jennings and how did 
you travel 
not in the stage i assure you replied miss steele 
with quick exultation we came post all the way and had 
a very smart beau to attend us dr davies was coming 
to town and so we thought we would join him in a post chaise 
and he behaved very genteelly and paid ten or twelve 
shillings more than we did 
oh oh cried mrs jennings very pretty 
indeed and the doctor is a single man i warrant you 
there now said miss steele affectedly simpering 
everybody laughs at me so about the doctor and i 
cannot think why my cousins say they are sure i have 
made a conquest but for my part i declare i never think 
about him from one hour s end to another lord here 
comes your beau nancy my cousin said t other day 
when she saw him crossing the street to the house 
my beau indeed said i i cannot think who you mean 
the doctor is no beau of mine 
aye aye that is very pretty talking but it will not do 
the doctor is the man i see 
no indeed replied her cousin with affected earnestness 
and i beg you will contradict it if you ever hear it talked 
of 
mrs jennings directly gave her the gratifying 
assurance that she certainly would not and miss steele 
was made completely happy 
i suppose you will go and stay with your brother 
and sister miss dashwood when they come to town 
said lucy returning after a cessation of hostile hints 
to the charge 
no i do not think we shall 
oh yes i dare say you will 
elinor would not humour her by farther opposition 
what a charming thing it is that mrs dashwood can 
spare you both for so long a time together 
long a time indeed interposed mrs jennings 
why their visit is but just begun 
lucy was silenced 
i am sorry we cannot see your sister miss dashwood 
said miss steele i am sorry she is not well 
for marianne had left the room on their arrival 
you are very good my sister will be equally 
sorry to miss the pleasure of seeing you but she has 
been very much plagued lately with nervous head aches 
which make her unfit for company or conversation 
oh dear that is a great pity but such old 
friends as lucy and me i think she might see us 
and i am sure we would not speak a word 
elinor with great civility declined the proposal 
her sister was perhaps laid down upon the bed or in her 
dressing gown and therefore not able to come to them 
oh if that is all cried miss steele we can 
just as well go and see her 
elinor began to find this impertinence too much for 
her temper but she was saved the trouble of checking it 
by lucy s sharp reprimand which now as on many occasions 
though it did not give much sweetness to the manners 
of one sister was of advantage in governing those of 
the other 
chapter 
after some opposition marianne yielded to her 
sister s entreaties and consented to go out with her 
and mrs jennings one morning for half an hour she 
expressly conditioned however for paying no visits 
and would do no more than accompany them to gray s in 
sackville street where elinor was carrying on a negotiation 
for the exchange of a few old fashioned jewels of her mother 
when they stopped at the door mrs jennings recollected 
that there was a lady at the other end of the street 
on whom she ought to call and as she had no business 
at gray s it was resolved that while her young friends 
transacted their s she should pay her visit and 
return for them 
on ascending the stairs the miss dashwoods found 
so many people before them in the room that there was 
not a person at liberty to tend to their orders and they 
were obliged to wait all that could be done was to sit 
down at that end of the counter which seemed to promise the 
quickest succession one gentleman only was standing there 
and it is probable that elinor was not without hope 
of exciting his politeness to a quicker despatch 
but the correctness of his eye and the delicacy 
of his taste proved to be beyond his politeness 
he was giving orders for a toothpick case for himself 
and till its size shape and ornaments were determined 
all of which after examining and debating for a quarter 
of an hour over every toothpick case in the shop 
were finally arranged by his own inventive fancy he had 
no leisure to bestow any other attention on the two ladies 
than what was comprised in three or four very broad stares 
a kind of notice which served to imprint on elinor 
the remembrance of a person and face of strong 
natural sterling insignificance though adorned in 
the first style of fashion 
marianne was spared from the troublesome feelings 
of contempt and resentment on this impertinent examination 
of their features and on the puppyism of his manner 
in deciding on all the different horrors of the different 
toothpick cases presented to his inspection by remaining 
unconscious of it all for she was as well able to collect 
her thoughts within herself and be as ignorant of what was 
passing around her in mr gray s shop as in her own bedroom 
at last the affair was decided the ivory 
the gold and the pearls all received their appointment 
and the gentleman having named the last day on which his 
existence could be continued without the possession of the 
toothpick case drew on his gloves with leisurely care 
and bestowing another glance on the miss dashwoods but such 
a one as seemed rather to demand than express admiration 
walked off with a happy air of real conceit and affected 
indifference 
elinor lost no time in bringing her business forward 
was on the point of concluding it when another gentleman 
presented himself at her side she turned her eyes towards 
his face and found him with some surprise to be her brother 
their affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough 
to make a very creditable appearance in mr gray s shop 
john dashwood was really far from being sorry to see 
his sisters again it rather gave them satisfaction 
and his inquiries after their mother were respectful 
and attentive 
elinor found that he and fanny had been in town 
two days 
i wished very much to call upon you yesterday 
said he but it was impossible for we were obliged 
to take harry to see the wild beasts at exeter exchange 
and we spent the rest of the day with mrs ferrars 
harry was vastly pleased this morning i had fully intended 
to call on you if i could possibly find a spare half hour 
but one has always so much to do on first coming to town 
i am come here to bespeak fanny a seal but tomorrow i 
think i shall certainly be able to call in berkeley street 
and be introduced to your friend mrs jennings 
i understand she is a woman of very good fortune 
and the middletons too you must introduce me to them 
as my mother in law s relations i shall be happy to show 
them every respect they are excellent neighbours to you in 
the country i understand 
excellent indeed their attention to our comfort 
their friendliness in every particular is more than i 
can express 
i am extremely glad to hear it upon my word 
extremely glad indeed but so it ought to be they are 
people of large fortune they are related to you and 
every civility and accommodation that can serve to make 
your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected 
and so you are most comfortably settled in your little cottage 
and want for nothing edward brought us a most charming 
account of the place the most complete thing of its kind 
he said that ever was and you all seemed to enjoy it beyond 
any thing it was a great satisfaction to us to hear it 
i assure you 
elinor did feel a little ashamed of her brother 
and was not sorry to be spared the necessity of answering him 
by the arrival of mrs jennings s servant who came to tell 
her that his mistress waited for them at the door 
mr dashwood attended them down stairs was introduced 
to mrs jennings at the door of her carriage and repeating 
his hope of being able to call on them the next day 
took leave 
his visit was duly paid he came with a pretence at 
an apology from their sister in law for not coming too 
but she was so much engaged with her mother that really 
she had no leisure for going any where mrs jennings 
however assured him directly that she should not stand 
upon ceremony for they were all cousins or something 
like it and she should certainly wait on mrs john 
dashwood very soon and bring her sisters to see her 
his manners to them though calm were perfectly kind 
to mrs jennings most attentively civil and on colonel 
brandon s coming in soon after himself he eyed him with a 
curiosity which seemed to say that he only wanted to know 
him to be rich to be equally civil to him 
after staying with them half an hour he asked 
elinor to walk with him to conduit street and introduce 
him to sir john and lady middleton the weather was 
remarkably fine and she readily consented as soon 
as they were out of the house his enquiries began 
who is colonel brandon is he a man of fortune 
yes he has very good property in dorsetshire 
i am glad of it he seems a most gentlemanlike man 
and i think elinor i may congratulate you on the prospect 
of a very respectable establishment in life 
me brother what do you mean 
he likes you i observed him narrowly and am 
convinced of it what is the amount of his fortune 
i believe about two thousand a year 
two thousand a year and then working himself 
up to a pitch of enthusiastic generosity he added 
elinor i wish with all my heart it were twice as much 
for your sake 
indeed i believe you replied elinor but i am 
very sure that colonel brandon has not the smallest wish 
of marrying me 
you are mistaken elinor you are very much mistaken 
a very little trouble on your side secures him 
perhaps just at present he may be undecided the smallness 
of your fortune may make him hang back his friends 
may all advise him against it but some of those little 
attentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily 
give will fix him in spite of himself and there can be 
no reason why you should not try for him it is not to be 
supposed that any prior attachment on your side in short 
you know as to an attachment of that kind it is quite 
out of the question the objections are insurmountable 
you have too much sense not to see all that colonel brandon 
must be the man and no civility shall be wanting on 
my part to make him pleased with you and your family 
it is a match that must give universal satisfaction 
in short it is a kind of thing that lowering his voice 
to an important whisper will be exceedingly welcome 
to all parties recollecting himself however he added 
that is i mean to say your friends are all truly 
anxious to see you well settled fanny particularly 
for she has your interest very much at heart i assure you 
and her mother too mrs ferrars a very good natured woman 
i am sure it would give her great pleasure she said as much 
the other day 
elinor would not vouchsafe any answer 
it would be something remarkable now he continued 
something droll if fanny should have a brother and i 
a sister settling at the same time and yet it is not 
very unlikely 
is mr edward ferrars said elinor with resolution 
going to be married 
it is not actually settled but there is such 
a thing in agitation he has a most excellent mother 
mrs ferrars with the utmost liberality will come forward 
and settle on him a thousand a year if the match 
takes place the lady is the hon miss morton only daughter 
of the late lord morton with thirty thousand pounds 
a very desirable connection on both sides and i have not 
a doubt of its taking place in time a thousand a year 
is a great deal for a mother to give away to make over 
for ever but mrs ferrars has a noble spirit to give 
you another instance of her liberality the other day 
as soon as we came to town aware that money could 
not be very plenty with us just now she put bank notes 
into fanny s hands to the amount of two hundred pounds 
and extremely acceptable it is for we must live at a great 
expense while we are here 
he paused for her assent and compassion and she 
forced herself to say 
your expenses both in town and country must certainly 
be considerable but your income is a large one 
not so large i dare say as many people suppose 
i do not mean to complain however it is undoubtedly 
a comfortable one and i hope will in time be better 
the enclosure of norland common now carrying on 
is a most serious drain and then i have made a little 
purchase within this half year east kingham farm 
you must remember the place where old gibson used to live 
the land was so very desirable for me in every respect 
so immediately adjoining my own property that i felt it 
my duty to buy it i could not have answered it to my 
conscience to let it fall into any other hands a man must 
pay for his convenience and it has cost me a vast deal 
of money 
more than you think it really and intrinsically worth 
why i hope not that i might have sold it again 
the next day for more than i gave but with regard to the 
purchase money i might have been very unfortunate indeed 
for the stocks were at that time so low that if i had not 
happened to have the necessary sum in my banker s hands 
i must have sold out to very great loss 
elinor could only smile 
other great and inevitable expenses too we have 
had on first coming to norland our respected father 
as you well know bequeathed all the stanhill effects 
that remained at norland and very valuable they were 
to your mother far be it from me to repine at his 
doing so he had an undoubted right to dispose of his 
own property as he chose but in consequence of it 
we have been obliged to make large purchases of linen 
china c to supply the place of what was taken away 
you may guess after all these expenses how very far we 
must be from being rich and how acceptable mrs ferrars s 
kindness is 
certainly said elinor and assisted by her liberality 
i hope you may yet live to be in easy circumstances 
another year or two may do much towards it 
he gravely replied but however there is still a great 
deal to be done there is not a stone laid of fanny s 
green house and nothing but the plan of the flower garden 
marked out 
where is the green house to be 
upon the knoll behind the house the old 
walnut trees are all come down to make room for it 
it will be a very fine object from many parts of the park 
and the flower garden will slope down just before it 
and be exceedingly pretty we have cleared away all the old 
thorns that grew in patches over the brow 
elinor kept her concern and her censure to herself 
and was very thankful that marianne was not present 
to share the provocation 
having now said enough to make his poverty clear 
and to do away the necessity of buying a pair of ear rings 
for each of his sisters in his next visit at gray s 
his thoughts took a cheerfuller turn and he began to 
congratulate elinor on having such a friend as mrs jennings 
she seems a most valuable woman indeed her house 
her style of living all bespeak an exceeding good income 
and it is an acquaintance that has not only been 
of great use to you hitherto but in the end may prove 
materially advantageous her inviting you to town is 
certainly a vast thing in your favour and indeed it 
speaks altogether so great a regard for you that in all 
probability when she dies you will not be forgotten 
she must have a great deal to leave 
nothing at all i should rather suppose for she has 
only her jointure which will descend to her children 
but it is not to be imagined that she lives up to 
her income few people of common prudence will do that 
and whatever she saves she will be able to dispose of 
and do you not think it more likely that she 
should leave it to her daughters than to us 
her daughters are both exceedingly well married 
and therefore i cannot perceive the necessity of her 
remembering them farther whereas in my opinion by her 
taking so much notice of you and treating you in this 
kind of way she has given you a sort of claim on her 
future consideration which a conscientious woman would 
not disregard nothing can be kinder than her behaviour 
and she can hardly do all this without being aware 
of the expectation it raises 
but she raises none in those most concerned 
indeed brother your anxiety for our welfare and prosperity 
carries you too far 
why to be sure said he seeming to recollect himself 
people have little have very little in their power 
but my dear elinor what is the matter with marianne 
she looks very unwell has lost her colour and is grown 
quite thin is she ill 
she is not well she has had a nervous complaint 
on her for several weeks 
i am sorry for that at her time of life 
any thing of an illness destroys the bloom for ever 
her s has been a very short one she was as handsome a girl 
last september as i ever saw and as likely to attract 
the man there was something in her style of beauty 
to please them particularly i remember fanny used to say 
that she would marry sooner and better than you did 
not but what she is exceedingly fond of you but so it 
happened to strike her she will be mistaken however 
i question whether marianne now will marry a man worth 
more than five or six hundred a year at the utmost 
and i am very much deceived if you do not do better 
dorsetshire i know very little of dorsetshire but my dear 
elinor i shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it 
and i think i can answer for your having fanny and myself 
among the earliest and best pleased of your visitors 
elinor tried very seriously to convince him that 
there was no likelihood of her marrying colonel brandon 
but it was an expectation of too much pleasure to himself 
to be relinquished and he was really resolved on seeking 
an intimacy with that gentleman and promoting the marriage 
by every possible attention he had just compunction 
enough for having done nothing for his sisters himself 
to be exceedingly anxious that everybody else should 
do a great deal and an offer from colonel brandon 
or a legacy from mrs jennings was the easiest means 
of atoning for his own neglect 
they were lucky enough to find lady middleton 
at home and sir john came in before their visit ended 
abundance of civilities passed on all sides sir john 
was ready to like anybody and though mr dashwood did 
not seem to know much about horses he soon set him 
down as a very good natured fellow while lady middleton 
saw enough of fashion in his appearance to think his 
acquaintance worth having and mr dashwood went away 
delighted with both 
i shall have a charming account to carry 
to fanny said he as he walked back with his sister 
lady middleton is really a most elegant woman such 
a woman as i am sure fanny will be glad to know 
and mrs jennings too an exceedingly well behaved woman 
though not so elegant as her daughter your sister need 
not have any scruple even of visiting her which to say 
the truth has been a little the case and very naturally 
for we only knew that mrs jennings was the widow of a man 
who had got all his money in a low way and fanny and 
mrs ferrars were both strongly prepossessed that neither 
she nor her daughters were such kind of women as fanny 
would like to associate with but now i can carry her 
a most satisfactory account of both 
chapter 
mrs john dashwood had so much confidence in her 
husband s judgment that she waited the very next day 
both on mrs jennings and her daughter and her 
confidence was rewarded by finding even the former 
even the woman with whom her sisters were staying 
by no means unworthy her notice and as for lady middleton 
she found her one of the most charming women in the world 
lady middleton was equally pleased with mrs dashwood 
there was a kind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides 
which mutually attracted them and they sympathised 
with each other in an insipid propriety of demeanor 
and a general want of understanding 
the same manners however which recommended mrs john 
dashwood to the good opinion of lady middleton did not suit 
the fancy of mrs jennings and to her she appeared nothing 
more than a little proud looking woman of uncordial address 
who met her husband s sisters without any affection 
and almost without having anything to say to them 
for of the quarter of an hour bestowed on berkeley street 
she sat at least seven minutes and a half in silence 
elinor wanted very much to know though she did 
not chuse to ask whether edward was then in town 
but nothing would have induced fanny voluntarily 
to mention his name before her till able to tell her 
that his marriage with miss morton was resolved on 
or till her husband s expectations on colonel brandon 
were answered because she believed them still so very 
much attached to each other that they could not be too 
sedulously divided in word and deed on every occasion 
the intelligence however which she would not give 
soon flowed from another quarter lucy came very shortly 
to claim elinor s compassion on being unable to see edward 
though he had arrived in town with mr and mrs dashwood 
he dared not come to bartlett s buildings for fear 
of detection and though their mutual impatience to meet 
was not to be told they could do nothing at present 
but write 
edward assured them himself of his being in town 
within a very short time by twice calling in berkeley street 
twice was his card found on the table when they returned 
from their morning s engagements elinor was pleased 
that he had called and still more pleased that she had 
missed him 
the dashwoods were so prodigiously delighted 
with the middletons that though not much in the habit 
of giving anything they determined to give them 
a dinner and soon after their acquaintance began 
invited them to dine in harley street where they had 
taken a very good house for three months their sisters 
and mrs jennings were invited likewise and john dashwood 
was careful to secure colonel brandon who always glad 
to be where the miss dashwoods were received his eager 
civilities with some surprise but much more pleasure 
they were to meet mrs ferrars but elinor could not learn 
whether her sons were to be of the party the expectation 
of seeing her however was enough to make her interested 
in the engagement for though she could now meet edward s 
mother without that strong anxiety which had once promised 
to attend such an introduction though she could now see 
her with perfect indifference as to her opinion of herself 
her desire of being in company with mrs ferrars 
her curiosity to know what she was like was as lively as ever 
the interest with which she thus anticipated the 
party was soon afterwards increased more powerfully 
than pleasantly by her hearing that the miss steeles 
were also to be at it 
so well had they recommended themselves to lady middleton 
so agreeable had their assiduities made them to her 
that though lucy was certainly not so elegant and her 
sister not even genteel she was as ready as sir john 
to ask them to spend a week or two in conduit street 
and it happened to be particularly convenient to the miss 
steeles as soon as the dashwoods invitation was known 
that their visit should begin a few days before the party 
took place 
their claims to the notice of mrs john dashwood 
as the nieces of the gentleman who for many years had 
had the care of her brother might not have done much 
however towards procuring them seats at her table 
but as lady middleton s guests they must be welcome and lucy 
who had long wanted to be personally known to the family 
to have a nearer view of their characters and her own 
difficulties and to have an opportunity of endeavouring 
to please them had seldom been happier in her life 
than she was on receiving mrs john dashwood s card 
on elinor its effect was very different she began 
immediately to determine that edward who lived with 
his mother must be asked as his mother was to a party 
given by his sister and to see him for the first time 
after all that passed in the company of lucy she hardly 
knew how she could bear it 
these apprehensions perhaps were not founded 
entirely on reason and certainly not at all on truth 
they were relieved however not by her own recollection 
but by the good will of lucy who believed herself to be 
inflicting a severe disappointment when she told her 
that edward certainly would not be in harley street on tuesday 
and even hoped to be carrying the pain still farther 
by persuading her that he was kept away by the extreme 
affection for herself which he could not conceal when they 
were together 
the important tuesday came that was to introduce 
the two young ladies to this formidable mother in law 
pity me dear miss dashwood said lucy as they 
walked up the stairs together for the middletons arrived 
so directly after mrs jennings that they all followed 
the servant at the same time there is nobody here but 
you that can feel for me i declare i can hardly stand 
good gracious in a moment i shall see the person that all 
my happiness depends on that is to be my mother 
elinor could have given her immediate relief 
by suggesting the possibility of its being miss morton s mother 
rather than her own whom they were about to behold 
but instead of doing that she assured her and with 
great sincerity that she did pity her to the utter 
amazement of lucy who though really uncomfortable herself 
hoped at least to be an object of irrepressible envy to elinor 
mrs ferrars was a little thin woman upright 
even to formality in her figure and serious 
even to sourness in her aspect her complexion was sallow 
and her features small without beauty and naturally 
without expression but a lucky contraction of the brow 
had rescued her countenance from the disgrace of insipidity 
by giving it the strong characters of pride and ill nature 
she was not a woman of many words for unlike people 
in general she proportioned them to the number of 
her ideas and of the few syllables that did escape her 
not one fell to the share of miss dashwood whom she eyed 
with the spirited determination of disliking her at all events 
elinor could not now be made unhappy by this behaviour 
a few months ago it would have hurt her exceedingly but it 
was not in mrs ferrars power to distress her by it now 
and the difference of her manners to the miss steeles 
a difference which seemed purposely made to humble her more 
only amused her she could not but smile to see the graciousness 
of both mother and daughter towards the very person 
for lucy was particularly distinguished whom of all others 
had they known as much as she did they would have been most 
anxious to mortify while she herself who had comparatively 
no power to wound them sat pointedly slighted by both 
but while she smiled at a graciousness so misapplied 
she could not reflect on the mean spirited folly from 
which it sprung nor observe the studied attentions 
with which the miss steeles courted its continuance 
without thoroughly despising them all four 
lucy was all exultation on being so honorably 
distinguished and miss steele wanted only to be teazed 
about dr davies to be perfectly happy 
the dinner was a grand one the servants were numerous 
and every thing bespoke the mistress s inclination 
for show and the master s ability to support it 
in spite of the improvements and additions which were 
making to the norland estate and in spite of its owner 
having once been within some thousand pounds of being 
obliged to sell out at a loss nothing gave any symptom 
of that indigence which he had tried to infer from it 
no poverty of any kind except of conversation appeared 
but there the deficiency was considerable john dashwood 
had not much to say for himself that was worth hearing 
and his wife had still less but there was no peculiar 
disgrace in this for it was very much the case with 
the chief of their visitors who almost all laboured 
under one or other of these disqualifications for being 
agreeable want of sense either natural or improved want 
of elegance want of spirits or want of temper 
when the ladies withdrew to the drawing room 
after dinner this poverty was particularly evident 
for the gentlemen had supplied the discourse with some 
variety the variety of politics inclosing land 
and breaking horses but then it was all over and one 
subject only engaged the ladies till coffee came in 
which was the comparative heights of harry dashwood 
and lady middleton s second son william who were nearly 
of the same age 
had both the children been there the affair might 
have been determined too easily by measuring them at once 
but as harry only was present it was all conjectural 
assertion on both sides and every body had a right to 
be equally positive in their opinion and to repeat it 
over and over again as often as they liked 
the parties stood thus 
the two mothers though each really convinced that 
her own son was the tallest politely decided in favour 
of the other 
the two grandmothers with not less partiality 
but more sincerity were equally earnest in support 
of their own descendant 
lucy who was hardly less anxious to please one parent 
than the other thought the boys were both remarkably tall 
for their age and could not conceive that there could 
be the smallest difference in the world between them 
and miss steele with yet greater address gave it 
as fast as she could in favour of each 
elinor having once delivered her opinion on 
william s side by which she offended mrs ferrars and 
fanny still more did not see the necessity of enforcing 
it by any farther assertion and marianne when called 
on for her s offended them all by declaring that she 
had no opinion to give as she had never thought about it 
before her removing from norland elinor had painted 
a very pretty pair of screens for her sister in law 
which being now just mounted and brought home 
ornamented her present drawing room and these screens 
catching the eye of john dashwood on his following 
the other gentlemen into the room were officiously 
handed by him to colonel brandon for his admiration 
these are done by my eldest sister said he and you 
as a man of taste will i dare say be pleased with them 
i do not know whether you have ever happened to see any 
of her performances before but she is in general reckoned 
to draw extremely well 
the colonel though disclaiming all pretensions 
to connoisseurship warmly admired the screens as he 
would have done any thing painted by miss dashwood 
and on the curiosity of the others being of course excited 
they were handed round for general inspection 
mrs ferrars not aware of their being elinor s work 
particularly requested to look at them and after they had 
received gratifying testimony of lady middletons s approbation 
fanny presented them to her mother considerately informing 
her at the same time that they were done by miss dashwood 
hum said mrs ferrars very pretty and without 
regarding them at all returned them to her daughter 
perhaps fanny thought for a moment that her mother 
had been quite rude enough for colouring a little 
she immediately said 
they are very pretty madam an t they but then again 
the dread of having been too civil too encouraging herself 
probably came over her for she presently added 
do you not think they are something in miss 
morton s style of painting madam she does paint most 
delightfully how beautifully her last landscape is done 
beautifully indeed but she does every thing well 
marianne could not bear this she was already 
greatly displeased with mrs ferrars and such ill timed 
praise of another at elinor s expense though she 
had not any notion of what was principally meant by it 
provoked her immediately to say with warmth 
this is admiration of a very particular kind 
what is miss morton to us who knows or who cares 
for her it is elinor of whom we think and speak 
and so saying she took the screens out of her 
sister in law s hands to admire them herself as they 
ought to be admired 
mrs ferrars looked exceedingly angry and drawing 
herself up more stiffly than ever pronounced in retort 
this bitter philippic miss morton is lord morton s daughter 
fanny looked very angry too and her husband was 
all in a fright at his sister s audacity elinor was 
much more hurt by marianne s warmth than she had been 
by what produced it but colonel brandon s eyes as they 
were fixed on marianne declared that he noticed only 
what was amiable in it the affectionate heart which could 
not bear to see a sister slighted in the smallest point 
marianne s feelings did not stop here the cold 
insolence of mrs ferrars s general behaviour to her sister 
seemed to her to foretell such difficulties and distresses 
to elinor as her own wounded heart taught her to think 
of with horror and urged by a strong impulse of 
affectionate sensibility she moved after a moment 
to her sister s chair and putting one arm round her neck 
and one cheek close to hers said in a low but eager 
voice 
dear dear elinor do not mind them do not let them 
make you unhappy 
she could say no more her spirits were quite overcome 
and hiding her face on elinor s shoulder she burst 
into tears every body s attention was called and almost 
every body was concerned colonel brandon rose up and went 
to them without knowing what he did mrs jennings 
with a very intelligent ah poor dear immediately gave 
her her salts and sir john felt so desperately enraged 
against the author of this nervous distress that he 
instantly changed his seat to one close by lucy steele 
and gave her in a whisper a brief account of the whole 
shocking affair 
in a few minutes however marianne was recovered 
enough to put an end to the bustle and sit down among 
the rest though her spirits retained the impression 
of what had passed the whole evening 
poor marianne said her brother to colonel brandon 
in a low voice as soon as he could secure his attention 
she has not such good health as her sister she is very 
nervous she has not elinor s constitution and one must 
allow that there is something very trying to a young woman 
who has been a beauty in the loss of her personal attractions 
you would not think it perhaps but marianne was remarkably 
handsome a few months ago quite as handsome as elinor 
now you see it is all gone 
chapter 
elinor s curiosity to see mrs ferrars was satisfied 
she had found in her every thing that could tend to make 
a farther connection between the families undesirable 
she had seen enough of her pride her meanness and her 
determined prejudice against herself to comprehend all 
the difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement 
and retarded the marriage of edward and herself had he been 
otherwise free and she had seen almost enough to be thankful 
for her own sake that one greater obstacle preserved her 
from suffering under any other of mrs ferrars s creation 
preserved her from all dependence upon her caprice or any 
solicitude for her good opinion or at least if she did not 
bring herself quite to rejoice in edward s being fettered 
to lucy she determined that had lucy been more amiable 
she ought to have rejoiced 
she wondered that lucy s spirits could be so very much 
elevated by the civility of mrs ferrars that her interest 
and her vanity should so very much blind her as to make 
the attention which seemed only paid her because she was 
not elinor appear a compliment to herself or to allow 
her to derive encouragement from a preference only given her 
because her real situation was unknown but that it was so 
had not only been declared by lucy s eyes at the time 
but was declared over again the next morning more openly 
for at her particular desire lady middleton set her down 
in berkeley street on the chance of seeing elinor alone 
to tell her how happy she was 
the chance proved a lucky one for a message from 
mrs palmer soon after she arrived carried mrs jennings away 
my dear friend cried lucy as soon as they were 
by themselves i come to talk to you of my happiness 
could anything be so flattering as mrs ferrars s way 
of treating me yesterday so exceeding affable as she 
was you know how i dreaded the thoughts of seeing her 
but the very moment i was introduced there was such an 
affability in her behaviour as really should seem to say 
she had quite took a fancy to me now was not it so 
you saw it all and was not you quite struck with it 
she was certainly very civil to you 
civil did you see nothing but only civility 
i saw a vast deal more such kindness as fell to the share 
of nobody but me no pride no hauteur and your sister 
just the same all sweetness and affability 
elinor wished to talk of something else but lucy still 
pressed her to own that she had reason for her happiness 
and elinor was obliged to go on 
undoubtedly if they had known your engagement 
said she nothing could be more flattering than their 
treatment of you but as that was not the case 
i guessed you would say so replied lucy 
quickly but there was no reason in the world why 
mrs ferrars should seem to like me if she did not 
and her liking me is every thing you shall not talk me 
out of my satisfaction i am sure it will all end well 
and there will be no difficulties at all to what i 
used to think mrs ferrars is a charming woman 
and so is your sister they are both delightful women 
indeed i wonder i should never hear you say how agreeable 
mrs dashwood was 
to this elinor had no answer to make and did not 
attempt any 
are you ill miss dashwood you seem low you 
do not speak sure you an t well 
i never was in better health 
i am glad of it with all my heart but really you did 
not look it i should be sorry to have you ill you that have 
been the greatest comfort to me in the world heaven 
knows what i should have done without your friendship 
elinor tried to make a civil answer though doubting 
her own success but it seemed to satisfy lucy for she 
directly replied 
indeed i am perfectly convinced of your regard 
for me and next to edward s love it is the greatest 
comfort i have poor edward but now there is one 
good thing we shall be able to meet and meet pretty often 
for lady middleton s delighted with mrs dashwood 
so we shall be a good deal in harley street i dare say 
and edward spends half his time with his sister besides 
lady middleton and mrs ferrars will visit now 
and mrs ferrars and your sister were both so good to say 
more than once they should always be glad to see me 
they are such charming women i am sure if ever you 
tell your sister what i think of her you cannot speak 
too high 
but elinor would not give her any encouragement 
to hope that she should tell her sister lucy continued 
i am sure i should have seen it in a moment 
if mrs ferrars had took a dislike to me if she had only 
made me a formal courtesy for instance without saying 
a word and never after had took any notice of me 
and never looked at me in a pleasant way you know 
what i mean if i had been treated in that forbidding 
sort of way i should have gave it all up in despair 
i could not have stood it for where she does dislike 
i know it is most violent 
elinor was prevented from making any reply to this 
civil triumph by the door s being thrown open the servant s 
announcing mr ferrars and edward s immediately walking in 
it was a very awkward moment and the countenance of each 
shewed that it was so they all looked exceedingly foolish 
and edward seemed to have as great an inclination to walk 
out of the room again as to advance farther into it 
the very circumstance in its unpleasantest form 
which they would each have been most anxious to avoid 
had fallen on them they were not only all three together 
but were together without the relief of any other person 
the ladies recovered themselves first it was not lucy s 
business to put herself forward and the appearance of 
secrecy must still be kept up she could therefore only 
look her tenderness and after slightly addressing him 
said no more 
but elinor had more to do and so anxious was she 
for his sake and her own to do it well that she 
forced herself after a moment s recollection 
to welcome him with a look and manner that were almost easy 
and almost open and another struggle another effort still 
improved them she would not allow the presence of lucy 
nor the consciousness of some injustice towards herself 
to deter her from saying that she was happy to see him 
and that she had very much regretted being from home 
when he called before in berkeley street she would 
not be frightened from paying him those attentions which 
as a friend and almost a relation were his due by the 
observant eyes of lucy though she soon perceived them 
to be narrowly watching her 
her manners gave some re assurance to edward and he 
had courage enough to sit down but his embarrassment still 
exceeded that of the ladies in a proportion which the case 
rendered reasonable though his sex might make it rare 
for his heart had not the indifference of lucy s nor 
could his conscience have quite the ease of elinor s 
lucy with a demure and settled air seemed determined 
to make no contribution to the comfort of the others 
and would not say a word and almost every thing that was 
said proceeded from elinor who was obliged to volunteer 
all the information about her mother s health their coming 
to town c which edward ought to have inquired about 
but never did 
her exertions did not stop here for she soon 
afterwards felt herself so heroically disposed as 
to determine under pretence of fetching marianne 
to leave the others by themselves and she really did it 
and that in the handsomest manner for she loitered away 
several minutes on the landing place with the most 
high minded fortitude before she went to her sister 
when that was once done however it was time for the raptures 
of edward to cease for marianne s joy hurried her into 
the drawing room immediately her pleasure in seeing him 
was like every other of her feelings strong in itself 
and strongly spoken she met him with a hand that would 
be taken and a voice that expressed the affection of a sister 
dear edward she cried this is a moment of great 
happiness this would almost make amends for every thing 
edward tried to return her kindness as it deserved 
but before such witnesses he dared not say half what he 
really felt again they all sat down and for a moment 
or two all were silent while marianne was looking with the 
most speaking tenderness sometimes at edward and sometimes 
at elinor regretting only that their delight in each 
other should be checked by lucy s unwelcome presence 
edward was the first to speak and it was to notice 
marianne s altered looks and express his fear of her 
not finding london agree with her 
oh do not think of me she replied with spirited 
earnestness though her eyes were filled with tears 
as she spoke do not think of my health elinor is well 
you see that must be enough for us both 
this remark was not calculated to make edward or 
elinor more easy nor to conciliate the good will of lucy 
who looked up at marianne with no very benignant expression 
do you like london said edward willing to say 
any thing that might introduce another subject 
not at all i expected much pleasure in it 
but i have found none the sight of you edward is the 
only comfort it has afforded and thank heaven you 
are what you always were 
she paused no one spoke 
i think elinor she presently added we must 
employ edward to take care of us in our return to barton 
in a week or two i suppose we shall be going and i trust 
edward will not be very unwilling to accept the charge 
poor edward muttered something but what it was 
nobody knew not even himself but marianne who saw 
his agitation and could easily trace it to whatever 
because best pleased herself was perfectly satisfied 
and soon talked of something else 
we spent such a day edward in harley street 
yesterday so dull so wretchedly dull but i have much 
to say to you on that head which cannot be said now 
and with this admirable discretion did she defer 
the assurance of her finding their mutual relatives more 
disagreeable than ever and of her being particularly 
disgusted with his mother till they were more in private 
but why were you not there edward why did you 
not come 
i was engaged elsewhere 
engaged but what was that when such friends 
were to be met 
perhaps miss marianne cried lucy eager to take 
some revenge on her you think young men never stand 
upon engagements if they have no mind to keep them 
little as well as great 
elinor was very angry but marianne seemed entirely 
insensible of the sting for she calmly replied 
not so indeed for seriously speaking i am very 
sure that conscience only kept edward from harley street 
and i really believe he has the most delicate conscience 
in the world the most scrupulous in performing 
every engagement however minute and however it 
may make against his interest or pleasure he is the 
most fearful of giving pain of wounding expectation 
and the most incapable of being selfish of any body 
i ever saw edward it is so and i will say it 
what are you never to hear yourself praised then you 
must be no friend of mine for those who will accept 
of my love and esteem must submit to my open commendation 
the nature of her commendation in the present case 
however happened to be particularly ill suited to the 
feelings of two thirds of her auditors and was so very 
unexhilarating to edward that he very soon got up to go away 
going so soon said marianne my dear edward 
this must not be 
and drawing him a little aside she whispered 
her persuasion that lucy could not stay much longer 
but even this encouragement failed for he would go 
and lucy who would have outstaid him had his visit lasted 
two hours soon afterwards went away 
what can bring her here so often said marianne 
on her leaving them could not she see that we wanted 
her gone how teazing to edward 
why so we were all his friends and lucy has been 
the longest known to him of any it is but natural 
that he should like to see her as well as ourselves 
marianne looked at her steadily and said you know 
elinor that this is a kind of talking which i cannot bear 
if you only hope to have your assertion contradicted 
as i must suppose to be the case you ought to recollect 
that i am the last person in the world to do it 
i cannot descend to be tricked out of assurances that are 
not really wanted 
she then left the room and elinor dared not follow 
her to say more for bound as she was by her promise 
of secrecy to lucy she could give no information that 
would convince marianne and painful as the consequences 
of her still continuing in an error might be she was 
obliged to submit to it all that she could hope was 
that edward would not often expose her or himself to the 
distress of hearing marianne s mistaken warmth nor to the 
repetition of any other part of the pain that had attended 
their recent meeting and this she had every reason to expect 
chapter 
within a few days after this meeting the newspapers 
announced to the world that the lady of thomas palmer 
esq was safely delivered of a son and heir a very 
interesting and satisfactory paragraph at least to all 
those intimate connections who knew it before 
this event highly important to mrs jennings s happiness 
produced a temporary alteration in the disposal of her time 
and influenced in a like degree the engagements 
of her young friends for as she wished to be as much 
as possible with charlotte she went thither every morning 
as soon as she was dressed and did not return till late 
in the evening and the miss dashwoods at the particular 
request of the middletons spent the whole of every day 
in every day in conduit street for their own comfort 
they would much rather have remained at least all 
the morning in mrs jennings s house but it was not 
a thing to be urged against the wishes of everybody 
their hours were therefore made over to lady middleton 
and the two miss steeles by whom their company in fact 
was as little valued as it was professedly sought 
they had too much sense to be desirable companions 
to the former and by the latter they were considered with 
a jealous eye as intruding on their ground and sharing 
the kindness which they wanted to monopolize though nothing 
could be more polite than lady middleton s behaviour to 
elinor and marianne she did not really like them at all 
because they neither flattered herself nor her children 
she could not believe them good natured and because they 
were fond of reading she fancied them satirical perhaps 
without exactly knowing what it was to be satirical 
but that did not signify it was censure in common use 
and easily given 
their presence was a restraint both on her and on lucy 
it checked the idleness of one and the business of the other 
lady middleton was ashamed of doing nothing before them 
and the flattery which lucy was proud to think of 
and administer at other times she feared they would despise 
her for offering miss steele was the least discomposed 
of the three by their presence and it was in their power 
to reconcile her to it entirely would either of them 
only have given her a full and minute account of the whole 
affair between marianne and mr willoughby she would 
have thought herself amply rewarded for the sacrifice 
of the best place by the fire after dinner which their 
arrival occasioned but this conciliation was not granted 
for though she often threw out expressions of pity for her 
sister to elinor and more than once dropt a reflection 
on the inconstancy of beaux before marianne no effect 
was produced but a look of indifference from the former 
or of disgust in the latter an effort even yet lighter 
might have made her their friend would they only have 
laughed at her about the doctor but so little were they 
anymore than the others inclined to oblige her 
that if sir john dined from home she might spend a whole 
day without hearing any other raillery on the subject 
than what she was kind enough to bestow on herself 
all these jealousies and discontents however were so 
totally unsuspected by mrs jennings that she thought 
it a delightful thing for the girls to be together 
and generally congratulated her young friends every night 
on having escaped the company of a stupid old woman so long 
she joined them sometimes at sir john s sometimes 
at her own house but wherever it was she always came 
in excellent spirits full of delight and importance 
attributing charlotte s well doing to her own care and ready 
to give so exact so minute a detail of her situation 
as only miss steele had curiosity enough to desire 
one thing did disturb her and of that she made her 
daily complaint mr palmer maintained the common 
but unfatherly opinion among his sex of all infants being alike 
and though she could plainly perceive at different times 
the most striking resemblance between this baby and every 
one of his relations on both sides there was no convincing 
his father of it no persuading him to believe that it 
was not exactly like every other baby of the same age 
nor could he even be brought to acknowledge the simple 
proposition of its being the finest child in the world 
i come now to the relation of a misfortune 
which about this time befell mrs john dashwood 
it so happened that while her two sisters with 
mrs jennings were first calling on her in harley street 
another of her acquaintance had dropt in a circumstance 
in itself not apparently likely to produce evil to her 
but while the imaginations of other people will carry 
them away to form wrong judgments of our conduct 
and to decide on it by slight appearances one s happiness 
must in some measure be always at the mercy of chance 
in the present instance this last arrived lady allowed 
her fancy to so far outrun truth and probability 
that on merely hearing the name of the miss dashwoods 
and understanding them to be mr dashwood s sisters 
she immediately concluded them to be staying in harley street 
and this misconstruction produced within a day 
or two afterwards cards of invitation for them 
as well as for their brother and sister to a small 
musical party at her house the consequence of which was 
that mrs john dashwood was obliged to submit not only 
to the exceedingly great inconvenience of sending her 
carriage for the miss dashwoods but what was still worse 
must be subject to all the unpleasantness of appearing 
to treat them with attention and who could tell that they 
might not expect to go out with her a second time the power 
of disappointing them it was true must always be her s 
but that was not enough for when people are determined 
on a mode of conduct which they know to be wrong they feel 
injured by the expectation of any thing better from them 
marianne had now been brought by degrees so much 
into the habit of going out every day that it was become 
a matter of indifference to her whether she went or not 
and she prepared quietly and mechanically for every 
evening s engagement though without expecting the smallest 
amusement from any and very often without knowing 
till the last moment where it was to take her 
to her dress and appearance she was grown so perfectly 
indifferent as not to bestow half the consideration on it 
during the whole of her toilet which it received from 
miss steele in the first five minutes of their being 
together when it was finished nothing escaped her minute 
observation and general curiosity she saw every thing 
and asked every thing was never easy till she knew the price 
of every part of marianne s dress could have guessed the 
number of her gowns altogether with better judgment than 
marianne herself and was not without hopes of finding out 
before they parted how much her washing cost per week 
and how much she had every year to spend upon herself 
the impertinence of these kind of scrutinies moreover 
was generally concluded with a compliment which 
though meant as its douceur was considered by marianne 
as the greatest impertinence of all for after undergoing 
an examination into the value and make of her gown 
the colour of her shoes and the arrangement of her hair 
she was almost sure of being told that upon her word 
she looked vastly smart and she dared to say she would 
make a great many conquests 
with such encouragement as this was she dismissed 
on the present occasion to her brother s carriage 
which they were ready to enter five minutes after it 
stopped at the door a punctuality not very agreeable 
to their sister in law who had preceded them to the house 
of her acquaintance and was there hoping for some delay 
on their part that might inconvenience either herself 
or her coachman 
the events of this evening were not very remarkable 
the party like other musical parties comprehended a 
great many people who had real taste for the performance 
and a great many more who had none at all and the performers 
themselves were as usual in their own estimation 
and that of their immediate friends the first private 
performers in england 
as elinor was neither musical nor affecting to be so 
she made no scruple of turning her eyes from the grand 
pianoforte whenever it suited her and unrestrained even 
by the presence of a harp and violoncello would fix 
them at pleasure on any other object in the room in one 
of these excursive glances she perceived among a group 
of young men the very he who had given them a lecture 
on toothpick cases at gray s she perceived him soon 
afterwards looking at herself and speaking familiarly 
to her brother and had just determined to find out his 
name from the latter when they both came towards her 
and mr dashwood introduced him to her as mr robert ferrars 
he addressed her with easy civility and twisted 
his head into a bow which assured her as plainly as 
words could have done that he was exactly the coxcomb 
she had heard him described to be by lucy happy had 
it been for her if her regard for edward had depended 
less on his own merit than on the merit of his nearest 
relations for then his brother s bow must have given 
the finishing stroke to what the ill humour of his mother 
and sister would have begun but while she wondered 
at the difference of the two young men she did not find 
that the emptiness of conceit of the one put her out 
of all charity with the modesty and worth of the other 
why they were different robert exclaimed to her himself 
in the course of a quarter of an hour s conversation 
for talking of his brother and lamenting the extreme 
gaucherie which he really believed kept him from mixing 
in proper society he candidly and generously attributed it 
much less to any natural deficiency than to the misfortune 
of a private education while he himself though probably 
without any particular any material superiority 
by nature merely from the advantage of a public school 
was as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man 
upon my soul he added i believe it is nothing more 
and so i often tell my mother when she is grieving 
about it my dear madam i always say to her you must 
make yourself easy the evil is now irremediable 
and it has been entirely your own doing why would 
you be persuaded by my uncle sir robert against your 
own judgment to place edward under private tuition 
at the most critical time of his life if you had only sent 
him to westminster as well as myself instead of sending 
him to mr pratt s all this would have been prevented 
this is the way in which i always consider the matter 
and my mother is perfectly convinced of her error 
elinor would not oppose his opinion because 
whatever might be her general estimation of the advantage 
of a public school she could not think of edward s 
abode in mr pratt s family with any satisfaction 
you reside in devonshire i think was his 
next observation in a cottage near dawlish 
elinor set him right as to its situation 
and it seemed rather surprising to him that anybody 
could live in devonshire without living near dawlish 
he bestowed his hearty approbation however on their 
species of house 
for my own part said he i am excessively fond 
of a cottage there is always so much comfort so much 
elegance about them and i protest if i had any money 
to spare i should buy a little land and build one myself 
within a short distance of london where i might drive 
myself down at any time and collect a few friends 
about me and be happy i advise every body who is going 
to build to build a cottage my friend lord courtland 
came to me the other day on purpose to ask my advice 
and laid before me three different plans of bonomi s 
i was to decide on the best of them my dear courtland 
said i immediately throwing them all into the fire do not 
adopt either of them but by all means build a cottage 
and that i fancy will be the end of it 
some people imagine that there can be no accommodations 
no space in a cottage but this is all a mistake 
i was last month at my friend elliott s near dartford 
lady elliott wished to give a dance but how can it 
be done said she my dear ferrars do tell me how it 
is to be managed there is not a room in this cottage 
that will hold ten couple and where can the supper be 
i immediately saw that there could be no difficulty in it 
so i said my dear lady elliott do not be uneasy 
the dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease 
card tables may be placed in the drawing room the library 
may be open for tea and other refreshments and let the 
supper be set out in the saloon lady elliott was delighted 
with the thought we measured the dining room and found 
it would hold exactly eighteen couple and the affair 
was arranged precisely after my plan so that in fact 
you see if people do but know how to set about it 
every comfort may be as well enjoyed in a cottage 
as in the most spacious dwelling 
elinor agreed to it all for she did not think 
he deserved the compliment of rational opposition 
as john dashwood had no more pleasure in music than his 
eldest sister his mind was equally at liberty to fix on 
any thing else and a thought struck him during the evening 
which he communicated to his wife for her approbation 
when they got home the consideration of mrs dennison s 
mistake 
in supposing his sisters their guests had suggested the 
propriety of their being really invited to become such 
while mrs jenning s engagements kept her from home 
the expense would be nothing the inconvenience not more 
and it was altogether an attention which the delicacy 
of his conscience pointed out to be requisite to its 
complete enfranchisement from his promise to his father 
fanny was startled at the proposal 
i do not see how it can be done said she 
without affronting lady middleton for they spend every day 
with her otherwise i should be exceedingly glad to do it 
you know i am always ready to pay them any attention 
in my power as my taking them out this evening shews 
but they are lady middleton s visitors how can i ask them 
away from her 
her husband but with great humility did not see 
the force of her objection they had already spent a week 
in this manner in conduit street and lady middleton 
could not be displeased at their giving the same number 
of days to such near relations 
fanny paused a moment and then with fresh vigor said 
my love i would ask them with all my heart if it 
was in my power but i had just settled within myself 
to ask the miss steeles to spend a few days with us 
they are very well behaved good kind of girls and i think 
the attention is due to them as their uncle did so very 
well by edward we can ask your sisters some other year 
you know but the miss steeles may not be in town any more 
i am sure you will like them indeed you do like them 
you know very much already and so does my mother and they 
are such favourites with harry 
mr dashwood was convinced he saw the necessity 
of inviting the miss steeles immediately and his conscience 
was pacified by the resolution of inviting his sisters 
another year at the same time however slyly suspecting 
that another year would make the invitation needless 
by bringing elinor to town as colonel brandon s wife 
and marianne as their visitor 
fanny rejoicing in her escape and proud of the ready 
wit that had procured it wrote the next morning to lucy 
to request her company and her sister s for some days 
in harley street as soon as lady middleton could spare them 
this was enough to make lucy really and reasonably happy 
mrs dashwood seemed actually working for her herself 
cherishing all her hopes and promoting all her views 
such an opportunity of being with edward and his family was 
above all things the most material to her interest 
and such an invitation the most gratifying to her 
feelings it was an advantage that could not be too 
gratefully acknowledged nor too speedily made use of 
and the visit to lady middleton which had not before had 
any precise limits was instantly discovered to have been 
always meant to end in two days time 
when the note was shown to elinor as it was within ten 
minutes after its arrival it gave her for the first time 
some share in the expectations of lucy for such a mark 
of uncommon kindness vouchsafed on so short an acquaintance 
seemed to declare that the good will towards her arose 
from something more than merely malice against herself 
and might be brought by time and address to do 
every thing that lucy wished her flattery had already 
subdued the pride of lady middleton and made an entry 
into the close heart of mrs john dashwood and these 
were effects that laid open the probability of greater 
the miss steeles removed to harley street and all 
that reached elinor of their influence there strengthened 
her expectation of the event sir john who called on 
them more than once brought home such accounts of the 
favour they were in as must be universally striking 
mrs dashwood had never been so much pleased with any 
young women in her life as she was with them had given 
each of them a needle book made by some emigrant 
called lucy by her christian name and did not know 
whether she should ever be able to part with them 
at this point in the first and second edtions volume ii ended 
chapter 
mrs palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight 
that her mother felt it no longer necessary to give up 
the whole of her time to her and contenting herself with 
visiting her once or twice a day returned from that period 
to her own home and her own habits in which she found 
the miss dashwoods very ready to resume their former share 
about the third or fourth morning after their 
being thus resettled in berkeley street mrs jennings 
on returning from her ordinary visit to mrs palmer 
entered the drawing room where elinor was sitting 
by herself with an air of such hurrying importance 
as prepared her to hear something wonderful and giving her 
time only to form that idea began directly to justify it 
by saying 
lord my dear miss dashwood have you heard the news 
no madam what is it 
something so strange but you shall hear it all 
when i got to mr palmer s i found charlotte quite 
in a fuss about the child she was sure it was very 
ill it cried and fretted and was all over pimples 
so i looked at it directly and lord my dear 
says i it is nothing in the world but the red gum 
and nurse said just the same but charlotte she would 
not be satisfied so mr donavan was sent for and luckily 
he happened to just come in from harley street so he 
stepped over directly and as soon as ever he saw the child 
be said just as we did that it was nothing in the world 
but the red gum and then charlotte was easy and so 
just as he was going away again it came into my head 
i am sure i do not know how i happened to think of it 
but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news 
so upon that he smirked and simpered and looked grave 
and seemed to know something or other and at last he 
said in a whisper for fear any unpleasant report 
should reach the young ladies under your care as to their 
sister s indisposition i think it advisable to say 
that i believe there is no great reason for alarm i hope 
mrs dashwood will do very well 
what is fanny ill 
that is exactly what i said my dear lord says i 
is mrs dashwood ill so then it all came out and the 
long and the short of the matter by all i can learn 
seems to be this mr edward ferrars the very young 
man i used to joke with you about but however as it 
turns out i am monstrous glad there was never any thing 
in it mr edward ferrars it seems has been engaged 
above this twelvemonth to my cousin lucy there is for you 
my dear and not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter 
except nancy could you have believed such a thing possible 
there is no great wonder in their liking one another 
but that matters should be brought so forward between them 
and nobody suspect it that is strange i never happened 
to see them together or i am sure i should have found it 
out directly well and so this was kept a great secret 
for fear of mrs ferrars and neither she nor your 
brother or sister suspected a word of the matter 
till this very morning poor nancy who you know is a 
well meaning creature but no conjurer popt it all out 
lord thinks she to herself they are all so fond 
of lucy to be sure they will make no difficulty about it 
and so away she went to your sister who was sitting all 
alone at her carpet work little suspecting what was to 
come for she had just been saying to your brother only five 
minutes before that she thought to make a match between 
edward and some lord s daughter or other i forget who 
so you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity 
and pride she fell into violent hysterics immediately 
with such screams as reached your brother s ears 
as he was sitting in his own dressing room down stairs 
thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country 
so up he flew directly and a terrible scene took place 
for lucy was come to them by that time little dreaming 
what was going on poor soul i pity her and i must say 
i think she was used very hardly for your sister scolded 
like any fury and soon drove her into a fainting fit 
nancy she fell upon her knees and cried bitterly 
and your brother he walked about the room and said 
he did not know what to do mrs dashwood declared 
they should not stay a minute longer in the house 
and your brother was forced to go down upon his knees too 
to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed 
up their clothes then she fell into hysterics again 
and he was so frightened that he would send for mr donavan 
and mr donavan found the house in all this uproar 
the carriage was at the door ready to take my poor 
cousins away and they were just stepping in as he 
came off poor lucy in such a condition he says 
she could hardly walk and nancy she was almost as bad 
i declare i have no patience with your sister and i hope 
with all my heart it will be a match in spite of her 
lord what a taking poor mr edward will be in when he 
hears of it to have his love used so scornfully for 
they say he is monstrous fond of her as well he may 
i should not wonder if he was to be in the greatest 
passion and mr donavan thinks just the same he and i 
had a great deal of talk about it and the best of all is 
that he is gone back again to harley street that he may 
be within call when mrs ferrars is told of it for she 
was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house 
for your sister was sure she would be in hysterics too 
and so she may for what i care i have no pity for 
either of them i have no notion of people s making 
such a to do about money and greatness there is no 
reason on earth why mr edward and lucy should not marry 
for i am sure mrs ferrars may afford to do very well 
by her son and though lucy has next to nothing herself 
she knows better than any body how to make the most 
of every thing i dare say if mrs ferrars would only 
allow him five hundred a year she would make as good 
an appearance with it as any body else would with eight 
lord how snug they might live in such another cottage 
as yours or a little bigger with two maids and two men 
and i believe i could help them to a housemaid for my 
betty has a sister out of place that would fit them 
exactly 
here mrs jennings ceased and as elinor had had 
time enough to collect her thoughts she was able 
to give such an answer and make such observations 
as the subject might naturally be supposed to produce 
happy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary 
interest in it that mrs jennings as she had of late 
often hoped might be the case had ceased to imagine her 
at all attached to edward and happy above all the rest 
in the absence of marianne she felt very well able 
to speak of the affair without embarrassment and to 
give her judgment as she believed with impartiality 
on the conduct of every one concerned in it 
she could hardly determine what her own expectation 
of its event really was though she earnestly tried 
to drive away the notion of its being possible to end 
otherwise at last than in the marriage of edward and lucy 
what mrs ferrars would say and do though there could 
not be a doubt of its nature she was anxious to hear 
and still more anxious to know how edward would 
conduct himself for him she felt much compassion 
for lucy very little and it cost her some pains to procure 
that little for the rest of the party none at all 
as mrs jennings could talk on no other subject 
elinor soon saw the necessity of preparing marianne for 
its discussion no time was to be lost in undeceiving her 
in making her acquainted with the real truth and in 
endeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by others 
without betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister 
or any resentment against edward 
elinor s office was a painful one she was going 
to remove what she really believed to be her sister s 
chief consolation to give such particulars of edward as she 
feared would ruin him for ever in her good opinion and 
to make marianne by a resemblance in their situations 
which to her fancy would seem strong feel all her own 
disappointment over again but unwelcome as such a task 
must be it was necessary to be done and elinor therefore 
hastened to perform it 
she was very far from wishing to dwell on her own 
feelings or to represent herself as suffering much 
any otherwise than as the self command she had practised 
since her first knowledge of edward s engagement might 
suggest a hint of what was practicable to marianne 
her narration was clear and simple and though it could 
not be given without emotion it was not accompanied 
by violent agitation nor impetuous grief that belonged 
rather to the hearer for marianne listened with horror 
and cried excessively elinor was to be the comforter 
of others in her own distresses no less than in theirs 
and all the comfort that could be given by assurances 
of her own composure of mind and a very earnest 
vindication of edward from every charge but of imprudence 
was readily offered 
but marianne for some time would give credit to neither 
edward seemed a second willoughby and acknowledging 
as elinor did that she had loved him most sincerely 
could she feel less than herself as for lucy steele 
she considered her so totally unamiable so absolutely 
incapable of attaching a sensible man that she could 
not be persuaded at first to believe and afterwards 
to pardon any former affection of edward for her 
she would not even admit it to have been natural 
and elinor left her to be convinced that it was so 
by that which only could convince her a better knowledge 
of mankind 
her first communication had reached no farther than 
to state the fact of the engagement and the length of time 
it had existed marianne s feelings had then broken in 
and put an end to all regularity of detail and for some 
time all that could be done was to soothe her distress 
lessen her alarms and combat her resentment the first 
question on her side which led to farther particulars 
was 
how long has this been known to you elinor has 
he written to you 
i have known it these four months when lucy 
first came to barton park last november she told me 
in confidence of her engagement 
at these words marianne s eyes expressed the astonishment 
which her lips could not utter after a pause of wonder 
she exclaimed 
four months have you known of this four months 
elinor confirmed it 
what while attending me in all my misery has this 
been on your heart and i have reproached you for being 
happy 
it was not fit that you should then know how much 
i was the reverse 
four months cried marianne again so calm 
so cheerful how have you been supported 
by feeling that i was doing my duty my promise to 
lucy obliged me to be secret i owed it to her therefore 
to avoid giving any hint of the truth and i owed it to my 
family and friends not to create in them a solicitude about me 
which it could not be in my power to satisfy 
marianne seemed much struck 
i have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my 
mother added elinor and once or twice i have attempted it 
but without betraying my trust i never could have convinced 
you 
four months and yet you loved him 
yes but i did not love only him and while the comfort 
of others was dear to me i was glad to spare them from knowing 
how much i felt now i can think and speak of it with 
little emotion i would not have you suffer on my account 
for i assure you i no longer suffer materially myself 
i have many things to support me i am not conscious of having 
provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my own 
i have borne it as much as possible without spreading 
it farther i acquit edward of essential misconduct 
i wish him very happy and i am so sure of his always 
doing his duty that though now he may harbour some regret 
in the end he must become so lucy does not want sense 
and that is the foundation on which every thing good may 
be built and after all marianne after all that is 
bewitching in the idea of a single and constant attachment 
and all that can be said of one s happiness depending 
entirely on any particular person it is not meant it 
is not fit it is not possible that it should be so 
edward will marry lucy he will marry a woman superior 
in person and understanding to half her sex and time 
and habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought 
another superior to her 
if such is your way of thinking said marianne 
if the loss of what is most valued is so easily 
to be made up by something else your resolution 
your self command are perhaps a little less to be 
wondered at they are brought more within my comprehension 
i understand you you do not suppose that i have ever 
felt much for four months marianne i have had all this 
hanging on my mind without being at liberty to speak 
of it to a single creature knowing that it would make 
you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained 
to you yet unable to prepare you for it in the least 
it was told me it was in a manner forced on me by the 
very person herself whose prior engagement ruined all 
my prospects and told me as i thought with triumph 
this person s suspicions therefore i have had to oppose 
by endeavouring to appear indifferent where i have been most 
deeply interested and it has not been only once i have 
had her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again 
i have known myself to be divided from edward for ever 
without hearing one circumstance that could make me less 
desire the connection nothing has proved him unworthy 
nor has anything declared him indifferent to me 
i have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister 
and the insolence of his mother and have suffered the 
punishment of an attachment without enjoying its advantages 
and all this has been going on at a time when as you 
know too well it has not been my only unhappiness 
if you can think me capable of ever feeling surely you 
may suppose that i have suffered now the composure 
of mind with which i have brought myself at present 
to consider the matter the consolation that i have been 
willing to admit have been the effect of constant and 
painful exertion they did not spring up of themselves 
they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first 
no marianne then if i had not been bound to silence 
perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely not even what i 
owed to my dearest friends from openly shewing that i was 
very unhappy 
marianne was quite subdued 
oh elinor she cried you have made me hate 
myself for ever how barbarous have i been to you 
you who have been my only comfort who have borne with me 
in all my misery who have seemed to be only suffering 
for me is this my gratitude is this the only return i 
can make you because your merit cries out upon myself 
i have been trying to do it away 
the tenderest caresses followed this confession 
in such a frame of mind as she was now in elinor had 
no difficulty in obtaining from her whatever promise 
she required and at her request marianne engaged 
never to speak of the affair to any one with the least 
appearance of bitterness to meet lucy without betraying 
the smallest increase of dislike to her and even to see 
edward himself if chance should bring them together 
without any diminution of her usual cordiality 
these were great concessions but where marianne felt 
that she had injured no reparation could be too much 
for her to make 
she performed her promise of being discreet 
to admiration she attended to all that mrs jennings 
had to say upon the subject with an unchanging complexion 
dissented from her in nothing and was heard three 
times to say yes madam she listened to her praise 
of lucy with only moving from one chair to another 
and when mrs jennings talked of edward s affection 
it cost her only a spasm in her throat such advances 
towards heroism in her sister made elinor feel equal 
to any thing herself 
the next morning brought a farther trial of it 
in a visit from their brother who came with a most serious 
aspect to talk over the dreadful affair and bring them 
news of his wife 
you have heard i suppose said he with great solemnity 
as soon as he was seated of the very shocking discovery 
that took place under our roof yesterday 
they all looked their assent it seemed too awful 
a moment for speech 
your sister he continued has suffered dreadfully 
mrs ferrars too in short it has been a scene of such 
complicated distress but i will hope that the storm may 
be weathered without our being any of us quite overcome 
poor fanny she was in hysterics all yesterday 
but i would not alarm you too much donavan says there 
is nothing materially to be apprehended her constitution 
is a good one and her resolution equal to any thing 
she has borne it all with the fortitude of an angel 
she says she never shall think well of anybody again 
and one cannot wonder at it after being so deceived 
meeting with such ingratitude where so much kindness 
had been shewn so much confidence had been placed it 
was quite out of the benevolence of her heart that she 
had asked these young women to her house merely because 
she thought they deserved some attention were harmless 
well behaved girls and would be pleasant companions 
for otherwise we both wished very much to have invited you 
and marianne to be with us while your kind friend there 
was attending her daughter and now to be so rewarded 
i wish with all my heart says poor fanny in her 
affectionate way that we had asked your sisters instead 
of them 
here he stopped to be thanked which being done 
he went on 
what poor mrs ferrars suffered when first fanny 
broke it to her is not to be described while she with 
the truest affection had been planning a most eligible 
connection for him was it to be supposed that he could 
be all the time secretly engaged to another person such 
a suspicion could never have entered her head if she 
suspected any prepossession elsewhere it could not be 
in that quarter there to be sure said she i might 
have thought myself safe she was quite in an agony 
we consulted together however as to what should be done 
and at last she determined to send for edward 
he came but i am sorry to relate what ensued 
all that mrs ferrars could say to make him put an end 
to the engagement assisted too as you may well suppose 
by my arguments and fanny s entreaties was of 
no avail duty affection every thing was disregarded 
i never thought edward so stubborn so unfeeling before 
his mother explained to him her liberal designs in case 
of his marrying miss morton told him she would settle on 
him the norfolk estate which clear of land tax brings 
in a good thousand a year offered even when matters 
grew desperate to make it twelve hundred and in opposition 
to this if he still persisted in this low connection 
represented to him the certain penury that must attend 
the match his own two thousand pounds she protested 
should be his all she would never see him again and so far 
would she be from affording him the smallest assistance 
that if he were to enter into any profession with a view 
of better support she would do all in her power to prevent 
him advancing in it 
here marianne in an ecstasy of indignation 
clapped her hands together and cried gracious god 
can this be possible 
well may you wonder marianne replied her brother 
at the obstinacy which could resist such arguments as these 
your exclamation is very natural 
marianne was going to retort but she remembered 
her promises and forbore 
all this however he continued was urged in vain 
edward said very little but what he did say was in 
the most determined manner nothing should prevail on 
him to give up his engagement he would stand to it 
cost him what it might 
then cried mrs jennings with blunt sincerity 
no longer able to be silent he has acted like an honest 
man i beg your pardon mr dashwood but if he had 
done otherwise i should have thought him a rascal 
i have some little concern in the business as well 
as yourself for lucy steele is my cousin and i believe 
there is not a better kind of girl in the world nor one 
who more deserves a good husband 
john dashwood was greatly astonished but his nature 
was calm not open to provocation and he never wished 
to offend anybody especially anybody of good fortune 
he therefore replied without any resentment 
i would by no means speak disrespectfully of any 
relation of yours madam miss lucy steele is i dare say 
a very deserving young woman but in the present case 
you know the connection must be impossible 
and to have entered into a secret engagement with a 
young man under her uncle s care the son of a woman 
especially of such very large fortune as mrs ferrars 
is perhaps altogether a little extraordinary in short 
i do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person 
whom you have a regard for mrs jennings we all wish 
her extremely happy and mrs ferrars s conduct throughout 
the whole has been such as every conscientious good mother 
in like circumstances would adopt it has been dignified 
and liberal edward has drawn his own lot and i fear 
it will be a bad one 
marianne sighed out her similar apprehension 
and elinor s heart wrung for the feelings of edward 
while braving his mother s threats for a woman who could 
not reward him 
well sir said mrs jennings and how did it end 
i am sorry to say madam in a most unhappy rupture 
edward is dismissed for ever from his mother s notice 
he left her house yesterday but where he is gone or whether 
he is still in town i do not know for we of course can 
make no inquiry 
poor young man and what is to become of him 
what indeed madam it is a melancholy consideration 
born to the prospect of such affluence i cannot conceive 
a situation more deplorable the interest of two thousand 
pounds how can a man live on it and when to that is added 
the recollection that he might but for his own folly 
within three months have been in the receipt of two 
thousand five hundred a year for miss morton has 
thirty thousand pounds i cannot picture to myself 
a more wretched condition we must all feel for him 
and the more so because it is totally out of our power 
to assist him 
poor young man cried mrs jennings i am sure 
he should be very welcome to bed and board at my house 
and so i would tell him if i could see him it is not fit 
that he should be living about at his own charge now 
at lodgings and taverns 
elinor s heart thanked her for such kindness towards edward 
though she could not forbear smiling at the form of it 
if he would only have done as well by himself 
said john dashwood as all his friends were disposed to do 
by him he might now have been in his proper situation 
and would have wanted for nothing but as it is it must 
be out of anybody s power to assist him and there is one 
thing more preparing against him which must be worse than 
all his mother has determined with a very natural kind 
of spirit to settle that estate upon robert immediately 
which might have been edward s on proper conditions 
i left her this morning with her lawyer talking over 
the business 
well said mrs jennings that is her revenge 
everybody has a way of their own but i do not think mine 
would be to make one son independent because another had 
plagued me 
marianne got up and walked about the room 
can anything be more galling to the spirit of a man 
continued john than to see his younger brother in 
possession of an estate which might have been his own 
poor edward i feel for him sincerely 
a few minutes more spent in the same kind of effusion 
concluded his visit and with repeated assurances to his 
sisters that he really believed there was no material 
danger in fanny s indisposition and that they need 
not therefore be very uneasy about it he went away 
leaving the three ladies unanimous in their sentiments 
on the present occasion as far at least as it regarded 
mrs ferrars s conduct the dashwoods and edward s 
marianne s indignation burst forth as soon as he 
quitted the room and as her vehemence made reserve 
impossible in elinor and unnecessary in mrs jennings 
they all joined in a very spirited critique upon the party 
chapter 
mrs jennings was very warm in her praise of edward s 
conduct but only elinor and marianne understood its 
true merit they only knew how little he had had to tempt 
him to be disobedient and how small was the consolation 
beyond the consciousness of doing right that could 
remain to him in the loss of friends and fortune 
elinor gloried in his integrity and marianne forgave all 
his offences in compassion for his punishment but though 
confidence between them was by this public discovery 
restored to its proper state it was not a subject on 
which either of them were fond of dwelling when alone 
elinor avoided it upon principle as tending to fix still 
more upon her thoughts by the too warm too positive 
assurances of marianne that belief of edward s continued 
affection for herself which she rather wished to do away 
and marianne s courage soon failed her in trying 
to converse upon a topic which always left her more 
dissatisfied with herself than ever by the comparison 
it necessarily produced between elinor s conduct and her own 
she felt all the force of that comparison but not 
as her sister had hoped to urge her to exertion now 
she felt it with all the pain of continual self reproach 
regretted most bitterly that she had never exerted 
herself before but it brought only the torture of penitence 
without the hope of amendment her mind was so much weakened 
that she still fancied present exertion impossible 
and therefore it only dispirited her more 
nothing new was heard by them for a day or two afterwards 
of affairs in harley street or bartlett s buildings 
but though so much of the matter was known to them already 
that mrs jennings might have had enough to do in spreading 
that knowledge farther without seeking after more 
she had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort 
and inquiry to her cousins as soon as she could 
and nothing but the hindrance of more visitors than usual 
had prevented her going to them within that time 
the third day succeeding their knowledge of the 
particulars was so fine so beautiful a sunday as to draw 
many to kensington gardens though it was only the second 
week in march mrs jennings and elinor were of the number 
but marianne who knew that the willoughbys were again 
in town and had a constant dread of meeting them 
chose rather to stay at home than venture into so public 
a place 
an intimate acquaintance of mrs jennings joined 
them soon after they entered the gardens and elinor was 
not sorry that by her continuing with them and engaging 
all mrs jennings s conversation she was herself left 
to quiet reflection she saw nothing of the willoughbys 
nothing of edward and for some time nothing of anybody 
who could by any chance whether grave or gay be interesting 
to her but at last she found herself with some surprise 
accosted by miss steele who though looking rather shy 
expressed great satisfaction in meeting them and on receiving 
encouragement from the particular kindness of mrs jennings 
left her own party for a short time to join their s 
mrs jennings immediately whispered to elinor 
get it all out of her my dear she will tell you 
any thing if you ask you see i cannot leave mrs clarke 
it was lucky however for mrs jennings s curiosity 
and elinor s too that she would tell any thing without 
being asked for nothing would otherwise have been learnt 
i am so glad to meet you said miss steele 
taking her familiarly by the arm for i wanted to see you 
of all things in the world and then lowering her voice 
i suppose mrs jennings has heard all about it 
is she angry 
not at all i believe with you 
that is a good thing and lady middleton is she angry 
i cannot suppose it possible that she should 
i am monstrous glad of it good gracious i have 
had such a time of it i never saw lucy in such a rage 
in my life she vowed at first she would never trim me 
up a new bonnet nor do any thing else for me again 
so long as she lived but now she is quite come to 
and we are as good friends as ever look she made me 
this bow to my hat and put in the feather last night 
there now you are going to laugh at me too but why 
should not i wear pink ribbons i do not care if it is 
the doctor s favourite colour i am sure for my part 
i should never have known he did like it better than 
any other colour if he had not happened to say so 
my cousins have been so plaguing me i declare sometimes 
i do not know which way to look before them 
she had wandered away to a subject on which elinor 
had nothing to say and therefore soon judged it expedient 
to find her way back again to the first 
well but miss dashwood speaking triumphantly 
people may say what they chuse about mr ferrars s 
declaring he would not have lucy for it is no such thing 
i can tell you and it is quite a shame for such ill natured 
reports to be spread abroad whatever lucy might think 
about it herself you know it was no business of other 
people to set it down for certain 
i never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before 
i assure you said elinor 
oh did not you but it was said i know very well 
and by more than one for miss godby told miss sparks 
that nobody in their senses could expect mr ferrars 
to give up a woman like miss morton with thirty thousand 
pounds to her fortune for lucy steele that had 
nothing at all and i had it from miss sparks myself 
and besides that my cousin richard said himself 
that when it came to the point he was afraid mr ferrars 
would be off and when edward did not come near us 
for three days i could not tell what to think myself 
and i believe in my heart lucy gave it up all for lost 
for we came away from your brother s wednesday 
and we saw nothing of him not all thursday friday 
and saturday and did not know what was become of him 
once lucy thought to write to him but then her spirits 
rose against that however this morning he came just 
as we came home from church and then it all came out 
how he had been sent for wednesday to harley street 
and been talked to by his mother and all of them 
and how he had declared before them all that he loved 
nobody but lucy and nobody but lucy would he have 
and how he had been so worried by what passed 
that as soon as he had went away from his mother s house 
he had got upon his horse and rid into the country 
some where or other and how he had stayed about at an inn 
all thursday and friday on purpose to get the better 
of it and after thinking it all over and over again 
he said it seemed to him as if now he had no fortune 
and no nothing at all it would be quite unkind to keep 
her on to the engagement because it must be for her loss 
for he had nothing but two thousand pounds and no hope 
of any thing else and if he was to go into orders 
as he had some thoughts he could get nothing but a curacy 
and how was they to live upon that he could not bear 
to think of her doing no better and so he begged 
if she had the least mind for it to put an end to the 
matter directly and leave him shift for himself 
i heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be 
and it was entirely for her sake and upon her account 
that he said a word about being off and not upon his own 
i will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being 
tired of her or of wishing to marry miss morton or any 
thing like it but to be sure lucy would not give 
ear to such kind of talking so she told him directly 
with a great deal about sweet and love you know 
and all that oh la one cannot repeat such kind of things 
you know she told him directly she had not the least 
mind in the world to be off for she could live with him 
upon a trifle and how little so ever he might have 
she should be very glad to have it all you know 
or something of the kind so then he was monstrous happy 
and talked on some time about what they should do 
and they agreed he should take orders directly 
and they must wait to be married till he got a living 
and just then i could not hear any more for my cousin 
called from below to tell me mrs richardson was come in 
her coach and would take one of us to kensington gardens 
so i was forced to go into the room and interrupt them 
to ask lucy if she would like to go but she did not 
care to leave edward so i just run up stairs and put 
on a pair of silk stockings and came off with the richardsons 
i do not understand what you mean by interrupting them 
said elinor you were all in the same room together 
were not you 
no indeed not us la miss dashwood do you 
think people make love when any body else is by oh 
for shame to be sure you must know better than that 
laughing affectedly no no they were shut up in the 
drawing room together and all i heard was only by listening 
at the door 
how cried elinor have you been repeating to me 
what you only learnt yourself by listening at the door 
i am sorry i did not know it before for i certainly 
would not have suffered you to give me particulars of a 
conversation which you ought not to have known yourself 
how could you behave so unfairly by your sister 
oh la there is nothing in that i only stood at 
the door and heard what i could and i am sure lucy would 
have done just the same by me for a year or two back 
when martha sharpe and i had so many secrets together 
she never made any bones of hiding in a closet or behind 
a chimney board on purpose to hear what we said 
elinor tried to talk of something else but miss 
steele could not be kept beyond a couple of minutes 
from what was uppermost in her mind 
edward talks of going to oxford soon said she 
but now he is lodging at no pall mall what an 
ill natured woman his mother is an t she and your 
brother and sister were not very kind however 
i shall not say anything against them to you and to be sure 
they did send us home in their own chariot which 
was more than i looked for and for my part i was all 
in a fright for fear your sister should ask us for the 
huswifes she had gave us a day or two before but however 
nothing was said about them and i took care to keep mine 
out of sight edward have got some business at oxford 
he says so he must go there for a time and after that 
as soon as he can light upon a bishop he will be ordained 
i wonder what curacy he will get good gracious 
giggling as she spoke i would lay my life i know what 
my cousins will say when they hear of it they will 
tell me i should write to the doctor to get edward 
the curacy of his new living i know they will but i am 
sure i would not do such a thing for all the world 
la i shall say directly i wonder how you could think 
of such a thing i write to the doctor indeed 
well said elinor it is a comfort to be prepared 
against the worst you have got your answer ready 
miss steele was going to reply on the same subject 
but the approach of her own party made another more necessary 
oh la here come the richardsons i had a vast deal 
more to say to you but i must not stay away from them not 
any longer i assure you they are very genteel people 
he makes a monstrous deal of money and they keep their 
own coach i have not time to speak to mrs jennings about 
it myself but pray tell her i am quite happy to hear she 
is not in anger against us and lady middleton the same 
and if anything should happen to take you and your 
sister away and mrs jennings should want company 
i am sure we should be very glad to come and stay with her 
for as long a time as she likes i suppose lady middleton 
will not ask us any more this bout good by i am sorry 
miss marianne was not here remember me kindly to her 
la if you have not got your spotted muslin on i wonder 
you was not afraid of its being torn 
such was her parting concern for after this she had 
time only to pay her farewell compliments to mrs jennings 
before her company was claimed by mrs richardson 
and elinor was left in possession of knowledge which 
might feed her powers of reflection some time though she 
had learnt very little more than what had been already 
foreseen and foreplanned in her own mind edward s marriage 
with lucy was as firmly determined on and the time 
of its taking place remained as absolutely uncertain 
as she had concluded it would be every thing depended 
exactly after her expectation on his getting that preferment 
of which at present there seemed not the smallest chance 
as soon as they returned to the carriage 
mrs jennings was eager for information but as elinor 
wished to spread as little as possible intelligence 
that had in the first place been so unfairly obtained 
she confined herself to the brief repetition of such 
simple particulars as she felt assured that lucy 
for the sake of her own consequence would choose 
to have known the continuance of their engagement 
and the means that were able to be taken for promoting 
its end was all her communication and this produced 
from mrs jennings the following natural remark 
wait for his having a living ay we all know how 
that will end they will wait a twelvemonth and finding 
no good comes of it will set down upon a curacy of fifty 
pounds a year with the interest of his two thousand pounds 
and what little matter mr steele and mr pratt can 
give her then they will have a child every year and 
lord help them how poor they will be i must see 
what i can give them towards furnishing their house 
two maids and two men indeed as i talked of t other 
day no no they must get a stout girl of all works 
betty s sister would never do for them now 
the next morning brought elinor a letter by the 
two penny post from lucy herself it was as follows 
bartlett s building march 
i hope my dear miss dashwood will excuse the 
liberty i take of writing to her but i know your 
friendship for me will make you pleased to hear such 
a good account of myself and my dear edward after 
all the troubles we have went through lately 
therefore will make no more apologies but proceed 
to say that thank god though we have suffered 
dreadfully we are both quite well now and as happy 
as we must always be in one another s love we have 
had great trials and great persecutions but 
however at the same time gratefully acknowledge 
many friends yourself not the least among them 
whose great kindness i shall always thankfully 
remember as will edward too who i have told of 
it i am sure you will be glad to hear as likewise 
dear mrs jennings i spent two happy hours with 
him yesterday afternoon he would not hear of our 
parting though earnestly did i as i thought my 
duty required urge him to it for prudence sake 
and would have parted for ever on the spot would 
he consent to it but he said it should never be 
he did not regard his mother s anger while he could 
have my affections our prospects are not very 
bright to be sure but we must wait and hope for 
the best he will be ordained shortly and should 
it ever be in your power to recommend him to any 
body that has a living to bestow am very sure you 
will not forget us and dear mrs jennings too 
trust she will speak a good word for us to sir john 
or mr palmer or any friend that may be able to 
assist us poor anne was much to blame for what 
she did but she did it for the best so i say 
nothing hope mrs jennings will not think it too much 
trouble to give us a call should she come this way 
any morning twould be a great kindness and my 
cousins would be proud to know her my paper reminds 
me to conclude and begging to be most gratefully 
and respectfully remembered to her and to sir john 
and lady middleton and the dear children when you 
chance to see them and love to miss marianne 
i am c 
as soon as elinor had finished it she performed 
what she concluded to be its writer s real design 
by placing it in the hands of mrs jennings who read it 
aloud with many comments of satisfaction and praise 
very well indeed how prettily she writes aye 
that was quite proper to let him be off if he would 
that was just like lucy poor soul i wish i could get 
him a living with all my heart she calls me dear 
mrs jennings you see she is a good hearted girl 
as ever lived very well upon my word that sentence 
is very prettily turned yes yes i will go and see her 
sure enough how attentive she is to think of every 
body thank you my dear for shewing it me it is 
as pretty a letter as ever i saw and does lucy s head 
and heart great credit 
chapter 
the miss dashwoods had now been rather more than 
two months in town and marianne s impatience to be gone 
increased every day she sighed for the air the liberty 
the quiet of the country and fancied that if any place 
could give her ease barton must do it elinor was hardly 
less anxious than herself for their removal and only so much 
less bent on its being effected immediately as that she 
was conscious of the difficulties of so long a journey 
which marianne could not be brought to acknowledge 
she began however seriously to turn her thoughts towards 
its accomplishment and had already mentioned their wishes 
to their kind hostess who resisted them with all the 
eloquence of her good will when a plan was suggested 
which though detaining them from home yet a few weeks 
longer appeared to elinor altogether much more eligible 
than any other the palmers were to remove to cleveland 
about the end of march for the easter holidays 
and mrs jennings with both her friends received a very 
warm invitation from charlotte to go with them this would 
not in itself have been sufficient for the delicacy of 
miss dashwood but it was inforced with so much real 
politeness by mr palmer himself as joined to the very 
great amendment of his manners towards them since her 
sister had been known to be unhappy induced her to accept 
it with pleasure 
when she told marianne what she had done however 
her first reply was not very auspicious 
cleveland she cried with great agitation 
no i cannot go to cleveland 
you forget said elinor gently that its situation 
is not that it is not in the neighbourhood of 
but it is in somersetshire i cannot go 
into somersetshire there where i looked forward 
to going no elinor you cannot expect me to go there 
elinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming 
such feelings she only endeavoured to counteract them by 
working on others represented it therefore as a measure 
which would fix the time of her returning to that dear mother 
whom she so much wished to see in a more eligible 
more comfortable manner than any other plan could do 
and perhaps without any greater delay from cleveland 
which was within a few miles of bristol the distance to 
barton was not beyond one day though a long day s journey 
and their mother s servant might easily come there to attend 
them down and as there could be no occasion of their 
staying above a week at cleveland they might now be at 
home in little more than three weeks time as marianne s 
affection for her mother was sincere it must triumph 
with little difficulty over the imaginary evils she had started 
mrs jennings was so far from being weary of her guest 
that she pressed them very earnestly to return with her again 
from cleveland elinor was grateful for the attention 
but it could not alter her design and their mother s 
concurrence being readily gained every thing relative 
to their return was arranged as far as it could be 
and marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement 
of the hours that were yet to divide her from barton 
ah colonel i do not know what you and i shall 
do without the miss dashwoods was mrs jennings s 
address to him when he first called on her after their 
leaving her was settled for they are quite resolved 
upon going home from the palmers and how forlorn we 
shall be when i come back lord we shall sit and gape 
at one another as dull as two cats 
perhaps mrs jennings was in hopes by this vigorous 
sketch of their future ennui to provoke him to make 
that offer which might give himself an escape from it 
and if so she had soon afterwards good reason to think 
her object gained for on elinor s moving to the window 
to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print 
which she was going to copy for her friend he followed 
her to it with a look of particular meaning and conversed 
with her there for several minutes the effect of his 
discourse on the lady too could not escape her observation 
for though she was too honorable to listen and had even 
changed her seat on purpose that she might not hear 
to one close by the piano forte on which marianne 
was playing she could not keep herself from seeing 
that elinor changed colour attended with agitation 
and was too intent on what he said to pursue her employment 
still farther in confirmation of her hopes in the interval 
of marianne s turning from one lesson to another 
some words of the colonel s inevitably reached her ear 
in which he seemed to be apologising for the badness 
of his house this set the matter beyond a doubt 
she wondered indeed at his thinking it necessary 
to do so but supposed it to be the proper etiquette 
what elinor said in reply she could not distinguish 
but judged from the motion of her lips that she did 
not think that any material objection and mrs jennings 
commended her in her heart for being so honest 
they then talked on for a few minutes longer without her 
catching a syllable when another lucky stop in marianne s 
performance brought her these words in the colonel s calm voice 
i am afraid it cannot take place very soon 
astonished and shocked at so unlover like a speech 
she was almost ready to cry out lord what should 
hinder it but checking her desire confined herself 
to this silent ejaculation 
this is very strange sure he need not wait to be older 
this delay on the colonel s side however did not 
seem to offend or mortify his fair companion in the least 
for on their breaking up the conference soon afterwards 
and moving different ways mrs jennings very plainly heard 
elinor say and with a voice which shewed her to feel what she said 
i shall always think myself very much obliged to you 
mrs jennings was delighted with her gratitude 
and only wondered that after hearing such a sentence 
the colonel should be able to take leave of them as he 
immediately did with the utmost sang froid and go away 
without making her any reply she had not thought her old 
friend could have made so indifferent a suitor 
what had really passed between them was to this effect 
i have heard said he with great compassion 
of the injustice your friend mr ferrars has suffered 
from his family for if i understand the matter right 
he has been entirely cast off by them for persevering 
in his engagement with a very deserving young woman 
have i been rightly informed is it so 
elinor told him that it was 
the cruelty the impolitic cruelty he replied 
with great feeling of dividing or attempting to divide 
two young people long attached to each other is terrible 
mrs ferrars does not know what she may be doing what 
she may drive her son to i have seen mr ferrars two 
or three times in harley street and am much pleased 
with him he is not a young man with whom one can 
be intimately acquainted in a short time but i have 
seen enough of him to wish him well for his own sake 
and as a friend of yours i wish it still more 
i understand that he intends to take orders will you 
be so good as to tell him that the living of delaford 
now just vacant as i am informed by this day s post 
is his if he think it worth his acceptance but that 
perhaps so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now 
it may be nonsense to appear to doubt i only wish it 
were more valuable it is a rectory but a small one 
the late incumbent i believe did not make more than 
l per annum and though it is certainly capable 
of improvement i fear not to such an amount as 
to afford him a very comfortable income such as it is 
however my pleasure in presenting him to it 
will be very great pray assure him of it 
elinor s astonishment at this commission could 
hardly have been greater had the colonel been really 
making her an offer of his hand the preferment 
which only two days before she had considered as hopeless 
for edward was already provided to enable him to marry 
and she of all people in the world was fixed on to 
bestow it her emotion was such as mrs jennings had 
attributed to a very different because but whatever minor 
feelings less pure less pleasing might have a share 
in that emotion her esteem for the general benevolence 
and her gratitude for the particular friendship 
which together prompted colonel brandon to this act 
were strongly felt and warmly expressed she thanked him 
for it with all her heart spoke of edward s principles and 
disposition with that praise which she knew them to deserve 
and promised to undertake the commission with pleasure 
if it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office 
to another but at the same time she could not help 
thinking that no one could so well perform it as himself 
it was an office in short from which unwilling to give 
edward the pain of receiving an obligation from her 
she would have been very glad to be spared herself 
but colonel brandon on motives of equal delicacy 
declining it likewise still seemed so desirous of its being 
given through her means that she would not on any account 
make farther opposition edward she believed was still in 
town 
and fortunately she had heard his address from miss steele 
she could undertake therefore to inform him of it 
in the course of the day after this had been settled 
colonel brandon began to talk of his own advantage 
in securing so respectable and agreeable a neighbour 
and then it was that he mentioned with regret that the 
house was small and indifferent an evil which elinor 
as mrs jennings had supposed her to do made very light of 
at least as far as regarded its size 
the smallness of the house said she 
i cannot imagine any inconvenience to them 
for it will be in proportion to their family and income 
by which the colonel was surprised to find that she 
was considering mr ferrars s marriage as the certain 
consequence of the presentation for he did not suppose it 
possible that delaford living could supply such an income 
as anybody in his style of life would venture to settle on 
and he said so 
this little rectory can do no more than make mr ferrars 
comfortable as a bachelor it cannot enable him to marry 
i am sorry to say that my patronage ends with this 
and my interest is hardly more extensive if however 
by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve 
him farther i must think very differently of him 
from what i now do if i am not as ready to be useful 
to him then as i sincerely wish i could be at present 
what i am now doing indeed seems nothing at all 
since it can advance him so little towards what must 
be his principal his only object of happiness 
his marriage must still be a distant good at least 
i am afraid it cannot take place very soon 
such was the sentence which when misunderstood 
so justly offended the delicate feelings of mrs jennings 
but after this narration of what really passed between 
colonel brandon and elinor while they stood at the window 
the gratitude expressed by the latter on their parting may 
perhaps appear in general not less reasonably excited 
nor less properly worded than if it had arisen from 
an offer of marriage 
chapter 
well miss dashwood said mrs jennings 
sagaciously smiling as soon as the gentleman had withdrawn 
i do not ask you what the colonel has been saying to you 
for though upon my honour i tried to keep out of hearing 
i could not help catching enough to understand his business 
and i assure you i never was better pleased in my life 
and i wish you joy of it with all my heart 
thank you madam said elinor it is a matter 
of great joy to me and i feel the goodness of colonel 
brandon most sensibly there are not many men who would 
act as he has done few people who have so compassionate 
a heart i never was more astonished in my life 
lord my dear you are very modest i an t the least 
astonished at it in the world for i have often thought 
of late there was nothing more likely to happen 
you judged from your knowledge of the colonel s 
general benevolence but at least you could not foresee 
that the opportunity would so very soon occur 
opportunity repeated mrs jennings oh as to that 
when a man has once made up his mind to such a thing 
somehow or other he will soon find an opportunity 
well my dear i wish you joy of it again and again 
and if ever there was a happy couple in the world i think 
i shall soon know where to look for them 
you mean to go to delaford after them i suppose 
said elinor with a faint smile 
aye my dear that i do indeed and as to the house 
being a bad one i do not know what the colonel would be at 
for it is as good a one as ever i saw 
he spoke of its being out of repair 
well and whose fault is that why do not he repair it 
who should do it but himself 
they were interrupted by the servant s coming in to 
announce the carriage being at the door and mrs jennings 
immediately preparing to go said 
well my dear i must be gone before i have had half 
my talk out but however we may have it all over in 
the evening for we shall be quite alone i do not ask 
you to go with me for i dare say your mind is too full 
of the matter to care for company and besides you must 
long to tell your sister all about it 
marianne had left the room before the conversation began 
certainly madam i shall tell marianne of it 
but i shall not mention it at present to any body else 
oh very well said mrs jennings rather disappointed 
then you would not have me tell it to lucy for i think 
of going as far as holborn to day 
no madam not even lucy if you please 
one day s delay will not be very material and till i 
have written to mr ferrars i think it ought not to be 
mentioned to any body else i shall do that directly 
it is of importance that no time should be lost with him 
for he will of course have much to do relative to 
his ordination 
this speech at first puzzled mrs jennings exceedingly 
why mr ferrars was to have been written to about it 
in such a hurry she could not immediately comprehend 
a few moments reflection however produced a very happy idea 
and she exclaimed 
oh ho i understand you mr ferrars is to be 
the man well so much the better for him ay to be sure 
he must be ordained in readiness and i am very glad 
to find things are so forward between you but my dear 
is not this rather out of character should not the colonel 
write himself sure he is the proper person 
elinor did not quite understand the beginning of 
mrs jennings s speech neither did she think it worth 
inquiring into and therefore only replied to its conclusion 
colonel brandon is so delicate a man that he rather 
wished any one to announce his intentions to mr ferrars 
than himself 
and so you are forced to do it well that is an odd 
kind of delicacy however i will not disturb you seeing 
her preparing to write you know your own concerns best 
so goodby my dear i have not heard of any thing to 
please me so well since charlotte was brought to bed 
and away she went but returning again in a moment 
i have just been thinking of betty s sister my dear 
i should be very glad to get her so good a mistress 
but whether she would do for a lady s maid i am sure i 
cannot tell she is an excellent housemaid and works 
very well at her needle however you will think of all 
that at your leisure 
certainly madam replied elinor not hearing 
much of what she said and more anxious to be alone 
than to be mistress of the subject 
how she should begin how she should express 
herself in her note to edward was now all her concern 
the particular circumstances between them made 
a difficulty of that which to any other person would 
have been the easiest thing in the world but she 
equally feared to say too much or too little and sat 
deliberating over her paper with the pen in her band 
till broken in on by the entrance of edward himself 
he had met mrs jennings at the door in her way to 
the carriage as he came to leave his farewell card and she 
after apologising for not returning herself had obliged 
him to enter by saying that miss dashwood was above 
and wanted to speak with him on very particular business 
elinor had just been congratulating herself 
in the midst of her perplexity that however difficult it 
might be to express herself properly by letter it was 
at least preferable to giving the information by word 
of mouth when her visitor entered to force her upon this 
greatest exertion of all her astonishment and confusion 
were very great on his so sudden appearance she had 
not seen him before since his engagement became public 
and therefore not since his knowing her to be acquainted 
with it which with the consciousness of what she 
had been thinking of and what she had to tell him 
made her feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes 
he too was much distressed and they sat down together 
in a most promising state of embarrassment whether he 
had asked her pardon for his intrusion on first coming 
into the room he could not recollect but determining 
to be on the safe side he made his apology in form 
as soon as he could say any thing after taking a chair 
mrs jennings told me said he that you wished 
to speak with me at least i understood her so or i 
certainly should not have intruded on you in such a manner 
though at the same time i should have been extremely 
sorry to leave london without seeing you and your sister 
especially as it will most likely be some time it 
is not probable that i should soon have the pleasure 
of meeting you again i go to oxford tomorrow 
you would not have gone however said elinor 
recovering herself and determined to get over what she 
so much dreaded as soon as possible without receiving 
our good wishes even if we had not been able to give them 
in person mrs jennings was quite right in what she said 
i have something of consequence to inform you of 
which i was on the point of communicating by paper 
i am charged with a most agreeable office breathing 
rather faster than usual as she spoke colonel brandon 
who was here only ten minutes ago has desired me to say 
that understanding you mean to take orders he has 
great pleasure in offering you the living of delaford 
now just vacant and only wishes it were more valuable 
allow me to congratulate you on having so respectable 
and well judging a friend and to join in his wish that 
the living it is about two hundred a year were much 
more considerable and such as might better enable you 
to as might be more than a temporary accommodation to 
yourself such in short as might establish all your views 
of happiness 
what edward felt as he could not say it himself 
it cannot be expected that any one else should say for him 
he looked all the astonishment which such unexpected 
such unthought of information could not fail of exciting 
but he said only these two words 
colonel brandon 
yes continued elinor gathering more resolution 
as some of the worst was over colonel brandon means 
it as a testimony of his concern for what has lately 
passed for the cruel situation in which the unjustifiable 
conduct of your family has placed you a concern 
which i am sure marianne myself and all your friends 
must share and likewise as a proof of his high esteem 
for your general character and his particular approbation 
of your behaviour on the present occasion 
colonel brandon give me a living can it be possible 
the unkindness of your own relations has made you 
astonished to find friendship any where 
no replied be with sudden consciousness not to 
find it in you for i cannot be ignorant that to you 
to your goodness i owe it all i feel it i would express 
it if i could but as you well know i am no orator 
you are very much mistaken i do assure you 
that you owe it entirely at least almost entirely 
to your own merit and colonel brandon s discernment 
of it i have had no hand in it i did not even know 
till i understood his design that the living was vacant 
nor had it ever occurred to me that he might have 
had such a living in his gift as a friend of mine 
of my family he may perhaps indeed i know he has 
still greater pleasure in bestowing it but upon my word 
you owe nothing to my solicitation 
truth obliged her to acknowledge some small share 
in the action but she was at the same time so unwilling 
to appear as the benefactress of edward that she acknowledged 
it with hesitation which probably contributed to fix 
that suspicion in his mind which had recently entered it 
for a short time he sat deep in thought after elinor had ceased 
to speak at last and as if it were rather an effort he said 
colonel brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability 
i have always heard him spoken of as such and your brother 
i know esteems him highly he is undoubtedly a sensible man 
and in his manners perfectly the gentleman 
indeed replied elinor i believe that you will find him 
on farther acquaintance all that you have heard him to be 
and as you will be such very near neighbours for i understand 
the parsonage is almost close to the mansion house 
it is particularly important that he should be all this 
edward made no answer but when she had turned 
away her head gave her a look so serious so earnest 
so uncheerful as seemed to say that he might hereafter wish 
the distance between the parsonage and the mansion house 
much greater 
colonel brandon i think lodges in st james street 
said he soon afterwards rising from his chair 
elinor told him the number of the house 
i must hurry away then to give him those thanks 
which you will not allow me to give you to assure him 
that he has made me a very an exceedingly happy man 
elinor did not offer to detain him and they parted 
with a very earnest assurance on her side of her unceasing 
good wishes for his happiness in every change of situation 
that might befall him on his with rather an attempt to 
return the same good will than the power of expressing it 
when i see him again said elinor to herself 
as the door shut him out i shall see him the husband 
of lucy 
and with this pleasing anticipation she sat down 
to reconsider the past recall the words and endeavour 
to comprehend all the feelings of edward and of course 
to reflect on her own with discontent 
when mrs jennings came home though she returned 
from seeing people whom she had never seen before 
and of whom therefore she must have a great deal to say 
her mind was so much more occupied by the important secret 
in her possession than by anything else that she 
reverted to it again as soon as elinor appeared 
well my dear she cried i sent you up to the 
young man did not i do right and i suppose you had 
no great difficulty you did not find him very unwilling 
to accept your proposal 
no madam that was not very likely 
well and how soon will he be ready for it seems 
all to depend upon that 
really said elinor i know so little of these kind 
of forms that i can hardly even conjecture as to the time 
or the preparation necessary but i suppose two or three 
months will complete his ordination 
two or three months cried mrs jennings lord my dear 
how calmly you talk of it and can the colonel wait two 
or three months lord bless me i am sure it would put me 
quite out of patience and though one would be very glad 
to do a kindness by poor mr ferrars i do think it is 
not worth while to wait two or three months for him 
sure somebody else might be found that would do as well 
somebody that is in orders already 
my dear madam said elinor what can you be thinking of 
why colonel brandon s only object is to be of use to mr ferrars 
lord bless you my dear sure you do not mean to persuade 
me that the colonel only marries you for the sake of giving 
ten guineas to mr ferrars 
the deception could not continue after this 
and an explanation immediately took place by which both 
gained considerable amusement for the moment without any 
material loss of happiness to either for mrs jennings 
only exchanged one form of delight for another and still 
without forfeiting her expectation of the first 
aye aye the parsonage is but a small one said she 
after the first ebullition of surprise and satisfaction 
was over and very likely may be out of repair but to hear 
a man apologising as i thought for a house that to my 
knowledge has five sitting rooms on the ground floor and i 
think the housekeeper told me could make up fifteen beds 
and to you too that had been used to live in barton cottage 
it seems quite ridiculous but my dear we must 
touch up the colonel to do some thing to the parsonage 
and make it comfortable for them before lucy goes to it 
but colonel brandon does not seem to have any idea 
of the living s being enough to allow them to marry 
the colonel is a ninny my dear because he has two 
thousand a year himself he thinks that nobody else can marry 
on less take my word for it that if i am alive i shall 
be paying a visit at delaford parsonage before michaelmas 
and i am sure i shall not go if lucy an t there 
elinor was quite of her opinion as to the probability 
of their not waiting for any thing more 
chapter 
edward having carried his thanks to colonel brandon 
proceeded with his happiness to lucy and such was the 
excess of it by the time he reached bartlett s buildings 
that she was able to assure mrs jennings who called 
on her again the next day with her congratulations 
that she had never seen him in such spirits before 
in her life 
her own happiness and her own spirits were at 
least very certain and she joined mrs jennings most 
heartily in her expectation of their being all comfortably 
together in delaford parsonage before michaelmas 
so far was she at the same time from any backwardness 
to give elinor that credit which edward would give her 
that she spoke of her friendship for them both with the most 
grateful warmth was ready to own all their obligation 
to her and openly declared that no exertion for their 
good on miss dashwood s part either present or future 
would ever surprise her for she believed her capable of 
doing any thing in the world for those she really valued 
as for colonel brandon she was not only ready to worship 
him as a saint but was moreover truly anxious that 
he should be treated as one in all worldly concerns 
anxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost 
and scarcely resolved to avail herself at delaford 
as far as she possibly could of his servants his carriage 
his cows and his poultry 
it was now above a week since john dashwood had 
called in berkeley street and as since that time no notice 
had been taken by them of his wife s indisposition 
beyond one verbal enquiry elinor began to feel it 
necessary to pay her a visit this was an obligation 
however which not only opposed her own inclination 
but which had not the assistance of any encouragement 
from her companions marianne not contented with 
absolutely refusing to go herself was very urgent 
to prevent her sister s going at all and mrs jennings 
though her carriage was always at elinor s service 
so very much disliked mrs john dashwood that not even her 
curiosity to see how she looked after the late discovery 
nor her strong desire to affront her by taking edward s part 
could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again 
the consequence was that elinor set out by herself 
to pay a visit for which no one could really have 
less inclination and to run the risk of a tete a tete 
with a woman whom neither of the others had so much 
reason to dislike 
mrs dashwood was denied but before the carriage could 
turn from the house her husband accidentally came out 
he expressed great pleasure in meeting elinor told her 
that he had been just going to call in berkeley street 
and assuring her that fanny would be very glad to see her 
invited her to come in 
they walked up stairs in to the drawing room nobody was there 
fanny is in her own room i suppose said he i 
will go to her presently for i am sure she will not 
have the least objection in the world to seeing you 
very far from it indeed now especially there 
cannot be but however you and marianne were always 
great favourites why would not marianne come 
elinor made what excuse she could for her 
i am not sorry to see you alone he replied 
for i have a good deal to say to you this living 
of colonel brandon s can it be true has he really given 
it to edward i heard it yesterday by chance and was 
coming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it 
it is perfectly true colonel brandon has given 
the living of delaford to edward 
really well this is very astonishing no 
relationship no connection between them and now 
that livings fetch such a price what was the value of this 
about two hundred a year 
very well and for the next presentation to a living 
of that value supposing the late incumbent to have 
been old and sickly and likely to vacate it soon he 
might have got i dare say fourteen hundred pounds 
and how came he not to have settled that matter before this 
person s death now indeed it would be too late to sell it 
but a man of colonel brandon s sense i wonder he should 
be so improvident in a point of such common such natural 
concern well i am convinced that there is a vast deal 
of inconsistency in almost every human character i suppose 
however on recollection that the case may probably be this 
edward is only to hold the living till the person to whom 
the colonel has really sold the presentation is old enough 
to take it aye aye that is the fact depend upon it 
elinor contradicted it however very positively 
and by relating that she had herself been employed 
in conveying the offer from colonel brandon to edward 
and therefore must understand the terms on which it 
was given obliged him to submit to her authority 
it is truly astonishing he cried after hearing 
what she said what could be the colonel s motive 
a very simple one to be of use to mr ferrars 
well well whatever colonel brandon may be 
edward is a very lucky man you will not mention the matter 
to fanny however for though i have broke it to her 
and she bears it vastly well she will not like to hear 
it much talked of 
elinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing 
that she thought fanny might have borne with composure 
an acquisition of wealth to her brother by which neither 
she nor her child could be possibly impoverished 
mrs ferrars added he lowering his voice to the 
tone becoming so important a subject knows nothing 
about it at present and i believe it will be best to 
keep it entirely concealed from her as long as may be 
when the marriage takes place i fear she must hear 
of it all 
but why should such precaution be used though 
it is not to be supposed that mrs ferrars can have 
the smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son has 
money enough to live upon for that must be quite 
out of the question yet why upon her late behaviour 
is she supposed to feel at all she has done with her 
son she cast him off for ever and has made all those 
over whom she had any influence cast him off likewise 
surely after doing so she cannot be imagined liable 
to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account 
she cannot be interested in any thing that befalls him 
she would not be so weak as to throw away the comfort 
of a child and yet retain the anxiety of a parent 
ah elinor said john your reasoning is very good 
but it is founded on ignorance of human nature 
when edward s unhappy match takes place depend upon it 
his mother will feel as much as if she had never discarded him 
and therefore every circumstance that may accelerate that 
dreadful event must be concealed from her as much as possible 
mrs ferrars can never forget that edward is her son 
you surprise me i should think it must nearly 
have escaped her memory by this time 
you wrong her exceedingly mrs ferrars is one 
of the most affectionate mothers in the world 
elinor was silent 
we think now said mr dashwood after a short pause 
of robert s marrying miss morton 
elinor smiling at the grave and decisive importance 
of her brother s tone calmly replied 
the lady i suppose has no choice in the affair 
choice how do you mean 
i only mean that i suppose from your manner 
of speaking it must be the same to miss morton whether 
she marry edward or robert 
certainly there can be no difference for robert 
will now to all intents and purposes be considered 
as the eldest son and as to any thing else they are 
both very agreeable young men i do not know that one 
is superior to the other 
elinor said no more and john was also for a short 
time silent his reflections ended thus 
of one thing my dear sister kindly taking her hand 
and speaking in an awful whisper i may assure you 
and i will do it because i know it must gratify you 
i have good reason to think indeed i have it from the 
best authority or i should not repeat it for otherwise 
it would be very wrong to say any thing about it but 
i have it from the very best authority not that i ever 
precisely heard mrs ferrars say it herself but her 
daughter did and i have it from her that in short 
whatever objections there might be against a certain a 
certain connection you understand me it would have been 
far preferable to her it would not have given her half 
the vexation that this does i was exceedingly pleased 
to hear that mrs ferrars considered it in that light 
a very gratifying circumstance you know to us all 
it would have been beyond comparison she said the least 
evil of the two and she would be glad to compound now 
for nothing worse but however all that is quite out 
of the question not to be thought of or mentioned 
as to any attachment you know it never could be all 
that is gone by but i thought i would just tell you 
of this because i knew how much it must please you 
not that you have any reason to regret my dear elinor there 
is no doubt of your doing exceedingly well quite as well 
or better perhaps all things considered has colonel 
brandon been with you lately 
elinor had heard enough if not to gratify her vanity 
and raise her self importance to agitate her nerves 
and fill her mind and she was therefore glad to be 
spared from the necessity of saying much in reply herself 
and from the danger of hearing any thing more from 
her brother by the entrance of mr robert ferrars 
after a few moments chat john dashwood recollecting that 
fanny was yet uninformed of her sister s being there 
quitted the room in quest of her and elinor was left 
to improve her acquaintance with robert who by the 
gay unconcern the happy self complacency of his manner 
while enjoying so unfair a division of his mother s love 
and liberality to the prejudice of his banished brother 
earned only by his own dissipated course of life and that 
brother s integrity was confirming her most unfavourable 
opinion of his head and heart 
they had scarcely been two minutes by themselves 
before he began to speak of edward for he too had heard 
of the living and was very inquisitive on the subject 
elinor repeated the particulars of it as she had given them 
to john and their effect on robert though very different 
was not less striking than it had been on him he laughed 
most immoderately the idea of edward s being a clergyman 
and living in a small parsonage house diverted him 
beyond measure and when to that was added the fanciful 
imagery of edward reading prayers in a white surplice 
and publishing the banns of marriage between john smith and 
mary brown he could conceive nothing more ridiculous 
elinor while she waited in silence and immovable 
gravity the conclusion of such folly could not restrain 
her eyes from being fixed on him with a look that spoke 
all the contempt it excited it was a look however 
very well bestowed for it relieved her own feelings and gave 
no intelligence to him he was recalled from wit to wisdom 
not by any reproof of her s but by his own sensibility 
we may treat it as a joke said he at last 
recovering from the affected laugh which had considerably 
lengthened out the genuine gaiety of the moment but upon 
my soul it is a most serious business poor edward 
he is ruined for ever i am extremely sorry for it 
for i know him to be a very good hearted creature as 
well meaning a fellow perhaps as any in the world 
you must not judge of him miss dashwood from your 
slight acquaintance poor edward his manners are certainly 
not the happiest in nature but we are not all born 
you know with the same powers the same address 
poor fellow to see him in a circle of strangers 
to be sure it was pitiable enough but upon my soul 
i believe he has as good a heart as any in the kingdom 
and i declare and protest to you i never was so shocked in my 
life as when it all burst forth i could not believe it 
my mother was the first person who told me of it 
and i feeling myself called on to act with resolution 
immediately said to her my dear madam i do not know 
what you may intend to do on the occasion but as for myself 
i must say that if edward does marry this young woman 
i never will see him again that was what i said immediately 
i was most uncommonly shocked indeed poor edward he has 
done for himself completely shut himself out for ever from 
all decent society but as i directly said to my mother 
i am not in the least surprised at it from his style 
of education it was always to be expected my poor mother 
was half frantic 
have you ever seen the lady 
yes once while she was staying in this house 
i happened to drop in for ten minutes and i saw 
quite enough of her the merest awkward country girl 
without style or elegance and almost without beauty 
i remember her perfectly just the kind of girl i 
should suppose likely to captivate poor edward 
i offered immediately as soon as my mother related 
the affair to me to talk to him myself and dissuade 
him from the match but it was too late then i found 
to do any thing for unluckily i was not in the way 
at first and knew nothing of it till after the breach 
had taken place when it was not for me you know 
to interfere but had i been informed of it a few 
hours earlier i think it is most probable that something 
might have been hit on i certainly should have represented 
it to edward in a very strong light my dear fellow 
i should have said consider what you are doing 
you are making a most disgraceful connection and such a one 
as your family are unanimous in disapproving i cannot 
help thinking in short that means might have been found 
but now it is all too late he must be starved you know 
that is certain absolutely starved 
he had just settled this point with great composure 
when the entrance of mrs john dashwood put an end to the 
subject 
but though she never spoke of it out of her own family 
elinor could see its influence on her mind in the something 
like confusion of countenance with which she entered 
and an attempt at cordiality in her behaviour to herself 
she even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find 
that elinor and her sister were so soon to leave town 
as she had hoped to see more of them an exertion 
in which her husband who attended her into the room 
and hung enamoured over her accents seemed to distinguish 
every thing that was most affectionate and graceful 
chapter 
one other short call in harley street in which elinor 
received her brother s congratulations on their travelling 
so far towards barton without any expense and on colonel 
brandon s being to follow them to cleveland in a day or two 
completed the intercourse of the brother and sisters 
in town and a faint invitation from fanny to come 
to norland whenever it should happen to be in their way 
which of all things was the most unlikely to occur 
with a more warm though less public assurance from john 
to elinor of the promptitude with which he should come 
to see her at delaford was all that foretold any meeting 
in the country 
it amused her to observe that all her friends seemed 
determined to send her to delaford a place in which 
of all others she would now least chuse to visit 
or wish to reside for not only was it considered as 
her future home by her brother and mrs jennings but even lucy 
when they parted gave her a pressing invitation to visit her there 
very early in april and tolerably early in the day 
the two parties from hanover square and berkeley street set 
out from their respective homes to meet by appointment 
on the road for the convenience of charlotte and her child 
they were to be more than two days on their journey 
and mr palmer travelling more expeditiously with colonel brandon 
was to join them at cleveland soon after their arrival 
marianne few as had been her hours of comfort 
in london and eager as she had long been to quit it 
could not when it came to the point bid adieu to 
the house in which she had for the last time enjoyed 
those hopes and that confidence in willoughby 
which were now extinguished for ever without great pain 
nor could she leave the place in which willoughby remained 
busy in new engagements and new schemes in which she 
could have no share without shedding many tears 
elinor s satisfaction at the moment of removal 
was more positive she had no such object for her lingering 
thoughts to fix on she left no creature behind from whom 
it would give her a moment s regret to be divided for ever 
she was pleased to be free herself from the persecution 
of lucy s friendship she was grateful for bringing 
her sister away unseen by willoughby since his marriage 
and she looked forward with hope to what a few months 
of tranquility at barton might do towards restoring 
marianne s peace of mind and confirming her own 
their journey was safely performed the second 
day brought them into the cherished or the prohibited 
county of somerset for as such was it dwelt on by turns 
in marianne s imagination and in the forenoon of the third 
they drove up to cleveland 
cleveland was a spacious modern built house 
situated on a sloping lawn it had no park but the 
pleasure grounds were tolerably extensive and like 
every other place of the same degree of importance 
it had its open shrubbery and closer wood walk 
a road of smooth gravel winding round a plantation 
led to the front the lawn was dotted over with timber 
the house itself was under the guardianship of the fir 
the mountain ash and the acacia and a thick screen of 
them altogether interspersed with tall lombardy poplars 
shut out the offices 
marianne entered the house with a heart swelling 
with emotion from the consciousness of being only eighty 
miles from barton and not thirty from combe magna 
and before she had been five minutes within its walls 
while the others were busily helping charlotte to show 
her child to the housekeeper she quitted it again 
stealing away through the winding shrubberies now just 
beginning to be in beauty to gain a distant eminence 
where from its grecian temple her eye wandering over 
a wide tract of country to the south east could fondly 
rest on the farthest ridge of hills in the horizon 
and fancy that from their summits combe magna might be seen 
in such moments of precious invaluable misery 
she rejoiced in tears of agony to be at cleveland 
and as she returned by a different circuit to the house 
feeling all the happy privilege of country liberty 
of wandering from place to place in free and luxurious solitude 
she resolved to spend almost every hour of every day 
while she remained with the palmers in the indulgence of 
such solitary rambles 
she returned just in time to join the others 
as they quitted the house on an excursion through its 
more immediate premises and the rest of the morning was 
easily whiled away in lounging round the kitchen garden 
examining the bloom upon its walls and listening to the 
gardener s lamentations upon blights in dawdling through 
the green house where the loss of her favourite plants 
unwarily exposed and nipped by the lingering frost 
raised the laughter of charlotte and in visiting her 
poultry yard where in the disappointed hopes of her 
dairy maid by hens forsaking their nests or being 
stolen by a fox or in the rapid decrease of a promising 
young brood she found fresh sources of merriment 
the morning was fine and dry and marianne 
in her plan of employment abroad had not calculated 
for any change of weather during their stay at cleveland 
with great surprise therefore did she find herself prevented 
by a settled rain from going out again after dinner 
she had depended on a twilight walk to the grecian temple 
and perhaps all over the grounds and an evening merely 
cold or damp would not have deterred her from it 
but a heavy and settled rain even she could not fancy dry 
or pleasant weather for walking 
their party was small and the hours passed quietly away 
mrs palmer had her child and mrs jennings her carpet work 
they talked of the friends they had left behind 
arranged lady middleton s engagements and wondered 
whether mr palmer and colonel brandon would get farther 
than reading that night elinor however little concerned 
in it joined in their discourse and marianne who had 
the knack of finding her way in every house to the library 
however it might be avoided by the family in general 
soon procured herself a book 
nothing was wanting on mrs palmer s side that constant 
and friendly good humour could do to make them feel 
themselves welcome the openness and heartiness of her 
manner more than atoned for that want of recollection 
and elegance which made her often deficient in the forms 
of politeness her kindness recommended by so pretty 
a face was engaging her folly though evident 
was not disgusting because it was not conceited 
and elinor could have forgiven every thing but her laugh 
the two gentlemen arrived the next day to a very 
late dinner affording a pleasant enlargement of the party 
and a very welcome variety to their conversation which a 
long morning of the same continued rain had reduced very low 
elinor had seen so little of mr palmer and in that 
little had seen so much variety in his address to her 
sister and herself that she knew not what to expect 
to find him in his own family she found him however 
perfectly the gentleman in his behaviour to all his visitors 
and only occasionally rude to his wife and her mother 
she found him very capable of being a pleasant companion 
and only prevented from being so always by too great 
an aptitude to fancy himself as much superior to people 
in general as he must feel himself to be to mrs jennings 
and charlotte for the rest of his character and habits 
they were marked as far as elinor could perceive 
with no traits at all unusual in his sex and time of life 
he was nice in his eating uncertain in his hours 
fond of his child though affecting to slight it 
and idled away the mornings at billiards which ought 
to have been devoted to business she liked him however 
upon the whole much better than she had expected and in 
her heart was not sorry that she could like him no more 
not sorry to be driven by the observation of his epicurism 
his selfishness and his conceit to rest with complacency 
on the remembrance of edward s generous temper simple taste 
and diffident feelings 
of edward or at least of some of his concerns 
she now received intelligence from colonel brandon 
who had been into dorsetshire lately and who 
treating her at once as the disinterested friend 
of mr ferrars and the kind of confidant of himself 
talked to her a great deal of the parsonage at delaford 
described its deficiencies and told her what he meant 
to do himself towards removing them his behaviour 
to her in this as well as in every other particular 
his open pleasure in meeting her after an absence 
of only ten days his readiness to converse with her 
and his deference for her opinion might very well 
justify mrs jennings s persuasion of his attachment 
and would have been enough perhaps had not elinor still 
as from the first believed marianne his real favourite 
to make her suspect it herself but as it was 
such a notion had scarcely ever entered her head 
except by mrs jennings s suggestion and she could 
not help believing herself the nicest observer of the 
two she watched his eyes while mrs jennings thought 
only of his behaviour and while his looks of anxious 
solicitude on marianne s feeling in her head and throat 
the beginning of a heavy cold because unexpressed by words 
entirely escaped the latter lady s observation she could 
discover in them the quick feelings and needless alarm 
of a lover 
two delighful twilight walks on the third and fourth 
evenings of her being there not merely on the dry gravel 
of the shrubbery but all over the grounds and especially 
in the most distant parts of them where there was something 
more of wildness than in the rest where the trees were 
the oldest and the grass was the longest and wettest 
had assisted by the still greater imprudence of sitting 
in her wet shoes and stockings given marianne a cold 
so violent as though for a day or two trifled with 
or denied would force itself by increasing ailments on 
the concern of every body and the notice of herself 
prescriptions poured in from all quarters and as usual 
were all declined though heavy and feverish with a pain 
in her limbs and a cough and a sore throat a good night s 
rest was to cure her entirely and it was with difficulty 
that elinor prevailed on her when she went to bed 
to try one or two of the simplest of the remedies 
chapter 
marianne got up the next morning at her usual time 
to every inquiry replied that she was better and tried to 
prove herself so by engaging in her accustomary employments 
but a day spent in sitting shivering over the fire 
with a book in her hand which she was unable to read 
or in lying weary and languid on a sofa did not speak 
much in favour of her amendment and when at last 
she went early to bed more and more indisposed colonel 
brandon was only astonished at her sister s composure 
who though attending and nursing her the whole day 
against marianne inclination and forcing proper medicines 
on her at night trusted like marianne to the certainty 
and efficacy of sleep and felt no real alarm 
a very restless and feverish night however 
disappointed the expectation of both and when marianne 
after persisting in rising confessed herself unable 
to sit up and returned voluntarily to her bed 
elinor was very ready to adopt mrs jennings s advice 
of sending for the palmers apothecary 
he came examined his patient and though encouraging 
miss dashwood to expect that a very few days would restore 
her sister to health yet by pronouncing her disorder 
to have a putrid tendency and allowing the word infection 
to pass his lips gave instant alarm to mrs palmer 
on her baby s account mrs jennings who had been inclined 
from the first to think marianne s complaint more serious 
than elinor now looked very grave on mr harris s report 
and confirming charlotte s fears and caution urged the 
necessity of her immediate removal with her infant 
and mr palmer though treating their apprehensions as idle 
found the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great 
to be withstood her departure therefore was fixed on 
and within an hour after mr harris s arrival she set off 
with her little boy and his nurse for the house of a 
near relation of mr palmer s who lived a few miles 
on the other side of bath whither her husband promised 
at her earnest entreaty to join her in a day or two 
and whither she was almost equally urgent with her 
mother to accompany her mrs jennings however with a 
kindness of heart which made elinor really love her 
declared her resolution of not stirring from cleveland 
as long as marianne remained ill and of endeavouring 
by her own attentive care to supply to her the place 
of the mother she had taken her from and elinor found her 
on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate 
desirous to share in all her fatigues and often by her 
better experience in nursing of material use 
poor marianne languid and low from the nature 
of her malady and feeling herself universally ill 
could no longer hope that tomorrow would find her recovered 
and the idea of what tomorrow would have produced 
but for this unlucky illness made every ailment severe 
for on that day they were to have begun their journey home 
and attended the whole way by a servant of mrs jennings 
were to have taken their mother by surprise on the 
following forenoon the little she said was all in 
lamentation of this inevitable delay though elinor tried 
to raise her spirits and make her believe as she then 
really believed herself that it would be a very short one 
the next day produced little or no alteration in the 
state of the patient she certainly was not better and 
except that there was no amendment did not appear worse 
their party was now farther reduced for mr palmer 
though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity 
and good nature as from a dislike of appearing to be 
frightened away by his wife was persuaded at last 
by colonel brandon to perform his promise of following her 
and while he was preparing to go colonel brandon himself 
with a much greater exertion began to talk of going 
likewise here however the kindness of mrs jennings 
interposed most acceptably for to send the colonel away 
while his love was in so much uneasiness on her sister s 
account would be to deprive them both she thought 
of every comfort and therefore telling him at once 
that his stay at cleveland was necessary to herself 
that she should want him to play at piquet of an evening 
while miss dashwood was above with her sister c she 
urged him so strongly to remain that he who was gratifying 
the first wish of his own heart by a compliance could not 
long even affect to demur especially as mrs jennings s 
entreaty was warmly seconded by mr palmer who seemed 
to feel a relief to himself in leaving behind him a person 
so well able to assist or advise miss dashwood in any emergence 
marianne was of course kept in ignorance of all 
these arrangements she knew not that she had been 
the means of sending the owners of cleveland away 
in about seven days from the time of their arrival 
it gave her no surprise that she saw nothing 
of mrs palmer and as it gave her likewise no concern 
she never mentioned her name 
two days passed away from the time of mr palmer s departure 
and her situation continued with little variation 
the same mr harris who attended her every day 
still talked boldly of a speedy recovery and miss dashwood 
was equally sanguine but the expectation of the others 
was by no means so cheerful mrs jennings had determined 
very early in the seizure that marianne would never 
get over it and colonel brandon who was chiefly 
of use in listening to mrs jennings s forebodings 
was not in a state of mind to resist their influence 
he tried to reason himself out of fears which the different 
judgment of the apothecary seemed to render absurd 
but the many hours of each day in which he was left 
entirely alone were but too favourable for the admission 
of every melancholy idea and he could not expel from 
his mind the persuasion that he should see marianne no more 
on the morning of the third day however the gloomy 
anticipations of both were almost done away for when 
mr harris arrived he declared his patient materially better 
her pulse was much stronger and every symptom more favourable 
than on the preceding visit elinor confirmed in every 
pleasant hope was all cheerfulness rejoicing that 
in her letters to her mother she had pursued her own 
judgment rather than her friend s in making very light 
of the indisposition which delayed them at cleveland 
and almost fixing on the time when marianne would be 
able to travel 
but the day did not close so auspiciously as it began 
towards the evening marianne became ill again growing 
more heavy restless and uncomfortable than before 
her sister however still sanguine was willing to 
attribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue 
of having sat up to have her bed made and carefully 
administering the cordials prescribed saw her with 
satisfaction sink at last into a slumber from which 
she expected the most beneficial effects her sleep 
though not so quiet as elinor wished to see it 
lasted a considerable time and anxious to observe 
the result of it herself she resolved to sit with her 
during the whole of it mrs jennings knowing nothing 
of any change in the patient went unusually early to bed 
her maid who was one of the principal nurses was recreating 
herself in the housekeeper s room and elinor remained 
alone with marianne 
the repose of the latter became more and more disturbed 
and her sister who watched with unremitting attention 
her continual change of posture and heard the frequent 
but inarticulate sounds of complaint which passed her lips 
was almost wishing to rouse her from so painful a slumber 
when marianne suddenly awakened by some accidental noise 
in the house started hastily up and with feverish wildness 
cried out 
is mama coming 
not yet cried the other concealing her terror 
and assisting marianne to lie down again but she will 
be here i hope before it is long it is a great way 
you know from hence to barton 
but she must not go round by london cried marianne 
in the same hurried manner i shall never see her 
if she goes by london 
elinor perceived with alarm that she was not 
quite herself and while attempting to soothe her 
eagerly felt her pulse it was lower and quicker than ever 
and marianne still talking wildly of mama her alarm 
increased so rapidly as to determine her on sending 
instantly for mr harris and despatching a messenger 
to barton for her mother to consult with colonel brandon 
on the best means of effecting the latter was a thought 
which immediately followed the resolution of its performance 
and as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place 
by her sister she hastened down to the drawing room 
where she knew he was generally to be found at a much 
later hour than the present 
it was no time for hesitation her fears and her 
difficulties were immediately before him her fears 
he had no courage no confidence to attempt the removal of 
he listened to them in silent despondence but her 
difficulties were instantly obviated for with a readiness 
that seemed to speak the occasion and the service 
pre arranged in his mind he offered himself as the 
messenger who should fetch mrs dashwood elinor made no 
resistance that was not easily overcome she thanked him 
with brief though fervent gratitude and while he went 
to hurry off his servant with a message to mr harris and 
an order for post horses directly she wrote a few lines 
to her mother 
the comfort of such a friend at that moment as colonel 
brandon or such a companion for her mother how gratefully 
was it felt a companion whose judgment would guide 
whose attendance must relieve and whose friendship might 
soothe her as far as the shock of such a summons could 
be lessened to her his presence his manners his assistance 
would lessen it 
he meanwhile whatever he might feel acted with all 
the firmness of a collected mind made every necessary 
arrangement with the utmost despatch and calculated 
with exactness the time in which she might look for 
his return not a moment was lost in delay of any kind 
the horses arrived even before they were expected 
and colonel brandon only pressing her hand with a look 
of solemnity and a few words spoken too low to reach her ear 
hurried into the carriage it was then about twelve 
of the clock and she returned to her sister s apartment to wait 
for the arrival of the apothecary and to watch by her 
the rest of the night it was a night of almost equal 
suffering to both hour after hour passed away in sleepless 
pain and delirium on marianne s side and in the most 
cruel anxiety on elinor s before mr harris appeared 
her apprehensions once raised paid by their excess for all 
her former security and the servant who sat up with her 
for she would not allow mrs jennings to be called 
only tortured her more by hints of what her mistress 
had always thought 
marianne s ideas were still at intervals 
fixed incoherently on her mother and whenever she 
mentioned her name it gave a pang to the heart of 
poor elinor who reproaching herself for having trifled 
with so many days of illness and wretched for some 
immediate relief fancied that all relief might soon 
be in vain that every thing had been delayed too long 
and pictured to herself her suffering mother arriving 
too late to see this darling child or to see her rational 
she was on the point of sending again for mr harris 
or if he could not come for some other advice 
when the former but not till after five of the clock arrived 
his opinion however made some little amends for his delay 
for though acknowledging a very unexpected and unpleasant 
alteration in his patient he would not allow the danger 
to be material and talked of the relief which a fresh 
mode of treatment must procure with a confidence which 
in a lesser degree was communicated to elinor he promised 
to call again in the course of three or four hours 
and left both the patient and her anxious attendant more 
composed than he had found them 
with strong concern and with many reproaches for not 
being called to their aid did mrs jennings hear in the 
morning of what had passed her former apprehensions 
now with greater reason restored left her no doubt of 
the event and though trying to speak comfort to elinor 
her conviction of her sister s danger would not allow her 
to offer the comfort of hope her heart was really grieved 
the rapid decay the early death of a girl so young 
so lovely as marianne must have struck a less interested 
person with concern on mrs jennings s compassion 
she had other claims she had been for three months 
her companion was still under her care and she was 
known to have been greatly injured and long unhappy 
the distress of her sister too particularly a favourite 
was before her and as for their mother when mrs jennings 
considered that marianne might probably be to her what 
charlotte was to herself her sympathy in her sufferings 
was very sincere 
mr harris was punctual in his second visit 
but he came to be disappointed in his hopes of what the 
last would produce his medicines had failed the fever 
was unabated and marianne only more quiet not more 
herself remained in a heavy stupor elinor catching all 
and more than all his fears in a moment proposed to call 
in further advice but he judged it unnecessary he had 
still something more to try some more fresh application 
of whose success he was as confident as the last and his 
visit concluded with encouraging assurances which reached 
the ear but could not enter the heart of miss dashwood 
she was calm except when she thought of her mother 
but she was almost hopeless and in this state she continued 
till noon scarcely stirring from her sister s bed 
her thoughts wandering from one image of grief 
one suffering friend to another and her spirits oppressed 
to the utmost by the conversation of mrs jennings 
who scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger 
of this attack to the many weeks of previous indisposition 
which marianne s disappointment had brought on 
elinor felt all the reasonableness of the idea and it 
gave fresh misery to her reflections 
about noon however she began but with a caution a 
dread of disappointment which for some time kept her silent 
even to her friend to fancy to hope she could perceive 
a slight amendment in her sister s pulse she waited 
watched and examined it again and again and at last 
with an agitation more difficult to bury under exterior calmness 
than all her foregoing distress ventured to communicate 
her hopes mrs jennings though forced on examination 
to acknowledge a temporary revival tried to keep her 
young friend from indulging a thought of its continuance 
and elinor conning over every injunction of distrust 
told herself likewise not to hope but it was too late 
hope had already entered and feeling all its anxious flutter 
she bent over her sister to watch she hardly knew for what 
half an hour passed away and the favourable symptom 
yet blessed her others even arose to confirm it 
her breath her skin her lips all flattered elinor 
with signs of amendment and marianne fixed her eyes on 
her with a rational though languid gaze anxiety and 
hope now oppressed her in equal degrees and left her no 
moment of tranquillity till the arrival of mr harris at 
four of the clock when his assurances his felicitations on 
a recovery in her sister even surpassing his expectation 
gave her confidence comfort and tears of joy 
marianne was in every respect materially better 
and he declared her entirely out of danger mrs jennings 
perhaps satisfied with the partial justification of her 
forebodings which had been found in their late alarm 
allowed herself to trust in his judgment and admitted 
with unfeigned joy and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness 
the probability of an entire recovery 
elinor could not be cheerful her joy was of a 
different kind and led to any thing rather than to gaiety 
marianne restored to life health friends and to her 
doting mother was an idea to fill her heart with sensations 
of exquisite comfort and expand it in fervent gratitude 
but it lead to no outward demonstrations of joy no words 
no smiles all within elinor s breast was satisfaction 
silent and strong 
she continued by the side of her sister with little 
intermission the whole afternoon calming every fear 
satisfying every inquiry of her enfeebled spirits 
supplying every succour and watching almost every look and 
every breath the possibility of a relapse would of course 
in some moments occur to remind her of what anxiety was 
but when she saw on her frequent and minute examination 
that every symptom of recovery continued and saw marianne 
at six of the clock sink into a quiet steady and to all 
appearance comfortable sleep she silenced every doubt 
the time was now drawing on when colonel brandon 
might be expected back at ten of the clock she trusted 
or at least not much later her mother would be relieved 
from the dreadful suspense in which she must now be 
travelling towards them the colonel too perhaps scarcely 
less an object of pity oh how slow was the progress 
of time which yet kept them in ignorance 
at seven of the clock leaving marianne still sweetly asleep 
she joined mrs jennings in the drawing room to tea 
of breakfast she had been kept by her fears and of 
dinner by their sudden reverse from eating much 
and the present refreshment therefore with such feelings 
of content as she brought to it was particularly welcome 
mrs jennings would have persuaded her at its conclusion 
to take some rest before her mother s arrival and allow her to 
take her place by marianne but elinor had no sense of fatigue 
no capability of sleep at that moment about her and she was 
not to be kept away from her sister an unnecessary instant 
mrs jennings therefore attending her up stairs into the 
sick chamber to satisfy herself that all continued right 
left her there again to her charge and her thoughts 
and retired to her own room to write letters and sleep 
the night was cold and stormy the wind roared 
round the house and the rain beat against the windows 
but elinor all happiness within regarded it not 
marianne slept through every blast and the travellers 
they had a rich reward in store for every present inconvenience 
the clock struck eight had it been ten 
elinor would have been convinced that at that moment 
she heard a carriage driving up to the house 
and so strong was the persuasion that she did in spite 
of the almost impossibility of their being already come 
that she moved into the adjoining dressing closet and 
opened a window shutter to be satisfied of the truth 
she instantly saw that her ears had not deceived her 
the flaring lamps of a carriage were immediately in view 
by their uncertain light she thought she could discern it 
to be drawn by four horses and this while it told the 
excess of her poor mother s alarm gave some explanation 
to such unexpected rapidity 
never in her life had elinor found it so difficult 
to be calm as at that moment the knowledge of what her 
mother must be feeling as the carriage stopt at the door 
of her doubt her dread perhaps her despair and 
of what she had to tell with such knowledge it was 
impossible to be calm all that remained to be done 
was to be speedy and therefore staying only till 
she could leave mrs jennings s maid with her sister 
she hurried down stairs 
the bustle in the vestibule as she passed along 
an inner lobby assured her that they were already 
in the house she rushed to the drawing room she 
entered it and saw only willoughby 
chapter 
elinor starting back with a look of horror at 
the sight of him obeyed the first impulse of her heart 
in turning instantly to quit the room and her hand 
was already on the lock when its action was suspended 
by his hastily advancing and saying in a voice rather 
of command than supplication 
miss dashwood for half an hour for ten minutes 
i entreat you to stay 
no sir she replied with firmness i shall not stay 
your business cannot be with me the servants i suppose 
forgot to tell you that mr palmer was not in the house 
had they told me he cried with vehemence 
that mr palmer and all his relations were at the devil 
it would not have turned me from the door my business 
is with you and only you 
with me in the utmost amazement well sir 
be quick and if you can less violent 
sit down and i will be both 
she hesitated she knew not what to do the possibility 
of colonel brandon s arriving and finding her there 
came across her but she had promised to hear him 
and her curiosity no less than her honor was engaged 
after a moment s recollection therefore concluding that 
prudence required dispatch and that her acquiescence would 
best promote it she walked silently towards the table 
and sat down he took the opposite chair and for half 
a minute not a word was said by either 
pray be quick sir said elinor impatiently 
i have no time to spare 
he was sitting in an attitude of deep meditation 
and seemed not to hear her 
your sister said he with abruptness a moment 
afterwards is out of danger i heard it from the servant 
god be praised but is it true is it really true 
elinor would not speak he repeated the inquiry with 
yet greater eagerness 
for god s sake tell me is she out of danger or is she not 
we hope she is 
he rose up and walked across the room 
had i known as much half an hour ago but 
since i am here speaking with a forced vivacity as he 
returned to his seat what does it signify for once 
miss dashwood it will be the last time perhaps let us 
be cheerful together i am in a fine mood for gaiety 
tell me honestly a deeper glow overspreading his cheeks 
do you think me most a knave or a fool 
elinor looked at him with greater astonishment than ever 
she began to think that be must be in liquor the 
strangeness of such a visit and of such manners 
seemed no otherwise intelligible and with this impression 
she immediately rose saying 
mr willoughby i advise you at present to return 
to combe i am not at leisure to remain with you longer 
whatever your business may be with me will it be better 
recollected and explained to morrow 
i understand you he replied with an expressive smile 
and a voice perfectly calm yes i am very drunk 
a pint of porter with my cold beef at marlborough was 
enough to over set me 
at marlborough cried elinor more and more at 
a loss to understand what he would be at 
yes i left london this morning at eight of the clock 
and the only ten minutes i have spent out of my chaise 
since that time procured me a nuncheon at marlborough 
the steadiness of his manner and the intelligence 
of his eye as he spoke convincing elinor that whatever 
other unpardonable folly might bring him to cleveland 
he was not brought there by intoxication she said 
after a moment s recollection 
mr willoughby you ought to feel and i certainly 
do that after what has passed your coming here in 
this manner and forcing yourself upon my notice 
requires a very particular excuse what is it 
that you mean by it 
i mean said he with serious energy if i can 
to make you hate me one degree less than you do now 
i mean to offer some kind of explanation some kind 
of apology for the past to open my whole heart to you 
and by convincing you that though i have been always 
a blockhead i have not been always a rascal to obtain 
something like forgiveness from ma from your sister 
is this the real reason of your coming 
upon my soul it is was his answer with a warmth 
which brought all the former willoughby to her remembrance 
and in spite of herself made her think him sincere 
if that is all you may be satisfied already 
for marianne does she has long forgiven you 
has she he cried in the same eager tone 
then she has forgiven me before she ought to have done it 
but she shall forgive me again and on more reasonable 
grounds now will you listen to me 
elinor bowed her assent 
i do not know said he after a pause of expectation 
on her side and thoughtfulness on his own how you 
may have accounted for my behaviour to your sister 
or what diabolical motive you may have imputed to me 
perhaps you will hardly think the better of me it is 
worth the trial however and you shall hear every thing 
when i first became intimate in your family i had no 
other intention no other view in the acquaintance 
than to pass my time pleasantly while i was obliged to remain 
in devonshire more pleasantly than i had ever done before 
your sister s lovely person and interesting manners 
could not but please me and her behaviour to me almost 
from the first was of a kind it is astonishing 
when i reflect on what it was and what she was that my 
heart should have been so insensible but at first 
i must confess my vanity only was elevated by it 
careless of her happiness thinking only of my own amusement 
giving way to feelings which i had always been too much 
in the habit of indulging i endeavoured by every means 
in my power to make myself pleasing to her without any 
design of returning her affection 
miss dashwood at this point turning her eyes on him 
with the most angry contempt stopped him by saying 
it is hardly worth while mr willoughby 
for you to relate or for me to listen any longer 
such a beginning as this cannot be followed by any thing 
do not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on 
the subject 
i insist on you hearing the whole of it he replied 
my fortune was never large and i had always been expensive 
always in the habit of associating with people of better 
income than myself every year since my coming of age 
or even before i believe had added to my debts and though 
the death of my old cousin mrs smith was to set me free 
yet that event being uncertain and possibly far distant 
it had been for some time my intention to re establish my 
circumstances by marrying a woman of fortune to attach 
myself to your sister therefore was not a thing to be 
thought of and with a meanness selfishness cruelty 
which no indignant no contemptuous look even of yours 
miss dashwood can ever reprobate too much i was acting 
in this manner trying to engage her regard without a 
thought of returning it but one thing may be said 
for me even in that horrid state of selfish vanity 
i did not know the extent of the injury i meditated 
because i did not then know what it was to love 
but have i ever known it well may it be doubted for had i 
really loved could i have sacrificed my feelings to vanity 
to avarice or what is more could i have sacrificed hers 
but i have done it to avoid a comparative poverty 
which her affection and her society would have deprived 
of all its horrors i have by raising myself to affluence 
lost every thing that could make it a blessing 
you did then said elinor a little softened 
believe yourself at one time attached to her 
to have resisted such attractions to have withstood 
such tenderness is there a man on earth who could have 
done it yes i found myself by insensible degrees 
sincerely fond of her and the happiest hours of my life 
were what i spent with her when i felt my intentions 
were strictly honourable and my feelings blameless 
even then however when fully determined on paying 
my addresses to her i allowed myself most improperly 
to put off from day to day the moment of doing it 
from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement 
while my circumstances were so greatly embarrassed 
i will not reason here nor will i stop for you to expatiate 
on the absurdity and the worse than absurdity of scrupling 
to engage my faith where my honour was already bound 
the event has proved that i was a cunning fool 
providing with great circumspection for a possible 
opportunity of making myself contemptible and wretched 
for ever at last however my resolution was taken 
and i had determined as soon as i could engage her alone 
to justify the attentions i had so invariably paid her 
and openly assure her of an affection which i had already 
taken such pains to display but in the interim in the 
interim of the very few hours that were to pass before i 
could have an opportunity of speaking with her in private 
a circumstance occurred an unlucky circumstance to ruin 
all my resolution and with it all my comfort a discovery 
took place here he hesitated and looked down mrs smith 
had somehow or other been informed i imagine by some 
distant relation whose interest it was to deprive me of 
her favour of an affair a connection but i need not 
explain myself farther he added looking at her with an 
heightened colour and an enquiring eye your particular 
intimacy you have probably heard the whole story long ago 
i have returned elinor colouring likewise 
and hardening her heart anew against any compassion for him 
i have heard it all and how you will explain away any 
part of your guilt in that dreadful business i confess 
is beyond my comprehension 
remember cried willoughby from whom you received 
the account could it be an impartial one i acknowledge 
that her situation and her character ought to have been 
respected by me i do not mean to justify myself but at 
the same time cannot leave you to suppose that i have nothing 
to urge that because she was injured she was irreproachable 
and because i was a libertine she must be a saint 
if the violence of her passions the weakness of her 
understanding i do not mean however to defend myself 
her affection for me deserved better treatment and i often 
with great self reproach recall the tenderness which 
for a very short time had the power of creating any return 
i wish i heartily wish it had never been but i have injured 
more than herself and i have injured one whose affection 
for me may i say it was scarcely less warm than hers 
and whose mind oh how infinitely superior 
your indifference however towards that unfortunate 
girl i must say it unpleasant to me as the discussion 
of such a subject may well be your indifference is no 
apology for your cruel neglect of her do not think yourself 
excused by any weakness any natural defect of understanding 
on her side in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours 
you must have known that while you were enjoying yourself 
in devonshire pursuing fresh schemes always gay 
always happy she was reduced to the extremest indigence 
but upon my soul i did not know it he warmly 
replied i did not recollect that i had omitted to give 
her my direction and common sense might have told her 
how to find it out 
well sir and what said mrs smith 
she taxed me with the offence at once and my confusion 
may be guessed the purity of her life the formality 
of her notions her ignorance of the world every thing 
was against me the matter itself i could not deny 
and vain was every endeavour to soften it she was 
previously disposed i believe to doubt the morality of my 
conduct in general and was moreover discontented with 
the very little attention the very little portion of my 
time that i had bestowed on her in my present visit 
in short it ended in a total breach by one measure i 
might have saved myself in the height of her morality 
good woman she offered to forgive the past if i would 
marry eliza that could not be and i was formally 
dismissed from her favour and her house the night 
following this affair i was to go the next morning 
was spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct 
should be the struggle was great but it ended too soon 
my affection for marianne my thorough conviction of her 
attachment to me it was all insufficient to outweigh 
that dread of poverty or get the better of those false 
ideas of the necessity of riches which i was naturally 
inclined to feel and expensive society had increased 
i had reason to believe myself secure of my present wife 
if i chose to address her and i persuaded myself to think 
that nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do 
a heavy scene however awaited me before i could leave 
devonshire i was engaged to dine with you on that very day 
some apology was therefore necessary for my breaking 
this engagement but whether i should write this apology 
or deliver it in person was a point of long debate 
to see marianne i felt would be dreadful and i even doubted 
whether i could see her again and keep to my resolution 
in that point however i undervalued my own magnanimity 
as the event declared for i went i saw her and saw 
her miserable and left her miserable and left her hoping 
never to see her again 
why did you call mr willoughby said elinor 
reproachfully a note would have answered every purpose 
why was it necessary to call 
it was necessary to my own pride i could not bear 
to leave the country in a manner that might lead you 
or the rest of the neighbourhood to suspect any part 
of what had really passed between mrs smith and myself 
and i resolved therefore on calling at the cottage 
in my way to honiton the sight of your dear sister 
however was really dreadful and to heighten the matter 
i found her alone you were all gone i do not know where 
i had left her only the evening before so fully 
so firmly resolved within my self on doing right 
a few hours were to have engaged her to me for ever 
and i remember how happy how gay were my spirits as i 
walked from the cottage to allenham satisfied with myself 
delighted with every body but in this our last interview 
of friendship i approached her with a sense of guilt 
that almost took from me the power of dissembling 
her sorrow her disappointment her deep regret when i told 
her that i was obliged to leave devonshire so immediately i 
never shall forget it united too with such reliance 
such confidence in me oh god what a hard hearted 
rascal i was 
they were both silent for a few moments 
elinor first spoke 
did you tell her that you should soon return 
i do not know what i told her he replied impatiently 
less than was due to the past beyond a doubt and in all 
likelihood much more than was justified by the future 
i cannot think of it it will not do then came your dear mother 
to torture me farther with all her kindness and confidence 
thank heaven it did torture me i was miserable 
miss dashwood you cannot have an idea of the comfort it 
gives me to look back on my own misery i owe such a grudge 
to myself for the stupid rascally folly of my own heart 
that all my past sufferings under it are only triumph and 
exultation to me now well i went left all that i loved 
and went to those to whom at best i was only indifferent 
my journey to town travelling with my own horses 
and therefore so tediously no creature to speak to my 
own reflections so cheerful when i looked forward 
every thing so inviting when i looked back at barton 
the picture so soothing oh it was a blessed journey 
he stopped 
well sir said elinor who though pitying him 
grew impatient for his departure and this is all 
ah no have you forgot what passed in town 
that infamous letter did she shew it you 
yes i saw every note that passed 
when the first of hers reached me as it immediately did 
for i was in town the whole time what i felt is 
in the common phrase not to be expressed in a more 
simple one perhaps too simple to raise any emotion 
my feelings were very very painful every line every word 
was in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer 
were she here would forbid a dagger to my heart 
to know that marianne was in town was in the same language 
a thunderbolt thunderbolts and daggers what a reproof 
would she have given me her taste her opinions i believe 
they are better known to me than my own and i am sure 
they are dearer 
elinor s heart which had undergone many changes 
in the course of this extraordinary conversation 
was now softened again yet she felt it her duty to check 
such ideas in her companion as the last 
this is not right mr willoughby remember that 
you are married relate only what in your conscience 
you think necessary for me to hear 
marianne s note by assuring me that i was still 
as dear to her as in former days that in spite of the many 
many weeks we had been separated she was as constant 
in her own feelings and as full of faith in the constancy 
of mine as ever awakened all my remorse i say awakened 
because time and london business and dissipation 
had in some measure quieted it and i had been growing 
a fine hardened villain fancying myself indifferent to her 
and chusing to fancy that she too must have become 
indifferent to me talking to myself of our past attachment 
as a mere idle trifling business shrugging up my shoulders 
in proof of its being so and silencing every reproach 
overcoming every scruple by secretly saying now and then 
i shall be heartily glad to hear she is well married 
but this note made me know myself better i felt that 
she was infinitely dearer to me than any other woman 
in the world and that i was using her infamously 
but every thing was then just settled between miss grey 
and me to retreat was impossible all that i had to do 
was to avoid you both i sent no answer to marianne 
intending by that to preserve myself from her farther notice 
and for some time i was even determined not to call in 
berkeley street but at last judging it wiser to affect 
the air of a cool common acquaintance than anything else 
i watched you all safely out of the house one morning 
and left my name 
watched us out of the house 
even so you would be surprised to hear how often 
i watched you how often i was on the point of falling 
in with you i have entered many a shop to avoid your sight 
as the carriage drove by lodging as i did in bond street 
there was hardly a day in which i did not catch a glimpse 
of one or other of you and nothing but the most constant 
watchfulness on my side a most invariably prevailing 
desire to keep out of your sight could have separated us 
so long i avoided the middletons as much as possible 
as well as everybody else who was likely to prove 
an acquaintance in common not aware of their being 
in town however i blundered on sir john i believe 
the first day of his coming and the day after i had called 
at mrs jennings s he asked me to a party a dance at his 
house in the evening had he not told me as an inducement 
that you and your sister were to be there i should have 
felt it too certain a thing to trust myself near him 
the next morning brought another short note from marianne 
still affectionate open artless confiding everything 
that could make my conduct most hateful i could not 
answer it i tried but could not frame a sentence 
but i thought of her i believe every moment of the day 
if you can pity me miss dashwood pity my situation as it 
was then with my head and heart full of your sister 
i was forced to play the happy lover to another woman those 
three or four weeks were worse than all well at last 
as i need not tell you you were forced on me and what a 
sweet figure i cut what an evening of agony it was 
marianne beautiful as an angel on one side calling me 
willoughby in such a tone oh god holding out her hand 
to me asking me for an explanation with those bewitching 
eyes fixed in such speaking solicitude on my face and 
sophia jealous as the devil on the other hand looking 
all that was well it does not signify it is over now 
such an evening i ran away from you all as soon as i could 
but not before i had seen marianne s sweet face as white 
as death that was the last last look i ever had of her 
the last manner in which she appeared to me it was a horrid 
sight yet when i thought of her to day as really dying 
it was a kind of comfort to me to imagine that i knew 
exactly how she would appear to those who saw her last 
in this world she was before me constantly before me 
as i travelled in the same look and hue 
a short pause of mutual thoughtfulness succeeded 
willoughby first rousing himself broke it thus 
well let me make haste and be gone your sister 
is certainly better certainly out of danger 
we are assured of it 
your poor mother too doting on marianne 
but the letter mr willoughby your own letter 
have you any thing to say about that 
yes yes that in particular your sister 
wrote to me again you know the very next morning 
you saw what she said i was breakfasting at the 
ellisons and her letter with some others was brought 
to me there from my lodgings it happened to catch 
sophia s eye before it caught mine and its size 
the elegance of the paper the hand writing altogether 
immediately gave her a suspicion some vague report had 
reached her before of my attachment to some young lady 
in devonshire and what had passed within her observation 
the preceding evening had marked who the young lady was 
and made her more jealous than ever affecting that air 
of playfulness therefore which is delightful in a woman 
one loves she opened the letter directly and read 
its contents she was well paid for her impudence 
she read what made her wretched her wretchedness i could 
have borne but her passion her malice at all events it 
must be appeased and in short what do you think of my 
wife s style of letter writing delicate tender 
truly feminine was it not 
your wife the letter was in your own hand writing 
yes but i had only the credit of servilely copying 
such sentences as i was ashamed to put my name to 
the original was all her own her own happy thoughts 
and gentle diction but what could i do we were engaged 
every thing in preparation the day almost fixed but i am 
talking like a fool preparation day in honest words 
her money was necessary to me and in a situation like 
mine any thing was to be done to prevent a rupture 
and after all what did it signify to my character 
in the opinion of marianne and her friends in what language 
my answer was couched it must have been only to one end 
my business was to declare myself a scoundrel and whether 
i did it with a bow or a bluster was of little importance 
i am ruined for ever in their opinion said i to 
myself i am shut out for ever from their society 
they already think me an unprincipled fellow this letter 
will only make them think me a blackguard one such were 
my reasonings as in a sort of desperate carelessness 
i copied my wife s words and parted with the last relics 
of marianne her three notes unluckily they were all 
in my pocketbook or i should have denied their existence 
and hoarded them for ever i was forced to put them up 
and could not even kiss them and the lock of hair that too 
i had always carried about me in the same pocket book 
which was now searched by madam with the most ingratiating 
virulence the dear lock all every memento was torn from me 
you are very wrong mr willoughby very blamable 
said elinor while her voice in spite of herself 
betrayed her compassionate emotion you ought not to speak 
in this way either of mrs willoughby or my sister 
you had made your own choice it was not forced on you 
your wife has a claim to your politeness to your respect 
at least she must be attached to you or she would not 
have married you to treat her with unkindness to speak 
of her slightingly is no atonement to marianne nor can i 
suppose it a relief to your own conscience 
do not talk to me of my wife said he with a heavy sigh 
she does not deserve your compassion she knew i had no 
regard for her when we married well married we were 
and came down to combe magna to be happy and afterwards 
returned to town to be gay and now do you pity me 
miss dashwood or have i said all this to no purpose 
am i be it only one degree am i less guilty in your opinion 
than i was before my intentions were not always wrong 
have i explained away any part of my guilt 
yes you have certainly removed something a little 
you have proved yourself on the whole less faulty than 
i had believed you you have proved your heart less wicked 
much less wicked but i hardly know the misery that 
you have inflicted i hardly know what could have made 
it worse 
will you repeat to your sister when she is recovered 
what i have been telling you let me be a little lightened 
too in her opinion as well as in yours you tell me that 
she has forgiven me already let me be able to fancy that 
a better knowledge of my heart and of my present feelings 
will draw from her a more spontaneous more natural more 
gentle less dignified forgiveness tell her of my misery 
and my penitence tell her that my heart was never inconstant 
to her and if you will that at this moment she is dearer 
to me than ever 
i will tell her all that is necessary to what may 
comparatively be called your justification but you have 
not explained to me the particular reason of your coming now 
nor how you heard of her illness 
last night in drury lane lobby i ran against sir 
john middleton and when he saw who i was for the first 
time these two months he spoke to me that he had cut 
me ever since my marriage i had seen without surprise 
or resentment now however his good natured honest 
stupid soul full of indignation against me and concern 
for your sister could not resist the temptation of telling 
me what he knew ought to though probably he did not 
think it would vex me horridly as bluntly as he could 
speak it therefore he told me that marianne dashwood 
was dying of a putrid fever at cleveland a letter that 
morning received from mrs jennings declared her danger 
most imminent the palmers are all gone off in a fright 
c i was too much shocked to be able to pass myself 
off as insensible even to the undiscerning sir john 
his heart was softened in seeing mine suffer and so much 
of his ill will was done away that when we parted 
he almost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an 
old promise about a pointer puppy what i felt on hearing 
that your sister was dying and dying too believing me 
the greatest villain upon earth scorning hating me 
in her latest moments for how could i tell what horrid 
projects might not have been imputed one person i 
was sure would represent me as capable of any thing 
what i felt was dreadful my resolution was soon made 
and at eight of the clock this morning i was in my carriage 
now you know all 
elinor made no answer her thoughts were silently fixed 
on the irreparable injury which too early an independence 
and its consequent habits of idleness dissipation and luxury 
had made in the mind the character the happiness 
of a man who to every advantage of person and talents 
united a disposition naturally open and honest and a 
feeling affectionate temper the world had made him 
extravagant and vain extravagance and vanity had made him 
cold hearted and selfish vanity while seeking its own 
guilty triumph at the expense of another had involved 
him in a real attachment which extravagance or at least 
its offspring necessity had required to be sacrificed 
each faulty propensity in leading him to evil had led 
him likewise to punishment the attachment from which 
against honour against feeling against every better interest 
he had outwardly torn himself now when no longer allowable 
governed every thought and the connection for the sake 
of which he had with little scruple left her sister 
to misery was likely to prove a source of unhappiness 
to himself of a far more incurable nature from a reverie 
of this kind she was recalled at the end of some minutes 
by willoughby who rousing himself from a reverie at least 
equally painful started up in preparation for going and said 
there is no use in staying here i must be off 
are you going back to town 
no to combe magna i have business there 
from thence to town in a day or two good bye 
he held out his hand she could not refuse to give 
him hers s he pressed it with affection 
and you do think something better of me than 
you did said he letting it fall and leaning against 
the mantel piece as if forgetting he was to go 
elinor assured him that she did that she forgave 
pitied wished him well was even interested in his 
happiness and added some gentle counsel as to the behaviour 
most likely to promote it his answer was not very encouraging 
as to that said he i must rub through the world 
as well as i can domestic happiness is out of the question 
if however i am allowed to think that you and yours feel 
an interest in my fate and actions it may be the means it 
may put me on my guard at least it may be something to 
live for marianne to be sure is lost to me for ever 
were i even by any blessed chance at liberty again 
elinor stopped him with a reproof 
well he replied once more good bye i shall 
now go away and live in dread of one event 
what do you mean 
your sister s marriage 
you are very wrong she can never be more lost 
to you than she is now 
but she will be gained by some one else and if 
that some one should be the very he whom of all others 
i could least bear but i will not stay to rob myself 
of all your compassionate goodwill by shewing 
that where i have most injured i can least forgive 
good bye god bless you 
and with these words he almost ran out of the room 
chapter 
elinor for some time after he left her for some time 
even after the sound of his carriage had died away remained 
too much oppressed by a crowd of ideas widely differing in 
themselves but of which sadness was the general result 
to think even of her sister 
willoughby he whom only half an hour ago she had 
abhorred as the most worthless of men willoughby in spite 
of all his faults excited a degree of commiseration 
for the sufferings produced by them which made her 
think of him as now separated for ever from her family 
with a tenderness a regret rather in proportion as she 
soon acknowledged within herself to his wishes than to 
his merits she felt that his influence over her mind 
was heightened by circumstances which ought not in reason 
to have weight by that person of uncommon attraction 
that open affectionate and lively manner which it 
was no merit to possess and by that still ardent love 
for marianne which it was not even innocent to indulge 
but she felt that it was so long long before she could 
feel his influence less 
when at last she returned to the unconscious marianne 
she found her just awaking refreshed by so long and sweet 
a sleep to the extent of her hopes elinor s heart was full 
the past the present the future willoughby s visit 
marianne s safety and her mother s expected arrival 
threw her altogether into an agitation of spirits 
which kept off every indication of fatigue and made 
her only fearful of betraying herself to her sister 
short was the time however in which that fear could 
affect her for within half an hour after willoughby s 
leaving the house she was again called down stairs 
by the sound of another carriage eager to save her 
mother from every unnecessary moment s horrible suspense 
she ran immediately into the hall and reached the outward 
door just in time to receive and support her as she entered it 
mrs dashwood whose terror as they drew near the 
house had produced almost the conviction of marianne s 
being no more had no voice to inquire after her 
no voice even for elinor but she waiting neither for 
salutation nor inquiry instantly gave the joyful relief 
and her mother catching it with all her usual warmth 
was in a moment as much overcome by her happiness as she 
had been before by her fears she was supported into 
the drawing room between her daughter and her friend 
and there shedding tears of joy though still unable 
to speak embraced elinor again and again turning from her 
at intervals to press colonel brandon s hand with a look 
which spoke at once her gratitude and her conviction 
of his sharing with herself in the bliss of the moment 
he shared it however in a silence even greater than her own 
as soon as mrs dashwood had recovered herself 
to see marianne was her first desire and in two minutes she 
was with her beloved child rendered dearer to her than ever 
by absence unhappiness and danger elinor s delight 
as she saw what each felt in the meeting was only checked 
by an apprehension of its robbing marianne of farther sleep 
but mrs dashwood could be calm could be even prudent 
when the life of a child was at stake and marianne 
satisfied in knowing her mother was near her and conscious 
of being too weak for conversation submitted readily to the 
silence and quiet prescribed by every nurse around her 
mrs dashwood would sit up with her all night and elinor 
in compliance with her mother s entreaty went to bed 
but the rest which one night entirely sleepless 
and many hours of the most wearing anxiety seemed to 
make requisite was kept off by irritation of spirits 
willoughby poor willoughby as she now allowed 
herself to call him was constantly in her thoughts she 
would not but have heard his vindication for the world 
and now blamed now acquitted herself for having judged him 
so harshly before but her promise of relating it to her 
sister was invariably painful she dreaded the performance 
of it dreaded what its effect on marianne might be 
doubted whether after such an explanation she could ever 
be happy with another and for a moment wished willoughby 
a widower then remembering colonel brandon reproved herself 
felt that to his sufferings and his constancy far more 
than to his rival s the reward of her sister was due 
and wished any thing rather than mrs willoughby s death 
the shock of colonel brandon s errand at barton had been 
much softened to mrs dashwood by her own previous alarm 
for so great was her uneasiness about marianne that she 
had already determined to set out for cleveland on that 
very day without waiting for any further intelligence 
and had so far settled her journey before his arrival 
that the careys were then expected every moment to fetch 
margaret away as her mother was unwilling to take her 
where there might be infection 
marianne continued to mend every day and the brilliant 
cheerfulness of mrs dashwood s looks and spirits proved 
her to be as she repeatedly declared herself one of 
the happiest women in the world elinor could not hear 
the declaration nor witness its proofs without sometimes 
wondering whether her mother ever recollected edward 
but mrs dashwood trusting to the temperate account 
of her own disappointment which elinor had sent her 
was led away by the exuberance of her joy to think only 
of what would increase it marianne was restored to her 
from a danger in which as she now began to feel 
her own mistaken judgment in encouraging the unfortunate 
attachment to willoughby had contributed to place her 
and in her recovery she had yet another source of joy 
unthought of by elinor it was thus imparted to her 
as soon as any opportunity of private conference 
between them occurred 
at last we are alone my elinor you do not yet 
know all my happiness colonel brandon loves marianne 
he has told me so himself 
her daughter feeling by turns both pleased and pained 
surprised and not surprised was all silent attention 
you are never like me dear elinor or i should 
wonder at your composure now had i sat down to wish 
for any possible good to my family i should have fixed 
on colonel brandon s marrying one of you as the object 
most desirable and i believe marianne will be the most 
happy with him of the two 
elinor was half inclined to ask her reason for thinking so 
because satisfied that none founded on an impartial 
consideration of their age characters or feelings 
could be given but her mother must always be carried 
away by her imagination on any interesting subject 
and therefore instead of an inquiry she passed it off with a 
smile 
he opened his whole heart to me yesterday as we travelled 
it came out quite unawares quite undesignedly i you may 
well believe could talk of nothing but my child he could 
not conceal his distress i saw that it equalled my own 
and he perhaps thinking that mere friendship as the world 
now goes would not justify so warm a sympathy or rather 
not thinking at all i suppose giving way to irresistible 
feelings made me acquainted with his earnest tender constant 
affection for marianne he has loved her my elinor ever since 
the first moment of seeing her 
here however elinor perceived not the language 
not the professions of colonel brandon but the natural 
embellishments of her mother s active fancy which fashioned 
every thing delightful to her as it chose 
his regard for her infinitely surpassing anything 
that willoughby ever felt or feigned as much more warm 
as more sincere or constant which ever we are to call it 
has subsisted through all the knowledge of dear marianne s 
unhappy prepossession for that worthless young man and 
without selfishness without encouraging a hope could 
he have seen her happy with another such a noble mind 
such openness such sincerity no one can be deceived 
in him 
colonel brandon s character said elinor 
as an excellent man is well established 
i know it is replied her mother seriously or 
after such a warning i should be the last to encourage 
such affection or even to be pleased by it but his coming 
for me as he did with such active such ready friendship 
is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men 
his character however answered elinor does not rest 
on one act of kindness to which his affection for marianne 
were humanity out of the case would have prompted him 
to mrs jennings to the middletons he has been long 
and intimately known they equally love and respect him 
and even my own knowledge of him though lately acquired 
is very considerable and so highly do i value and esteem him 
that if marianne can be happy with him i shall be as ready 
as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing 
to us in the world what answer did you give him did you 
allow him to hope 
oh my love i could not then talk of hope to him 
or to myself marianne might at that moment be dying 
but he did not ask for hope or encouragement his was 
an involuntary confidence an irrepressible effusion 
to a soothing friend not an application to a parent 
yet after a time i did say for at first i was quite 
overcome that if she lived as i trusted she might 
my greatest happiness would lie in promoting their marriage 
and since our arrival since our delightful security 
i have repeated it to him more fully have given him every 
encouragement in my power time a very little time 
i tell him will do everything marianne s heart is 
not to be wasted for ever on such a man as willoughby 
his own merits must soon secure it 
to judge from the colonel s spirits however 
you have not yet made him equally sanguine 
no he thinks marianne s affection too deeply 
rooted for any change in it under a great length of time 
and even supposing her heart again free is too diffident 
of himself to believe that with such a difference of age 
and disposition he could ever attach her there however 
he is quite mistaken his age is only so much beyond 
hers as to be an advantage as to make his character and 
principles fixed and his disposition i am well convinced 
is exactly the very one to make your sister happy 
and his person his manners too are all in his favour 
my partiality does not blind me he certainly is not 
so handsome as willoughby but at the same time 
there is something much more pleasing in his countenance 
there was always a something if you remember in willoughby s 
eyes at times which i did not like 
elinor could not remember it but her mother 
without waiting for her assent continued 
and his manners the colonel s manners are not only 
more pleasing to me than willoughby s ever were but they 
are of a kind i well know to be more solidly attaching 
to marianne their gentleness their genuine attention 
to other people and their manly unstudied simplicity 
is much more accordant with her real disposition than 
the liveliness often artificial and often ill timed 
of the other i am very sure myself that had willoughby 
turned out as really amiable as he has proved himself 
the contrary marianne would yet never have been so happy 
with him as she will be with colonel brandon 
she paused her daughter could not quite agree 
with her but her dissent was not heard and therefore 
gave no offence 
at delaford she will be within an easy distance of me 
added mrs dashwood even if i remain at barton and in all 
probability for i hear it is a large village indeed there 
certainly must be some small house or cottage close by 
that would suit us quite as well as our present situation 
poor elinor here was a new scheme for getting 
her to delaford but her spirit was stubborn 
his fortune too for at my time of life you know 
everybody cares about that and though i neither know 
nor desire to know what it really is i am sure it must be 
a good one 
here they were interrupted by the entrance of a 
third person and elinor withdrew to think it all over 
in private to wish success to her friend and yet 
in wishing it to feel a pang for willoughby 
chapter 
marianne s illness though weakening in its kind 
had not been long enough to make her recovery slow 
and with youth natural strength and her mother s presence 
in aid it proceeded so smoothly as to enable her to remove 
within four days after the arrival of the latter 
into mrs palmer s dressing room when there at her own 
particular request for she was impatient to pour forth 
her thanks to him for fetching her mother colonel brandon 
was invited to visit her 
his emotion on entering the room in seeing her altered 
looks and in receiving the pale hand which she immediately 
held out to him was such as in elinor s conjecture 
must arise from something more than his affection for marianne 
or the consciousness of its being known to others 
and she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying 
complexion as he looked at her sister the probable 
recurrence of many past scenes of misery to his mind 
brought back by that resemblance between marianne and eliza 
already acknowledged and now strengthened by the hollow eye 
the sickly skin the posture of reclining weakness 
and the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation 
mrs dashwood not less watchful of what passed than 
her daughter but with a mind very differently influenced 
and therefore watching to very different effect 
saw nothing in the colonel s behaviour but what arose 
from the most simple and self evident sensations while in 
the actions and words of marianne she persuaded herself 
to think that something more than gratitude already dawned 
at the end of another day or two marianne growing 
visibly stronger every twelve hours mrs dashwood 
urged equally by her own and her daughter s wishes 
began to talk of removing to barton on her measures 
depended those of her two friends mrs jennings could 
not quit cleveland during the dashwoods stay and colonel 
brandon was soon brought by their united request 
to consider his own abode there as equally determinate 
if not equally indispensable at his and mrs jennings s 
united request in return mrs dashwood was prevailed 
on to accept the use of his carriage on her journey back 
for the better accommodation of her sick child and the colonel 
at the joint invitation of mrs dashwood and mrs jennings 
whose active good nature made her friendly and hospitable 
for other people as well as herself engaged with pleasure 
to redeem it by a visit at the cottage in the course 
of a few weeks 
the day of separation and departure arrived 
and marianne after taking so particular and lengthened 
a leave of mrs jennings one so earnestly grateful so full 
of respect and kind wishes as seemed due to her own heart 
from a secret acknowledgment of past inattention and bidding 
colonel brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend 
was carefully assisted by him into the carriage of which he 
seemed anxious that she should engross at least half 
mrs dashwood and elinor then followed and the others 
were left by themselves to talk of the travellers 
and feel their own dullness till mrs jennings was summoned 
to her chaise to take comfort in the gossip of her maid 
for the loss of her two young companions and colonel brandon 
immediately afterwards took his solitary way to delaford 
the dashwoods were two days on the road and marianne 
bore her journey on both without essential fatigue 
every thing that the most zealous affection the most 
solicitous care could do to render her comfortable 
was the office of each watchful companion and each 
found their reward in her bodily ease and her calmness 
of spirits to elinor the observation of the latter 
was particularly grateful she who had seen her week 
after week so constantly suffering oppressed by anguish 
of heart which she had neither courage to speak of 
nor fortitude to conceal now saw with a joy which no other 
could equally share an apparent composure of mind which 
in being the result as she trusted of serious reflection 
must eventually lead her to contentment and cheerfulness 
as they approached barton indeed and entered 
on scenes of which every field and every tree brought 
some peculiar some painful recollection she grew silent 
and thoughtful and turning away her face from their notice 
sat earnestly gazing through the window but here 
elinor could neither wonder nor blame and when she saw 
as she assisted marianne from the carriage that she 
had been crying she saw only an emotion too natural 
in itself to raise any thing less tender than pity 
and in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise in the 
whole of her subsequent manner she traced the direction 
of a mind awakened to reasonable exertion for no sooner 
had they entered their common sitting room than marianne 
turned her eyes around it with a look of resolute firmness 
as if determined at once to accustom herself to the sight 
of every object with which the remembrance of willoughby could 
be connected she said little but every sentence aimed 
at cheerfulness and though a sigh sometimes escaped her 
it never passed away without the atonement of a smile 
after dinner she would try her piano forte she went to it 
but the music on which her eye first rested was an opera 
procured for her by willoughby containing some of their 
favourite duets and bearing on its outward leaf her own name 
in his hand writing that would not do she shook her head 
put the music aside and after running over the keys 
for a minute complained of feebleness in her fingers 
and closed the instrument again declaring however with firmness 
as she did so that she should in future practice much 
the next morning produced no abatement in these 
happy symptoms on the contrary with a mind and body 
alike strengthened by rest she looked and spoke with 
more genuine spirit anticipating the pleasure of 
margaret s return and talking of the dear family party 
which would then be restored of their mutual pursuits 
and cheerful society as the only happiness worth a wish 
when the weather is settled and i have recovered 
my strength said she we will take long walks together 
every day we will walk to the farm at the edge of the down 
and see how the children go on we will walk to sir john s 
new plantations at barton cross and the abbeyland 
and we will often go the old ruins of the priory 
and try to trace its foundations as far as we are told 
they once reached i know we shall be happy i know 
the summer will pass happily away i mean never to be 
later in rising than six and from that time till dinner 
i shall divide every moment between music and reading 
i have formed my plan and am determined to enter on a course 
of serious study our own library is too well known to me 
to be resorted to for any thing beyond mere amusement 
but there are many works well worth reading at the park 
and there are others of more modern production which i 
know i can borrow of colonel brandon by reading only six 
hours a day i shall gain in the course of a twelve month 
a great deal of instruction which i now feel myself to want 
elinor honoured her for a plan which originated 
so nobly as this though smiling to see the same eager 
fancy which had been leading her to the extreme of languid 
indolence and selfish repining now at work in introducing 
excess into a scheme of such rational employment and virtuous 
self control her smile however changed to a sigh when she 
remembered that promise to willoughby was yet unfulfilled 
and feared she had that to communicate which might again 
unsettle the mind of marianne and ruin at least for a time 
this fair prospect of busy tranquillity willing therefore 
to delay the evil hour she resolved to wait till her 
sister s health were more secure before she appointed it 
but the resolution was made only to be broken 
marianne had been two or three days at home before 
the weather was fine enough for an invalid like herself 
to venture out but at last a soft genial morning appeared 
such as might tempt the daughter s wishes and the 
mother s confidence and marianne leaning on elinor s arm 
was authorised to walk as long as she could without fatigue 
in the lane before the house 
the sisters set out at a pace slow as the feebleness 
of marianne in an exercise hitherto untried since her 
illness required and they had advanced only so far 
beyond the house as to admit a full view of the hill 
the important hill behind when pausing with her eyes 
turned towards it marianne calmly said 
there exactly there pointing with one hand 
on that projecting mound there i fell and there 
i first saw willoughby 
her voice sunk with the word but presently reviving she added 
i am thankful to find that i can look with so little pain 
on the spot shall we ever talk on that subject elinor 
hesitatingly it was said or will it be wrong i can talk 
of it now i hope as i ought to do 
elinor tenderly invited her to be open 
as for regret said marianne i have done with that 
as far as he is concerned i do not mean to talk to you 
of what my feelings have been for him but what they 
are now at present if i could be satisfied on one point 
if i could be allowed to think that he was not always 
acting a part not always deceiving me but above all 
if i could be assured that he never was so very wicked 
as my fears have sometimes fancied him since the story 
of that unfortunate girl 
she stopt elinor joyfully treasured her words 
as she answered 
if you could be assured of that you think you 
should be easy 
yes my peace of mind is doubly involved in it 
for not only is it horrible to suspect a person who has 
been what he has been to me of such designs but what must 
it make me appear to myself what in a situation like mine 
but a most shamefully unguarded affection could expose 
me to 
how then asked her sister would you account 
for his behaviour 
i would suppose him oh how gladly would i suppose him 
only fickle very very fickle 
elinor said no more she was debating within herself 
on the eligibility of beginning her story directly 
or postponing it till marianne were in stronger health 
and they crept on for a few minutes in silence 
i am not wishing him too much good said marianne 
at last with a sigh when i wish his secret reflections 
may be no more unpleasant than my own he will suffer 
enough in them 
do you compare your conduct with his 
no i compare it with what it ought to have been 
i compare it with yours 
our situations have borne little resemblance 
they have borne more than our conduct do not 
my dearest elinor let your kindness defend what i know 
your judgment must censure my illness has made me think 
it has given me leisure and calmness for serious recollection 
long before i was enough recovered to talk i was perfectly 
able to reflect i considered the past i saw in my 
own behaviour since the beginning of our acquaintance 
with him last autumn nothing but a series of imprudence 
towards myself and want of kindness to others 
i saw that my own feelings had prepared my sufferings 
and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led 
me to the grave my illness i well knew had been 
entirely brought on by myself by such negligence of my 
own health as i had felt even at the time to be wrong 
had i died it would have been self destruction i 
did not know my danger till the danger was removed 
but with such feelings as these reflections gave me 
i wonder at my recovery wonder that the very eagerness 
of my desire to live to have time for atonement to my god 
and to you all did not kill me at once had i died 
in what peculiar misery should i have left you my nurse 
my friend my sister you who had seen all the fretful 
selfishness of my latter days who had known all the 
murmurings of my heart how should i have lived in your 
remembrance my mother too how could you have consoled 
her i cannot express my own abhorrence of myself 
whenever i looked towards the past i saw some duty neglected 
or some failing indulged every body seemed injured by me 
the kindness the unceasing kindness of mrs jennings 
i had repaid with ungrateful contempt to the middletons 
to the palmers the steeles to every common acquaintance even 
i had been insolent and unjust with a heart hardened 
against their merits and a temper irritated by their 
very attention to john to fanny yes even to them 
little as they deserve i had given less than their due 
but you you above all above my mother had been wronged 
by me i and only i knew your heart and its sorrows 
yet to what did it influence me not to any compassion 
that could benefit you or myself your example was 
before me but to what avail was i more considerate 
of you and your comfort did i imitate your forbearance 
or lessen your restraints by taking any part in those 
offices of general complaisance or particular gratitude 
which you had hitherto been left to discharge alone no 
not less when i knew you to be unhappy than when i 
had believed you at ease did i turn away from every 
exertion of duty or friendship scarcely allowing sorrow 
to exist but with me regretting only that heart 
which had deserted and wronged me and leaving you 
for or i professed an unbounded affection to be miserable 
for my sake 
here ceased the rapid flow of her self reproving spirit 
and elinor impatient to soothe though too honest 
to flatter gave her instantly that praise and support 
which her frankness and her contrition so well deserved 
marianne pressed her hand and replied 
you are very good the future must be my proof 
i have laid down my plan and if i am capable of adhering 
to it my feelings shall be governed and my temper improved 
they shall no longer worry others nor torture myself 
i shall now live solely for my family you my mother 
and margaret must henceforth be all the world to me 
you will share my affections entirely between you 
from you from my home i shall never again have the smallest 
incitement to move and if i do mix in other society 
it will be only to shew that my spirit is humbled 
my heart amended and that i can practise the civilities 
the lesser duties of life with gentleness and forbearance 
as for willoughby to say that i shall soon or that i shall 
ever forget him would be idle his remembrance can be overcome 
by no change of circumstances or opinions but it shall 
be regulated it shall be checked by religion by reason 
by constant employment 
she paused and added in a low voice if i could 
but know his heart everything would become easy 
elinor who had now been for some time reflecting 
on the propriety or impropriety of speedily hazarding 
her narration without feeling at all nearer decision than 
at first heard this and perceiving that as reflection 
did nothing resolution must do all soon found herself 
leading to the fact 
she managed the recital as she hoped with address 
prepared her anxious listener with caution related simply 
and honestly the chief points on which willoughby 
grounded his apology did justice to his repentance 
and softened only his protestations of present regard 
marianne said not a word she trembled her eyes 
were fixed on the ground and her lips became whiter 
than even sickness had left them a thousand inquiries 
sprung up from her heart but she dared not urge one 
she caught every syllable with panting eagerness her hand 
unknowingly to herself closely pressed her sister s and 
tears covered her cheeks 
elinor dreading her being tired led her towards home 
and till they reached the door of the cottage 
easily conjecturing what her curiosity must be 
though no question was suffered to speak it talked of 
nothing but willoughby and their conversation together 
and was carefully minute in every particular of speech 
and look where minuteness could be safely indulged 
as soon as they entered the house marianne with a kiss 
of gratitude and these two words just articulate through 
her tears tell mama withdrew from her sister and 
walked slowly up stairs elinor would not attempt 
to disturb a solitude so reasonable as what she now sought 
and with a mind anxiously pre arranging its result 
and a resolution of reviving the subject again 
should marianne fail to do it she turned into the parlour 
to fulfill her parting injunction 
chapter 
mrs dashwood did not hear unmoved the vindication 
of her former favourite she rejoiced in his being 
cleared from some part of his imputed guilt she was 
sorry for him she wished him happy but the feelings 
of the past could not be recalled nothing could restore 
him with a faith unbroken a character unblemished 
to marianne nothing could do away the knowledge 
of what the latter had suffered through his means 
nor remove the guilt of his conduct towards eliza 
nothing could replace him therefore in her former esteem 
nor injure the interests of colonel brandon 
had mrs dashwood like her daughter heard willoughby s 
story from himself had she witnessed his distress 
and been under the influence of his countenance and his 
manner it is probable that her compassion would have 
been greater but it was neither in elinor s power 
nor in her wish to rouse such feelings in another by her 
retailed explanation as had at first been called forth 
in herself reflection had given calmness to her judgment 
and sobered her own opinion of willoughby s deserts 
she wished therefore to declare only the simple truth 
and lay open such facts as were really due to his character 
without any embellishment of tenderness to lead the 
fancy astray 
in the evening when they were all three together 
marianne began voluntarily to speak of him again 
but that it was not without an effort the restless 
unquiet thoughtfulness in which she had been for some time 
previously sitting her rising colour as she spoke 
and her unsteady voice plainly shewed 
i wish to assure you both said she that i see 
every thing as you can desire me to do 
mrs dashwood would have interrupted her instantly 
with soothing tenderness had not elinor who really wished 
to hear her sister s unbiased opinion by an eager sign 
engaged her silence marianne slowly continued 
it is a great relief to me what elinor told 
me this morning i have now heard exactly what i 
wished to hear for some moments her voice was lost 
but recovering herself she added and with greater 
calmness than before i am now perfectly satisfied 
i wish for no change i never could have been happy 
with him after knowing as sooner or later i must 
have known all this i should have had no confidence 
no esteem nothing could have done it away to my feelings 
i know it i know it cried her mother 
happy with a man of libertine practices with one 
who so injured the peace of the dearest of our friends 
and the best of men no my marianne has not a heart 
to be made happy with such a man her conscience her 
sensitive conscience would have felt all that the 
conscience of her husband ought to have felt 
marianne sighed and repeated i wish for no change 
you consider the matter said elinor exactly as 
a good mind and a sound understanding must consider it 
and i dare say you perceive as well as myself not only 
in this but in many other circumstances reason enough 
to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you 
in many certain troubles and disappointments in which 
you would have been poorly supported by an affection 
on his side much less certain had you married 
you must have been always poor his expensiveness is 
acknowledged even by himself and his whole conduct declares 
that self denial is a word hardly understood by him 
his demands and your inexperience together on a small 
very small income must have brought on distresses which 
would not be the less grievous to you from having been 
entirely unknown and unthought of before your sense 
of honour and honesty would have led you i know 
when aware of your situation to attempt all the economy 
that would appear to you possible and perhaps as long 
as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort 
you might have been suffered to practice it but beyond that 
and how little could the utmost of your single management 
do to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage 
beyond that had you endeavoured however reasonably 
to abridge his enjoyments is it not to be feared that instead 
of prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent to it 
you would have lessened your own influence on his heart 
and made him regret the connection which had involved him 
in such difficulties 
marianne s lips quivered and she repeated the word 
selfish in a tone that implied do you really think 
him selfish 
the whole of his behaviour replied elinor 
from the beginning to the end of the affair has been 
grounded on selfishness it was selfishness which first 
made him sport with your affections which afterwards 
when his own were engaged made him delay the confession 
of it and which finally carried him from barton 
his own enjoyment or his own ease was in every particular 
his ruling principle 
it is very true my happiness never was his object 
at present continued elinor he regrets what he 
has done and why does he regret it because he finds 
it has not answered towards himself it has not made 
him happy his circumstances are now unembarrassed he 
suffers from no evil of that kind and he thinks only 
that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper 
than yourself but does it follow that had he married you 
he would have been happy the inconveniences would have 
been different he would then have suffered under the 
pecuniary distresses which because they are removed 
he now reckons as nothing he would have had a wife 
of whose temper he could make no complaint but he would 
have been always necessitous always poor and probably 
would soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts 
of a clear estate and good income as of far more importance 
even to domestic happiness than the mere temper of a wife 
i have not a doubt of it said marianne and i 
have nothing to regret nothing but my own folly 
rather say your mother s imprudence my child 
said mrs dashwood she must be answerable 
marianne would not let her proceed and elinor 
satisfied that each felt their own error wished to avoid 
any survey of the past that might weaken her sister s 
spirits she therefore pursuing the first subject 
immediately continued 
one observation may i think be fairly drawn from 
the whole of the story that all willoughby s difficulties 
have arisen from the first offence against virtue in his 
behaviour to eliza williams that crime has been the origin 
of every lesser one and of all his present discontents 
marianne assented most feelingly to the remark 
and her mother was led by it to an enumeration of colonel 
brandon s injuries and merits warm as friendship 
and design could unitedly dictate her daughter did 
not look however as if much of it were heard by her 
elinor according to her expectation saw on the two 
or three following days that marianne did not continue 
to gain strength as she had done but while her resolution 
was unsubdued and she still tried to appear cheerful 
and easy her sister could safely trust to the effect 
of time upon her health 
margaret returned and the family were again all 
restored to each other again quietly settled at the cottage 
and if not pursuing their usual studies with quite 
so much vigour as when they first came to barton 
at least planning a vigorous prosecution of them in future 
elinor grew impatient for some tidings of edward 
she had heard nothing of him since her leaving london 
nothing new of his plans nothing certain even of his 
present abode some letters had passed between her 
and her brother in consequence of marianne s illness 
and in the first of john s there had been this sentence 
we know nothing of our unfortunate edward and can make no 
enquiries on so prohibited a subject but conclude him 
to be still at oxford which was all the intelligence 
of edward afforded her by the correspondence for his name 
was not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters 
she was not doomed however to be long in ignorance of 
his measures 
their man servant had been sent one morning to exeter 
on business and when as he waited at table he had 
satisfied the inquiries of his mistress as to the event 
of his errand this was his voluntary communication 
i suppose you know madam that mr ferrars is married 
marianne gave a violent start fixed her eyes 
upon elinor saw her turning pale and fell back in her 
chair in hysterics mrs dashwood whose eyes as she 
answered the servant s inquiry had intuitively taken 
the same direction was shocked to perceive by elinor s 
countenance how much she really suffered and a moment 
afterwards alike distressed by marianne s situation 
knew not on which child to bestow her principal attention 
the servant who saw only that miss marianne was 
taken ill had sense enough to call one of the maids 
who with mrs dashwood s assistance supported her into 
the other room by that time marianne was rather better 
and her mother leaving her to the care of margaret 
and the maid returned to elinor who though still 
much disordered had so far recovered the use of her reason 
and voice as to be just beginning an inquiry of thomas 
as to the source of his intelligence mrs dashwood 
immediately took all that trouble on herself and elinor 
had the benefit of the information without the exertion 
of seeking it 
who told you that mr ferrars was married thomas 
i see mr ferrars myself madam this morning 
in exeter and his lady too miss steele as was they was 
stopping in a chaise at the door of the new london inn 
as i went there with a message from sally at the park 
to her brother who is one of the post boys i happened 
to look up as i went by the chaise and so i see directly 
it was the youngest miss steele so i took off my hat 
and she knew me and called to me and inquired after you 
madam and the young ladies especially miss marianne 
and bid me i should give her compliments and mr ferrars s 
their best compliments and service and how sorry they 
was they had not time to come on and see you but they was 
in a great hurry to go forwards for they was going further 
down for a little while but howsever when they come back 
they would make sure to come and see you 
but did she tell you she was married thomas 
yes madam she smiled and said how she 
had changed her name since she was in these parts 
she was always a very affable and free spoken young lady 
and very civil behaved so i made free to wish her joy 
was mr ferrars in the carriage with her 
yes madam i just see him leaning back in it 
but he did not look up he never was a gentleman much 
for talking 
elinor s heart could easily account for his not 
putting himself forward and mrs dashwood probably 
found the same explanation 
was there no one else in the carriage 
no madam only they two 
do you know where they came from 
they come straight from town as miss lucy 
mrs ferrars told me 
and are they going farther westward 
yes madam but not to bide long they will soon 
be back again and then they would be sure and call here 
mrs dashwood now looked at her daughter 
but elinor knew better than to expect them 
she recognised the whole of lucy in the message and was 
very confident that edward would never come near them 
she observed in a low voice to her mother that they 
were probably going down to mr pratt s near plymouth 
thomas s intelligence seemed over elinor looked 
as if she wished to hear more 
did you see them off before you came away 
no madam the horses were just coming out but i 
could not bide any longer i was afraid of being late 
did mrs ferrars look well 
yes madam she said how she was very well 
and to my mind she was always a very handsome young 
lady and she seemed vastly contented 
mrs dashwood could think of no other question 
and thomas and the tablecloth now alike needless 
were soon afterwards dismissed marianne had already sent 
to say that she should eat nothing more mrs dashwood s 
and elinor s appetites were equally lost and margaret 
might think herself very well off that with so much 
uneasiness as both her sisters had lately experienced 
so much reason as they had often had to be careless 
of their meals she had never been obliged to go without 
her dinner before 
when the dessert and the wine were arranged 
and mrs dashwood and elinor were left by themselves 
they remained long together in a similarity of thoughtfulness 
and silence mrs dashwood feared to hazard any remark 
and ventured not to offer consolation she now found 
that she had erred in relying on elinor s representation 
of herself and justly concluded that every thing 
had been expressly softened at the time to spare her 
from an increase of unhappiness suffering as she then 
had suffered for marianne she found that she had been 
misled by the careful the considerate attention of 
her daughter to think the attachment which once she 
had so well understood much slighter in reality than 
she had been will not to believe or than it was now proved 
to be she feared that under this persuasion she had 
been unjust inattentive nay almost unkind to her elinor 
that marianne s affliction because more acknowledged 
more immediately before her had too much engrossed 
her tenderness and led her away to forget that in elinor 
she might have a daughter suffering almost as much 
certainly with less self provocation and greater fortitude 
chapter 
elinor now found the difference between the expectation 
of an unpleasant event however certain the mind may be told 
to consider it and certainty itself she now found that 
in spite of herself she had always admitted a hope 
while edward remained single that something would occur 
to prevent his marrying lucy that some resolution of 
his own some mediation of friends or some more eligible 
opportunity of establishment for the lady would arise 
to assist the happiness of all but he was now married 
and she condemned her heart for the lurking flattery 
which so much heightened the pain of the intelligence 
that he should be married soon before as she imagined 
he could be in orders and consequently before he could 
be in possession of the living surprised her a little 
at first but she soon saw how likely it was that lucy 
in her self provident care in her haste to secure him 
should overlook every thing but the risk of delay 
they were married married in town and now hastening 
down to her uncle s what had edward felt on being within 
four miles from barton on seeing her mother s servant 
on hearing lucy s message 
they would soon she supposed be settled at 
delaford delaford that place in which so much 
conspired to give her an interest which she wished 
to be acquainted with and yet desired to avoid 
she saw them in an instant in their parsonage house saw 
in lucy the active contriving manager uniting at once 
a desire of smart appearance with the utmost frugality 
and ashamed to be suspected of half her economical practices 
pursuing her own interest in every thought courting the 
favour of colonel brandon of mrs jennings and of every 
wealthy friend in edward she knew not what she saw 
nor what she wished to see happy or unhappy nothing 
pleased her she turned away her head from every sketch of him 
elinor flattered herself that some one of their 
connections in london would write to them to announce 
the event and give farther particulars but day after 
day passed off and brought no letter no tidings 
though uncertain that any one were to blame she found 
fault with every absent friend they were all thoughtless 
or indolent 
when do you write to colonel brandon madam 
was an inquiry which sprung from the impatience 
of her mind to have something going on 
i wrote to him my love last week and rather 
expect to see than to hear from him again i earnestly 
pressed his coming to us and should not be surprised 
to see him walk in today or tomorrow or any day 
this was gaining something something to look forward to 
colonel brandon must have some information to give 
scarcely had she so determined it when the figure 
of a man on horseback drew her eyes to the window 
he stopt at their gate it was a gentleman it 
was colonel brandon himself now she could hear more 
and she trembled in expectation of it but it was 
not colonel brandon neither his air nor his height 
were it possible she must say it must be edward 
she looked again he had just dismounted she could not be 
mistaken it was edward she moved away and sat down 
he comes from mr pratt s purposely to see us i will be 
calm i will be mistress of myself 
in a moment she perceived that the others were likewise 
aware of the mistake she saw her mother and marianne 
change colour saw them look at herself and whisper 
a few sentences to each other she would have given 
the world to be able to speak and to make them understand 
that she hoped no coolness no slight would appear 
in their behaviour to him but she had no utterance 
and was obliged to leave all to their own discretion 
not a syllable passed aloud they all waited 
in silence for the appearance of their visitor 
his footsteps were heard along the gravel path in a moment 
he was in the passage and in another he was before them 
his countenance as he entered the room was not 
too happy even for elinor his complexion was white 
with agitation and he looked as if fearful of his 
reception and conscious that he merited no kind one 
mrs dashwood however conforming as she trusted 
to the wishes of that daughter by whom she then meant 
in the warmth of her heart to be guided in every thing 
met with a look of forced complacency gave him her hand 
and wished him joy 
he coloured and stammered out an unintelligible reply 
elinor s lips had moved with her mother s and when the 
moment of action was over she wished that she had shaken 
hands with him too but it was then too late and with a 
countenance meaning to be open she sat down again 
and talked of the weather 
marianne had retreated as much as possible 
out of sight to conceal her distress and margaret 
understanding some part but not the whole of the case 
thought it incumbent on her to be dignified and therefore 
took a seat as far from him as she could and maintained 
a strict silence 
when elinor had ceased to rejoice in the dryness 
of the season a very awful pause took place it was put 
an end to by mrs dashwood who felt obliged to hope that he 
had left mrs ferrars very well in a hurried manner 
he replied in the affirmative 
another pause 
elinor resolving to exert herself though fearing 
the sound of her own voice now said 
is mrs ferrars at longstaple 
at longstaple he replied with an air of surprise 
no my mother is in town 
i meant said elinor taking up some work from 
the table to inquire for mrs edward ferrars 
she dared not look up but her mother and marianne both 
turned their eyes on him he coloured seemed perplexed 
looked doubtingly and after some hesitation said 
perhaps you mean my brother you mean mrs mrs 
robert ferrars 
mrs robert ferrars was repeated by marianne and her 
mother in an accent of the utmost amazement and though 
elinor could not speak even her eyes were fixed on him 
with the same impatient wonder he rose from his seat 
and walked to the window apparently from not knowing 
what to do took up a pair of scissors that lay there 
and while spoiling both them and their sheath by cutting 
the latter to pieces as he spoke said in a hurried voice 
perhaps you do not know you may not have heard 
that my brother is lately married to to the youngest to 
miss lucy steele 
his words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment 
by all but elinor who sat with her head leaning over 
her work in a state of such agitation as made her hardly 
know where she was 
yes said he they were married last week 
and are now at dawlish 
elinor could sit it no longer she almost ran 
out of the room and as soon as the door was closed 
burst into tears of joy which at first she thought would 
never cease edward who had till then looked any where 
rather than at her saw her hurry away and perhaps saw 
or even heard her emotion for immediately afterwards 
he fell into a reverie which no remarks no inquiries 
no affectionate address of mrs dashwood could penetrate 
and at last without saying a word quitted the room 
and walked out towards the village leaving the others 
in the greatest astonishment and perplexity on a change 
in his situation so wonderful and so sudden a perplexity 
which they had no means of lessening but by their 
own conjectures 
chapter 
unaccountable however as the circumstances of his 
release might appear to the whole family it was certain 
that edward was free and to what purpose that freedom would 
be employed was easily pre determined by all for after 
experiencing the blessings of one imprudent engagement 
contracted without his mother s consent as he had already 
done for more than four years nothing less could be expected 
of him in the failure of that than the immediate contraction 
of another 
his errand at barton in fact was a simple one 
it was only to ask elinor to marry him and considering 
that he was not altogether inexperienced in such a question 
it might be strange that he should feel so uncomfortable 
in the present case as he really did so much in need of 
encouragement and fresh air 
how soon he had walked himself into the proper 
resolution however how soon an opportunity of exercising 
it occurred in what manner he expressed himself 
and how he was received need not be particularly told 
this only need be said that when they all sat down to 
table at four of the clock about three hours after his arrival 
he had secured his lady engaged her mother s consent 
and was not only in the rapturous profession of 
the lover but in the reality of reason and truth 
one of the happiest of men his situation indeed was 
more than commonly joyful he had more than the ordinary 
triumph of accepted love to swell his heart and raise 
his spirits he was released without any reproach 
to himself from an entanglement which had long formed 
his misery from a woman whom he had long ceased to love 
and elevated at once to that security with another 
which he must have thought of almost with despair 
as soon as he had learnt to consider it with desire 
he was brought not from doubt or suspense but from 
misery to happiness and the change was openly spoken 
in such a genuine flowing grateful cheerfulness 
as his friends had never witnessed in him before 
his heart was now open to elinor all its weaknesses 
all its errors confessed and his first boyish attachment 
to lucy treated with all the philosophic dignity of twenty four 
it was a foolish idle inclination on my side 
said he the consequence of ignorance of the world 
and want of employment had my brother given me 
some active profession when i was removed at eighteen 
from the care of mr pratt i think nay i am sure 
it would never have happened for though i left longstaple 
with what i thought at the time a most unconquerable 
preference for his niece yet had i then had any pursuit 
any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance 
from her for a few months i should very soon have 
outgrown the fancied attachment especially by mixing 
more with the world as in such case i must have done 
but instead of having any thing to do instead of having any 
profession chosen for me or being allowed to chuse any myself 
i returned home to be completely idle and for the first 
twelvemonth afterwards i had not even the nominal employment 
which belonging to the university would have given me 
for i was not entered at oxford till i was nineteen 
i had therefore nothing in the world to do but to fancy 
myself in love and as my mother did not make my home 
in every respect comfortable as i had no friend 
no companion in my brother and disliked new acquaintance 
it was not unnatural for me to be very often at longstaple 
where i always felt myself at home and was always sure 
of a welcome and accordingly i spent the greatest part 
of my time there from eighteen to nineteen lucy appeared 
everything that was amiable and obliging she was pretty 
too at least i thought so then and i had seen so little 
of other women that i could make no comparisons and see 
no defects considering everything therefore i hope 
foolish as our engagement was foolish as it has since 
in every way been proved it was not at the time an unnatural 
or an inexcusable piece of folly 
the change which a few hours had wrought in the minds 
and the happiness of the dashwoods was such so great as 
promised them all the satisfaction of a sleepless night 
mrs dashwood too happy to be comfortable knew not how 
to love edward nor praise elinor enough how to be enough 
thankful for his release without wounding his delicacy 
nor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained 
conversation together and yet enjoy as she wished 
the sight and society of both 
marianne could speak her happiness only by tears 
comparisons would occur regrets would arise and her joy 
though sincere as her love for her sister was of a kind to 
give her neither spirits nor language 
but elinor how are her feelings to be described from 
the moment of learning that lucy was married to another 
that edward was free to the moment of his justifying 
the hopes which had so instantly followed she was every 
thing by turns but tranquil but when the second moment 
had passed when she found every doubt every solicitude 
removed compared her situation with what so lately it 
had been saw him honourably released from his former 
engagement saw him instantly profiting by the release 
to address herself and declare an affection as tender 
as constant as she had ever supposed it to be she 
was oppressed she was overcome by her own felicity 
and happily disposed as is the human mind to be easily 
familiarized with any change for the better it required 
several hours to give sedateness to her spirits or any 
degree of tranquillity to her heart 
edward was now fixed at the cottage at least for 
a week for whatever other claims might be made on him 
it was impossible that less than a week should be given 
up to the enjoyment of elinor s company or suffice 
to say half that was to be said of the past the present 
and the future for though a very few hours spent in 
the hard labor of incessant talking will despatch more 
subjects than can really be in common between any two 
rational creatures yet with lovers it is different 
between them no subject is finished no communication 
is even made till it has been made at least twenty 
times over 
lucy s marriage the unceasing and reasonable wonder 
among them all formed of course one of the earliest 
discussions of the lovers and elinor s particular knowledge 
of each party made it appear to her in every view as one 
of the most extraordinary and unaccountable circumstances 
she had ever heard how they could be thrown together 
and by what attraction robert could be drawn on to marry 
a girl of whose beauty she had herself heard him speak 
without any admiration a girl too already engaged 
to his brother and on whose account that brother had been 
thrown off by his family it was beyond her comprehension 
to make out to her own heart it was a delightful affair 
to her imagination it was even a ridiculous one but 
to her reason her judgment it was completely a puzzle 
edward could only attempt an explanation by supposing 
that perhaps at first accidentally meeting the vanity 
of the one had been so worked on by the flattery 
of the other as to lead by degrees to all the rest 
elinor remembered what robert had told her in harley street 
of his opinion of what his own mediation in his brother s 
affairs might have done if applied to in time 
she repeated it to edward 
that was exactly like robert was his immediate 
observation and that he presently added might 
perhaps be in his head when the acquaintance between 
them first began and lucy perhaps at first might 
think only of procuring his good offices in my favour 
other designs might afterward arise 
how long it had been carrying on between them 
however he was equally at a loss with herself to make out 
for at oxford where he had remained for choice ever since 
his quitting london he had had no means of hearing of her 
but from herself and her letters to the very last were 
neither less frequent nor less affectionate than usual 
not the smallest suspicion therefore had ever occurred 
to prepare him for what followed and when at last it 
burst on him in a letter from lucy herself he had been 
for some time he believed half stupified between 
the wonder the horror and the joy of such a deliverance 
he put the letter into elinor s hands 
dear sir 
being very sure i have long lost your affections 
i have thought myself at liberty to bestow my own 
on another and have no doubt of being as happy with 
him as i once used to think i might be with you 
but i scorn to accept a hand while the heart was 
another s sincerely wish you happy in your choice 
and it shall not be my fault if we are not always 
good friends as our near relationship now makes 
proper i can safely say i owe you no ill will 
and am sure you will be too generous to do us any 
ill offices your brother has gained my affections 
entirely and as we could not live without one 
another we are just returned from the altar and 
are now on our way to dawlish for a few weeks which 
place your dear brother has great curiosity to see 
but thought i would first trouble you with these 
few lines and shall always remain 
your sincere well wisher friend and sister 
lucy ferrars 
i have burnt all your letters and will return 
your picture the first opportunity please to destroy 
my scrawls but the ring with my hair you are very 
welcome to keep 
elinor read and returned it without any comment 
i will not ask your opinion of it as a composition 
said edward for worlds would not i have had a letter 
of hers seen by you in former days in a sister it 
is bad enough but in a wife how i have blushed over 
the pages of her writing and i believe i may say that 
since the first half year of our foolish business this 
is the only letter i ever received from her of which 
the substance made me any amends for the defect of the style 
however it may have come about said elinor 
after a pause they are certainly married and your mother 
has brought on herself a most appropriate punishment 
the independence she settled on robert through resentment 
against you has put it in his power to make his own choice 
and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand 
a year to do the very deed which she disinherited the 
other for intending to do she will hardly be less hurt 
i suppose by robert s marrying lucy than she would have 
been by your marrying her 
she will be more hurt by it for robert always 
was her favourite she will be more hurt by it 
and on the same principle will forgive him much sooner 
in what state the affair stood at present between them 
edward knew not for no communication with any of his family 
had yet been attempted by him he had quitted oxford 
within four and twenty hours after lucy s letter arrived 
and with only one object before him the nearest road 
to barton had had no leisure to form any scheme of conduct 
with which that road did not hold the most intimate connection 
he could do nothing till he were assured of his fate with 
miss dashwood and by his rapidity in seeking that fate 
it is to be supposed in spite of the jealousy with 
which he had once thought of colonel brandon in spite 
of the modesty with which he rated his own deserts 
and the politeness with which he talked of his doubts 
he did not upon the whole expect a very cruel reception 
it was his business however to say that he did and he 
said it very prettily what he might say on the subject 
a twelvemonth after must be referred to the imagination 
of husbands and wives 
that lucy had certainly meant to deceive to go off 
with a flourish of malice against him in her message 
by thomas was perfectly clear to elinor and edward himself 
now thoroughly enlightened on her character had no 
scruple in believing her capable of the utmost meanness 
of wanton ill nature though his eyes had been long opened 
even before his acquaintance with elinor began to her 
ignorance and a want of liberality in some of her opinions 
they had been equally imputed by him to her want 
of education and till her last letter reached him 
he had always believed her to be a well disposed 
good hearted girl and thoroughly attached to himself 
nothing but such a persuasion could have prevented 
his putting an end to an engagement which long before 
the discovery of it laid him open to his mother s anger 
had been a continual source of disquiet and regret to him 
i thought it my duty said he independent of my feelings 
to give her the option of continuing the engagement or not 
when i was renounced by my mother and stood to all 
appearance without a friend in the world to assist me 
in such a situation as that where there seemed nothing 
to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living creature 
how could i suppose when she so earnestly so warmly insisted 
on sharing my fate whatever it might be that any thing 
but the most disinterested affection was her inducement 
and even now i cannot comprehend on what motive she acted 
or what fancied advantage it could be to her to be 
fettered to a man for whom she had not the smallest regard 
and who had only two thousand pounds in the world 
she could not foresee that colonel brandon would give me a 
living 
no but she might suppose that something would occur 
in your favour that your own family might in time relent 
and at any rate she lost nothing by continuing the engagement 
for she has proved that it fettered neither her inclination 
nor her actions the connection was certainly a 
respectable one and probably gained her consideration among 
her friends and if nothing more advantageous occurred 
it would be better for her to marry you than be single 
edward was of course immediately convinced that 
nothing could have been more natural than lucy s conduct 
nor more self evident than the motive of it 
elinor scolded him harshly as ladies always scold 
the imprudence which compliments themselves for having 
spent so much time with them at norland when he must 
have felt his own inconstancy 
your behaviour was certainly very wrong said she 
because to say nothing of my own conviction our relations 
were all led away by it to fancy and expect what as you 
were then situated could never be 
he could only plead an ignorance of his own heart 
and a mistaken confidence in the force of his engagement 
i was simple enough to think that because my faith 
was plighted to another there could be no danger in my being 
with you and that the consciousness of my engagement was 
to keep my heart as safe and sacred as my honour i felt 
that i admired you but i told myself it was only friendship 
and till i began to make comparisons between yourself 
and lucy i did not know how far i was got after that 
i suppose i was wrong in remaining so much in sussex 
and the arguments with which i reconciled myself to the 
expediency of it were no better than these the danger 
is my own i am doing no injury to anybody but myself 
elinor smiled and shook her head 
edward heard with pleasure of colonel brandon s 
being expected at the cottage as he really wished 
not only to be better acquainted with him but to have an 
opportunity of convincing him that he no longer resented 
his giving him the living of delaford which at present 
said he after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine 
were on the occasion he must think i have never forgiven 
him for offering 
now he felt astonished himself that he had never yet 
been to the place but so little interest had be taken 
in the matter that he owed all his knowledge of the house 
garden and glebe extent of the parish condition of 
the land and rate of the tithes to elinor herself 
who had heard so much of it from colonel brandon 
and heard it with so much attention as to be entirely 
mistress of the subject 
one question after this only remained undecided 
between them one difficulty only was to be overcome 
they were brought together by mutual affection 
with the warmest approbation of their real friends 
their intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make 
their happiness certain and they only wanted something 
to live upon edward had two thousand pounds and elinor 
one which with delaford living was all that they could 
call their own for it was impossible that mrs dashwood 
should advance anything and they were neither of them 
quite enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty 
pounds a year would supply them with the comforts of life 
edward was not entirely without hopes of some 
favourable change in his mother towards him and on that 
he rested for the residue of their income but elinor 
had no such dependence for since edward would still 
be unable to marry miss morton and his chusing herself 
had been spoken of in mrs ferrars s flattering language 
as only a lesser evil than his chusing lucy steele 
she feared that robert s offence would serve no other 
purpose than to enrich fanny 
about four days after edward s arrival colonel 
brandon appeared to complete mrs dashwood s satisfaction 
and to give her the dignity of having for the first time 
since her living at barton more company with her than 
her house would hold edward was allowed to retain the 
privilege of first comer and colonel brandon therefore 
walked every night to his old quarters at the park 
from whence he usually returned in the morning early enough 
to interrupt the lovers first tete a tete before breakfast 
a three weeks residence at delaford where 
in his evening hours at least he had little to do 
but to calculate the disproportion between thirty six 
and seventeen brought him to barton in a temper of mind 
which needed all the improvement in marianne s looks 
all the kindness of her welcome and all the encouragement 
of her mother s language to make it cheerful 
among such friends however and such flattery he did revive 
no rumour of lucy s marriage had yet reached him he knew 
nothing of what had passed and the first hours of his 
visit were consequently spent in hearing and in wondering 
every thing was explained to him by mrs dashwood 
and he found fresh reason to rejoice in what he had done 
for mr ferrars since eventually it promoted the interest 
of elinor 
it would be needless to say that the gentlemen advanced 
in the good opinion of each other as they advanced in each 
other s acquaintance for it could not be otherwise 
their resemblance in good principles and good sense 
in disposition and manner of thinking would probably 
have been sufficient to unite them in friendship 
without any other attraction but their being in love 
with two sisters and two sisters fond of each other 
made that mutual regard inevitable and immediate 
which might otherwise have waited the effect of time 
and judgment 
the letters from town which a few days before would 
have made every nerve in elinor s body thrill with transport 
now arrived to be read with less emotion that mirth 
mrs jennings wrote to tell the wonderful tale to vent her 
honest indignation against the jilting girl and pour forth 
her compassion towards poor mr edward who she was sure 
had quite doted upon the worthless hussy and was now 
by all accounts almost broken hearted at oxford 
i do think she continued nothing was ever carried 
on so sly for it was but two days before lucy called 
and sat a couple of hours with me not a soul suspected 
anything of the matter not even nancy who poor soul 
came crying to me the day after in a great fright 
for fear of mrs ferrars as well as not knowing how to 
get to plymouth for lucy it seems borrowed all her 
money before she went off to be married on purpose 
we suppose to make a show with and poor nancy had not 
seven shillings in the world so i was very glad to give 
her five guineas to take her down to exeter where she 
thinks of staying three or four weeks with mrs burgess 
in hopes as i tell her to fall in with the doctor again 
and i must say that lucy s crossness not to take them 
along with them in the chaise is worse than all 
poor mr edward i cannot get him out of my head but you 
must send for him to barton and miss marianne must try to 
comfort him 
mr dashwood s strains were more solemn 
mrs ferrars was the most unfortunate of women poor 
fanny had suffered agonies of sensibility and he 
considered the existence of each under such a blow 
with grateful wonder robert s offence was unpardonable 
but lucy s was infinitely worse neither of them were 
ever again to be mentioned to mrs ferrars and even 
if she might hereafter be induced to forgive her son 
his wife should never be acknowledged as her daughter 
nor be permitted to appear in her presence the secrecy 
with which everything had been carried on between them 
was rationally treated as enormously heightening 
the crime because had any suspicion of it occurred 
to the others proper measures would have been taken 
to prevent the marriage and he called on elinor to join 
with him in regretting that lucy s engagement with edward 
had not rather been fulfilled than that she should thus 
be the means of spreading misery farther in the family 
he thus continued 
mrs ferrars has never yet mentioned edward s name 
which does not surprise us but to our great astonishment 
not a line has been received from him on the occasion 
perhaps however he is kept silent by his fear of offending 
and i shall therefore give him a hint by a line 
to oxford that his sister and i both think a letter 
of proper submission from him addressed perhaps to fanny 
and by her shewn to her mother might not be taken amiss 
for we all know the tenderness of mrs ferrars s heart 
and that she wishes for nothing so much as to be on good terms 
with her children 
this paragraph was of some importance to the 
prospects and conduct of edward it determined him 
to attempt a reconciliation though not exactly 
in the manner pointed out by their brother and sister 
a letter of proper submission repeated he 
would they have me beg my mother s pardon for robert s 
ingratitude to her and breach of honour to me i can 
make no submission i am grown neither humble nor 
penitent by what has passed i am grown very happy 
but that would not interest i know of no submission 
that is proper for me to make 
you may certainly ask to be forgiven said elinor 
because you have offended and i should think you 
might now venture so far as to profess some concern 
for having ever formed the engagement which drew on you 
your mother s anger 
he agreed that he might 
and when she has forgiven you perhaps a little humility 
may be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement 
almost as imprudent in her eyes as the first 
he had nothing to urge against it but still 
resisted the idea of a letter of proper submission 
and therefore to make it easier to him as he declared 
a much greater willingness to make mean concessions 
by word of mouth than on paper it was resolved that 
instead of writing to fanny he should go to london 
and personally intreat her good offices in his favour 
and if they really do interest themselves said marianne 
in her new character of candour in bringing about 
a reconciliation i shall think that even john and fanny 
are not entirely without merit 
after a visit on colonel brandon s side of only three 
or four days the two gentlemen quitted barton together 
they were to go immediately to delaford that edward 
might have some personal knowledge of his future home 
and assist his patron and friend in deciding on what 
improvements were needed to it and from thence 
after staying there a couple of nights he was to proceed 
on his journey to town 
chapter 
after a proper resistance on the part of mrs ferrars 
just so violent and so steady as to preserve her from that 
reproach which she always seemed fearful of incurring 
the reproach of being too amiable edward was admitted 
to her presence and pronounced to be again her son 
her family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating 
for many years of her life she had had two sons 
but the crime and annihilation of edward a few weeks ago 
had robbed her of one the similar annihilation of robert 
had left her for a fortnight without any and now 
by the resuscitation of edward she had one again 
in spite of his being allowed once more to live 
however he did not feel the continuance of his existence 
secure till he had revealed his present engagement 
for the publication of that circumstance he feared 
might give a sudden turn to his constitution and carry 
him off as rapidly as before with apprehensive caution 
therefore it was revealed and he was listened to with 
unexpected calmness mrs ferrars at first reasonably 
endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying miss dashwood 
by every argument in her power told him that in miss morton 
he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune 
and enforced the assertion by observing that miss morton 
was the daughter of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds 
while miss dashwood was only the daughter of a private 
gentleman with no more than three but when she found that 
though perfectly admitting the truth of her representation 
he was by no means inclined to be guided by it 
she judged it wisest from the experience of the past 
to submit and therefore after such an ungracious delay 
as she owed to her own dignity and as served to prevent 
every suspicion of good will she issued her decree 
of consent to the marriage of edward and elinor 
what she would engage to do towards augmenting 
their income was next to be considered and here it 
plainly appeared that though edward was now her only son 
he was by no means her eldest for while robert was 
inevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a year 
not the smallest objection was made against edward s taking 
orders for the sake of two hundred and fifty at the utmost 
nor was anything promised either for the present or in future 
beyond the ten thousand pounds which had been given with fanny 
it was as much however as was desired 
and more than was expected by edward and elinor 
and mrs ferrars herself by her shuffling excuses 
seemed the only person surprised at her not giving more 
with an income quite sufficient to their wants 
thus secured to them they had nothing to wait for 
after edward was in possession of the living but the 
readiness of the house to which colonel brandon 
with an eager desire for the accommodation of elinor 
was making considerable improvements and after waiting 
some time for their completion after experiencing 
as usual a thousand disappointments and delays 
from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen elinor 
as usual broke through the first positive resolution 
of not marrying till every thing was ready and the 
ceremony took place in barton church early in the autumn 
the first month after their marriage was spent 
with their friend at the mansion house from whence 
they could superintend the progress of the parsonage 
and direct every thing as they liked on the spot 
could chuse papers project shrubberies and invent a sweep 
mrs jennings s prophecies though rather jumbled together 
were chiefly fulfilled for she was able to visit edward 
and his wife in their parsonage by michaelmas and she 
found in elinor and her husband as she really believed 
one of the happiest couples in the world they had 
in fact nothing to wish for but the marriage of colonel 
brandon and marianne and rather better pasturage for 
their cows 
they were visited on their first settling by almost 
all their relations and friends mrs ferrars came 
to inspect the happiness which she was almost ashamed 
of having authorised and even the dashwoods were at 
the expense of a journey from sussex to do them honour 
i will not say that i am disappointed my dear sister 
said john as they were walking together one morning before 
the gates of delaford house that would be saying too much 
for certainly you have been one of the most fortunate young 
women in the world as it is but i confess it would 
give me great pleasure to call colonel brandon brother 
his property here his place his house every thing is in 
such respectable and excellent condition and his woods i 
have not seen such timber any where in dorsetshire as there 
is now standing in delaford hanger and though perhaps 
marianne may not seem exactly the person to attract him 
yet i think it would altogether be advisable for you to 
have them now frequently staying with you for as colonel 
brandon seems a great deal at home nobody can tell what 
may happen for when people are much thrown together 
and see little of anybody else and it will always be 
in your power to set her off to advantage and so forth 
in short you may as well give her a chance you understand 
me 
but though mrs ferrars did come to see them and always 
treated them with the make believe of decent affection 
they were never insulted by her real favour and preference 
that was due to the folly of robert and the cunning 
of his wife and it was earned by them before many months 
had passed away the selfish sagacity of the latter 
which had at first drawn robert into the scrape 
was the principal instrument of his deliverance from it 
for her respectful humility assiduous attentions 
and endless flatteries as soon as the smallest opening 
was given for their exercise reconciled mrs ferrars 
to his choice and re established him completely in 
her favour 
the whole of lucy s behaviour in the affair 
and the prosperity which crowned it therefore may be held 
forth as a most encouraging instance of what an earnest 
an unceasing attention to self interest however its progress 
may be apparently obstructed will do in securing every 
advantage of fortune with no other sacrifice than that of time 
and conscience when robert first sought her acquaintance 
and privately visited her in bartlett s buildings 
it was only with the view imputed to him by his brother 
he merely meant to persuade her to give up the engagement 
and as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection 
of both he naturally expected that one or two interviews 
would settle the matter in that point however 
and that only he erred for though lucy soon gave him 
hopes that his eloquence would convince her in time 
another visit another conversation was always wanted 
to produce this conviction some doubts always lingered 
in her mind when they parted which could only be 
removed by another half hour s discourse with himself 
his attendance was by this means secured and the rest 
followed in course instead of talking of edward 
they came gradually to talk only of robert a subject 
on which he had always more to say than on any other 
and in which she soon betrayed an interest even equal 
to his own and in short it became speedily evident 
to both that he had entirely supplanted his brother 
he was proud of his conquest proud of tricking edward 
and very proud of marrying privately without his 
mother s consent what immediately followed is known 
they passed some months in great happiness at dawlish 
for she had many relations and old acquaintances to 
cut and he drew several plans for magnificent cottages 
and from thence returning to town procured the forgiveness 
of mrs ferrars by the simple expedient of asking it 
which at lucy s instigation was adopted the forgiveness 
at first indeed as was reasonable comprehended only robert 
and lucy who had owed his mother no duty and therefore 
could have transgressed none still remained some weeks 
longer unpardoned but perseverance in humility of conduct 
and messages in self condemnation for robert s offence 
and gratitude for the unkindness she was treated with 
procured her in time the haughty notice which overcame 
her by its graciousness and led soon afterwards by rapid 
degrees to the highest state of affection and influence 
lucy became as necessary to mrs ferrars as either robert 
or fanny and while edward was never cordially forgiven 
for having once intended to marry her and elinor 
though superior to her in fortune and birth was spoken 
of as an intruder she was in every thing considered 
and always openly acknowledged to be a favourite child 
they settled in town received very liberal assistance 
from mrs ferrars were on the best terms imaginable 
with the dashwoods and setting aside the jealousies 
and ill will continually subsisting between fanny and lucy 
in which their husbands of course took a part as well 
as the frequent domestic disagreements between robert and 
lucy themselves nothing could exceed the harmony in which 
they all lived together 
what edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest 
son might have puzzled many people to find out and what 
robert had done to succeed to it might have puzzled them 
still more it was an arrangement however justified in 
its effects if not in its because for nothing ever 
appeared in robert s style of living or of talking to give 
a suspicion of his regretting the extent of his income 
as either leaving his brother too little or bringing 
himself too much and if edward might be judged from 
the ready discharge of his duties in every particular 
from an increasing attachment to his wife and his home 
and from the regular cheerfulness of his spirits 
he might be supposed no less contented with his lot 
no less free from every wish of an exchange 
elinor s marriage divided her as little from her 
family as could well be contrived without rendering 
the cottage at barton entirely useless for her mother 
and sisters spent much more than half their time with her 
mrs dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well 
as pleasure in the frequency of her visits at delaford 
for her wish of bringing marianne and colonel brandon together 
was hardly less earnest though rather more liberal than 
what john had expressed it was now her darling object 
precious as was the company of her daughter to her 
she desired nothing so much as to give up its constant 
enjoyment to her valued friend and to see marianne settled at 
the mansion house was equally the wish of edward and elinor 
they each felt his sorrows and their own obligations 
and marianne by general consent was to be the reward 
of all 
with such a confederacy against her with a knowledge 
so intimate of his goodness with a conviction of his fond 
attachment to herself which at last though long after it 
was observable to everybody else burst on her what could she 
do 
marianne dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate 
she was born to discover the falsehood of her own opinions 
and to counteract by her conduct her most favourite maxims 
she was born to overcome an affection formed so late 
in life as at seventeen and with no sentiment 
superior to strong esteem and lively friendship 
voluntarily to give her hand to another and that other 
a man who had suffered no less than herself under the 
event of a former attachment whom two years before 
she had considered too old to be married and who still 
sought the constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat 
but so it was instead of falling a sacrifice 
to an irresistible passion as once she had fondly 
flattered herself with expecting instead of remaining 
even for ever with her mother and finding her only 
pleasures in retirement and study as afterwards in her 
more calm and sober judgment she had determined on 
she found herself at nineteen submitting to new attachments 
entering on new duties placed in a new home a wife 
the mistress of a family and the patroness of a village 
colonel brandon was now as happy as all those who best 
loved him believed he deserved to be in marianne he 
was consoled for every past affliction her regard and her 
society restored his mind to animation and his spirits 
to cheerfulness and that marianne found her own happiness 
in forming his was equally the persuasion and delight 
of each observing friend marianne could never love 
by halves and her whole heart became in time as much 
devoted to her husband as it had once been to willoughby 
willoughby could not hear of her marriage without 
a pang and his punishment was soon afterwards complete 
in the voluntary forgiveness of mrs smith who by stating 
his marriage with a woman of character as the source 
of her clemency gave him reason for believing that had he 
behaved with honour towards marianne he might at once have 
been happy and rich that his repentance of misconduct 
which thus brought its own punishment was sincere 
need not be doubted nor that he long thought of colonel 
brandon with envy and of marianne with regret but that 
he was for ever inconsolable that he fled from society 
or contracted an habitual gloom of temper or died of a 
broken heart must not be depended on for he did neither 
he lived to exert and frequently to enjoy himself 
his wife was not always out of humour nor his home 
always uncomfortable and in his breed of horses and dogs 
and in sporting of every kind he found no inconsiderable 
degree of domestic felicity 
for marianne however in spite of his incivility 
in surviving her loss he always retained that decided 
regard which interested him in every thing that befell her 
and made her his secret standard of perfection in woman 
and many a rising beauty would be slighted by him in 
after days as bearing no comparison with mrs brandon 
mrs dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage 
without attempting a removal to delaford and fortunately for 
sir john and mrs jennings when marianne was taken from them 
margaret had reached an age highly suitable for dancing 
and not very ineligible for being supposed to have a lover 
between barton and delaford there was that constant 
communication which strong family affection would 
naturally dictate and among the merits and the happiness 
of elinor and marianne let it not be ranked as the least 
considerable that though sisters and living almost within 
sight of each other they could live without disagreement 
between themselves or producing coolness between their husbands 
the end 
the king james bible 
the old testament of the king james bible 
the first book of moses called genesis 
in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth 
and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon 
the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the 
waters 
and god said let there be light and there was light 
and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light 
from the darkness 
and god called the light day and the darkness he called night 
and the evening and the morning were the first day 
and god said let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters 
and let it divide the waters from the waters 
and god made the firmament and divided the waters which were 
under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament 
and it was so 
and god called the firmament heaven and the evening and the 
morning were the second day 
and god said let the waters under the heaven be gathered together 
unto one place and let the dry land appear and it was so 
and god called the dry land earth and the gathering together of 
the waters called he seas and god saw that it was good 
and god said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding 
seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is 
in itself upon the earth and it was so 
and the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after 
his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after 
his kind and god saw that it was good 
and the evening and the morning were the third day 
and god said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven 
to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for 
seasons and for days and years and let them be for lights in 
the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth and it was 
so 
and god made two great lights the greater light to rule the day 
and the lesser light to rule the night he made the stars also 
and god set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light 
upon the earth and to rule over the day and over the night and 
to divide the light from the darkness and god saw that it was good 
and the evening and the morning were the fourth day 
and god said let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving 
creature that hath life and fowl that may fly above the earth in the 
open firmament of heaven 
and god created great whales and every living creature that 
moveth which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind 
and every winged fowl after his kind and god saw that it was good 
and god blessed them saying be fruitful and multiply and fill 
the waters in the seas and let fowl multiply in the earth 
and the evening and the morning were the fifth day 
and god said let the earth bring forth the living creature after 
his kind cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth after his 
kind and it was so 
and god made the beast of the earth after his kind and cattle 
after their kind and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after 
his kind and god saw that it was good 
and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness 
and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl 
of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over 
every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth 
so god created man in his own image in the image of god created 
he him male and female created he them 
and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and 
multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion 
over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every 
living thing that moveth upon the earth 
and god said behold i have given you every herb bearing seed 
which is upon the face of all the earth and every tree in the which 
is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall be for meat 
and to every beast of the earth and to every fowl of the air 
and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth wherein there is 
life i have given every green herb for meat and it was so 
and god saw every thing that he had made and behold it was 
very good and the evening and the morning were the sixth day 
thus the heavens and the earth were finished and all the host of 
them 
and on the seventh day god ended his work which he had made and 
he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made 
and god blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because that 
in it he had rested from all his work which god created and made 
these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when 
they were created in the day that the lord god made the earth and the 
heavens and every plant of the field before it was in the earth 
and every herb of the field before it grew for the lord god had not 
caused it to rain upon the earth and there was not a man to till the 
ground 
but there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole 
face of the ground 
and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and 
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living 
soul 
and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he 
put the man whom he had formed 
and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is 
pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the 
midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil 
and a river went out of eden to water the garden and from thence 
it was parted and became into four heads 
the name of the first is pison that is it which compasseth the 
whole land of havilah where there is gold and the gold of that 
land is good there is bdellium and the onyx stone 
and the name of the second river is gihon the same is it that 
compasseth the whole land of ethiopia 
and the name of the third river is hiddekel that is it which 
goeth toward the east of assyria and the fourth river is euphrates 
and the lord god took the man and put him into the garden of 
eden to dress it and to keep it 
and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the 
garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge 
of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou 
eatest thereof thou shalt surely die 
and the lord god said it is not good that the man should be 
alone i will make him an help meet for him 
and out of the ground the lord god formed every beast of the 
field and every fowl of the air and brought them unto adam to see 
what he would call them and whatsoever adam called every living 
creature that was the name thereof 
and adam gave names to all cattle and to the fowl of the air 
and to every beast of the field but for adam there was not found an 
help meet for him 
and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he 
slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead 
thereof and the rib which the lord god had taken from man made 
he a woman and brought her unto the man 
and adam said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my 
flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man 
therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall 
cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh 
and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not 
ashamed 
now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which 
the lord god had made and he said unto the woman yea hath god said 
ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said 
unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden 
but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden 
god hath said ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest 
ye die 
and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die 
for god doth know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall 
be opened and ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil 
and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that 
it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one 
wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto 
her husband with her and he did eat 
and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they 
were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves 
aprons 
and they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden in 
the cool of the day and adam and his wife hid themselves from the 
presence of the lord god amongst the trees of the garden 
and the lord god called unto adam and said unto him where art 
thou and he said i heard thy voice in the garden and i was 
afraid because i was naked and i hid myself 
and he said who told thee that thou wast naked hast thou eaten 
of the tree whereof i commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat 
and the man said the woman whom thou gavest to be with me she 
gave me of the tree and i did eat 
and the lord god said unto the woman what is this that thou hast 
done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and i did eat 
and the lord god said unto the serpent because thou hast done 
this thou art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the 
field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the 
days of thy life and i will put enmity between thee and the 
woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head 
and thou shalt bruise his heel 
unto the woman he said i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and 
thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thy 
desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee 
and unto adam he said because thou hast hearkened unto the voice 
of thy wife and hast eaten of the tree of which i commanded thee 
saying thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake 
in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life thorns 
also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat the 
herb of the field in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread 
till thou return unto the ground for out of it wast thou taken for 
dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou return 
and adam called his wife s name eve because she was the mother 
of all living 
unto adam also and to his wife did the lord god make coats of 
skins and clothed them 
and the lord god said behold the man is become as one of us to 
know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also 
of the tree of life and eat and live for ever therefore the 
lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden to till the ground 
from whence he was taken 
so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden 
of eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep 
the way of the tree of life 
and adam knew eve his wife and she conceived and bare cain and 
said i have gotten a man from the lord 
and she again bare his brother abel and abel was a keeper of 
sheep but cain was a tiller of the ground 
and in process of time it came to pass that cain brought of the 
fruit of the ground an offering unto the lord 
and abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of 
the fat thereof and the lord had respect unto abel and to his 
offering but unto cain and to his offering he had not respect 
and cain was very wroth and his countenance fell 
and the lord said unto cain why art thou wroth and why is thy 
countenance fallen if thou doest well shalt thou not be 
accepted and if thou doest not well sin lieth at the door and unto 
thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him 
and cain talked with abel his brother and it came to pass when 
they were in the field that cain rose up against abel his brother 
and slew him 
and the lord said unto cain where is abel thy brother and he 
said i know not am i my brother s keeper and he said what 
hast thou done the voice of thy brother s blood crieth unto me from 
the ground 
and now art thou cursed from the earth which hath opened her 
mouth to receive thy brother s blood from thy hand when thou 
tillest the ground it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her 
strength a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth 
and cain said unto the lord my punishment is greater than i can 
bear 
behold thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the 
earth and from thy face shall i be hid and i shall be a fugitive and 
a vagabond in the earth and it shall come to pass that every one 
that findeth me shall slay me 
and the lord said unto him therefore whosoever slayeth cain 
vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold and the lord set a mark 
upon cain lest any finding him should kill him 
and cain went out from the presence of the lord and dwelt in the 
land of nod on the east of eden 
and cain knew his wife and she conceived and bare enoch and he 
builded a city and called the name of the city after the name of his 
son enoch 
and unto enoch was born irad and irad begat mehujael and 
mehujael begat methusael and methusael begat lamech 
and lamech took unto him two wives the name of the one was adah 
and the name of the other zillah 
and adah bare jabal he was the father of such as dwell in tents 
and of such as have cattle 
and his brother s name was jubal he was the father of all such 
as handle the harp and organ 
and zillah she also bare tubalcain an instructer of every 
artificer in brass and iron and the sister of tubalcain was naamah 
and lamech said unto his wives adah and zillah hear my voice 
ye wives of lamech hearken unto my speech for i have slain a man to 
my wounding and a young man to my hurt 
if cain shall be avenged sevenfold truly lamech seventy and 
sevenfold 
and adam knew his wife again and she bare a son and called his 
name seth for god said she hath appointed me another seed instead 
of abel whom cain slew 
and to seth to him also there was born a son and he called his 
name enos then began men to call upon the name of the lord 
this is the book of the generations of adam in the day that god 
created man in the likeness of god made he him male and female 
created he them and blessed them and called their name adam in the 
day when they were created 
and adam lived an hundred and thirty years and begat a son in his 
own likeness and after his image and called his name seth and 
the days of adam after he had begotten seth were eight hundred years 
and he begat sons and daughters and all the days that adam lived 
were nine hundred and thirty years and he died 
and seth lived an hundred and five years and begat enos and 
seth lived after he begat enos eight hundred and seven years and 
begat sons and daughters and all the days of seth were nine 
hundred and twelve years and he died 
and enos lived ninety years and begat cainan and enos lived 
after he begat cainan eight hundred and fifteen years and begat sons 
and daughters and all the days of enos were nine hundred and 
five years and he died 
and cainan lived seventy years and begat mahalaleel and 
cainan lived after he begat mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years 
and begat sons and daughters and all the days of cainan were 
nine hundred and ten years and he died 
and mahalaleel lived sixty and five years and begat jared 
and mahalaleel lived after he begat jared eight hundred and thirty 
years and begat sons and daughters and all the days of 
mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years and he died 
and jared lived an hundred sixty and two years and he begat 
enoch and jared lived after he begat enoch eight hundred years 
and begat sons and daughters and all the days of jared were nine 
hundred sixty and two years and he died 
and enoch lived sixty and five years and begat methuselah 
and enoch walked with god after he begat methuselah three hundred 
years and begat sons and daughters and all the days of enoch 
were three hundred sixty and five years and enoch walked with 
god and he was not for god took him 
and methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years and begat 
lamech 
and methuselah lived after he begat lamech seven hundred eighty 
and two years and begat sons and daughters and all the days of 
methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years and he died 
and lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years and begat a 
son and he called his name noah saying this same shall comfort 
us concerning our work and toil of our hands because of the ground 
which the lord hath cursed 
and lamech lived after he begat noah five hundred ninety and five 
years and begat sons and daughters and all the days of lamech 
were seven hundred seventy and seven years and he died 
and noah was five hundred years old and noah begat shem ham 
and japheth 
and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the 
earth and daughters were born unto them that the sons of god saw 
the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of 
all which they chose 
and the lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for 
that he also is flesh yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty 
years 
there were giants in the earth in those days and also after that 
when the sons of god came in unto the daughters of men and they bare 
children to them the same became mighty men which were of old men of 
renown 
and god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and 
that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil 
continually 
and it repented the lord that he had made man on the earth and it 
grieved him at his heart 
and the lord said i will destroy man whom i have created from the 
face of the earth both man and beast and the creeping thing and 
the fowls of the air for it repenteth me that i have made them 
but noah found grace in the eyes of the lord 
these are the generations of noah noah was a just man and perfect 
in his generations and noah walked with god 
and noah begat three sons shem ham and japheth 
the earth also was corrupt before god and the earth was filled 
with violence 
and god looked upon the earth and behold it was corrupt for 
all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth 
and god said unto noah the end of all flesh is come before me 
for the earth is filled with violence through them and behold i 
will destroy them with the earth 
make thee an ark of gopher wood rooms shalt thou make in the 
ark and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch 
and this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of the length 
of the ark shall be three hundred cubits the breadth of it fifty 
cubits and the height of it thirty cubits 
a window shalt thou make to the ark and in a cubit shalt thou 
finish it above and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side 
thereof with lower second and third stories shalt thou make it 
and behold i even i do bring a flood of waters upon the 
earth to destroy all flesh wherein is the breath of life from under 
heaven and every thing that is in the earth shall die 
but with thee will i establish my covenant and thou shalt come 
into the ark thou and thy sons and thy wife and thy sons wives 
with thee 
and of every living thing of all flesh two of every sort shalt 
thou bring into the ark to keep them alive with thee they shall be 
male and female 
of fowls after their kind and of cattle after their kind of 
every creeping thing of the earth after his kind two of every sort 
shall come unto thee to keep them alive 
and take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten and thou shalt 
gather it to thee and it shall be for food for thee and for them 
thus did noah according to all that god commanded him so did 
he 
and the lord said unto noah come thou and all thy house into the 
ark for thee have i seen righteous before me in this generation 
of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens the male 
and his female and of beasts that are not clean by two the male and 
his female 
of fowls also of the air by sevens the male and the female to 
keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth 
for yet seven days and i will cause it to rain upon the earth 
forty days and forty nights and every living substance that i have 
made will i destroy from off the face of the earth 
and noah did according unto all that the lord commanded him 
and noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was 
upon the earth 
and noah went in and his sons and his wife and his sons wives 
with him into the ark because of the waters of the flood 
of clean beasts and of beasts that are not clean and of fowls 
and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth there went in two 
and two unto noah into the ark the male and the female as god had 
commanded noah 
and it came to pass after seven days that the waters of the 
flood were upon the earth 
in the six hundredth year of noah s life in the second month 
the seventeenth day of the month the same day were all the fountains 
of the great deep broken up and the windows of heaven were opened 
and the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights 
in the selfsame day entered noah and shem and ham and japheth 
the sons of noah and noah s wife and the three wives of his sons 
with them into the ark they and every beast after his kind 
and all the cattle after their kind and every creeping thing that 
creepeth upon the earth after his kind and every fowl after his kind 
every bird of every sort 
and they went in unto noah into the ark two and two of all 
flesh wherein is the breath of life 
and they that went in went in male and female of all flesh as 
god had commanded him and the lord shut him in 
and the flood was forty days upon the earth and the waters 
increased and bare up the ark and it was lift up above the earth 
and the waters prevailed and were increased greatly upon the 
earth and the ark went upon the face of the waters 
and the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth and all the 
high hills that were under the whole heaven were covered 
fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail and the mountains 
were covered 
and all flesh died that moved upon the earth both of fowl and 
of cattle and of beast and of every creeping thing that creepeth 
upon the earth and every man all in whose nostrils was the 
breath of life of all that was in the dry land died 
and every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face 
of the ground both man and cattle and the creeping things and the 
fowl of the heaven and they were destroyed from the earth and noah 
only remained alive and they that were with him in the ark 
and the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty 
days 
and god remembered noah and every living thing and all the 
cattle that was with him in the ark and god made a wind to pass over 
the earth and the waters asswaged the fountains also of the deep 
and the windows of heaven were stopped and the rain from heaven was 
restrained and the waters returned from off the earth 
continually and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the 
waters were abated 
and the ark rested in the seventh month on the seventeenth day of 
the month upon the mountains of ararat 
and the waters decreased continually until the tenth month in the 
tenth month on the first day of the month were the tops of the 
mountains seen 
and it came to pass at the end of forty days that noah opened the 
window of the ark which he had made and he sent forth a raven 
which went forth to and fro until the waters were dried up from off 
the earth 
also he sent forth a dove from him to see if the waters were 
abated from off the face of the ground but the dove found no rest 
for the sole of her foot and she returned unto him into the ark for 
the waters were on the face of the whole earth then he put forth his 
hand and took her and pulled her in unto him into the ark 
and he stayed yet other seven days and again he sent forth the 
dove out of the ark and the dove came in to him in the evening 
and lo in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off so noah knew that 
the waters were abated from off the earth 
and he stayed yet other seven days and sent forth the dove 
which returned not again unto him any more 
and it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year in the 
first month the first day of the month the waters were dried up from 
off the earth and noah removed the covering of the ark and looked 
and behold the face of the ground was dry 
and in the second month on the seven and twentieth day of the 
month was the earth dried 
and god spake unto noah saying go forth of the ark thou 
and thy wife and thy sons and thy sons wives with thee 
bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee of 
all flesh both of fowl and of cattle and of every creeping thing 
that creepeth upon the earth that they may breed abundantly in the 
earth and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth 
and noah went forth and his sons and his wife and his sons 
wives with him every beast every creeping thing and every 
fowl and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth after their kinds went 
forth out of the ark 
and noah builded an altar unto the lord and took of every clean 
beast and of every clean fowl and offered burnt offerings on the 
altar 
and the lord smelled a sweet savour and the lord said in his 
heart i will not again curse the ground any more for man s sake for 
the imagination of man s heart is evil from his youth neither will i 
again smite any more every thing living as i have done 
while the earth remaineth seedtime and harvest and cold and 
heat and summer and winter and day and night shall not cease 
and god blessed noah and his sons and said unto them be 
fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth 
and the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast 
of the earth and upon every fowl of the air upon all that moveth 
upon the earth and upon all the fishes of the sea into your hand are 
they delivered 
every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you even as the 
green herb have i given you all things 
but flesh with the life thereof which is the blood thereof shall 
ye not eat 
and surely your blood of your lives will i require at the hand of 
every beast will i require it and at the hand of man at the hand of 
every man s brother will i require the life of man 
whoso sheddeth man s blood by man shall his blood be she would for in 
the image of god made he man 
and you be ye fruitful and multiply bring forth abundantly in 
the earth and multiply therein 
and god spake unto noah and to his sons with him saying and 
i behold i establish my covenant with you and with your seed after 
you and with every living creature that is with you of the 
fowl of the cattle and of every beast of the earth with you from 
all that go out of the ark to every beast of the earth 
and i will establish my covenant with you neither shall all 
flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood neither shall 
there any more be a flood to destroy the earth 
and god said this is the token of the covenant which i make 
between me and you and every living creature that is with you for 
perpetual generations i do set my bow in the cloud and it shall 
be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth 
and it shall come to pass when i bring a cloud over the earth 
that the bow shall be seen in the cloud and i will remember my 
covenant which is between me and you and every living creature of all 
flesh and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all 
flesh 
and the bow shall be in the cloud and i will look upon it that 
i may remember the everlasting covenant between god and every living 
creature of all flesh that is upon the earth 
and god said unto noah this is the token of the covenant which 
i have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth 
and the sons of noah that went forth of the ark were shem and 
ham and japheth and ham is the father of canaan 
these are the three sons of noah and of them was the whole earth 
overspread 
and noah began to be an husbandman and he planted a vineyard 
and he drank of the wine and was drunken and he was uncovered 
within his tent 
and ham the father of canaan saw the nakedness of his father 
and told his two brethren without 
and shem and japheth took a garment and laid it upon both their 
shoulders and went backward and covered the nakedness of their 
father and their faces were backward and they saw not their father s 
nakedness 
and noah awoke from his wine and knew what his younger son had 
done unto him 
and he said cursed be canaan a servant of servants shall he be 
unto his brethren 
and he said blessed be the lord god of shem and canaan shall be 
his servant 
god shall enlarge japheth and he shall dwell in the tents of 
shem and canaan shall be his servant 
and noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years 
and all the days of noah were nine hundred and fifty years and 
he died 
now these are the generations of the sons of noah shem ham and 
japheth and unto them were sons born after the flood 
the sons of japheth gomer and magog and madai and javan and 
tubal and meshech and tiras 
and the sons of gomer ashkenaz and riphath and togarmah 
and the sons of javan elishah and tarshish kittim and 
dodanim 
by these were the isles of the gentiles divided in their lands 
every one after his tongue after their families in their nations 
and the sons of ham cush and mizraim and phut and canaan 
and the sons of cush seba and havilah and sabtah and raamah 
and sabtechah and the sons of raamah sheba and dedan 
and cush begat nimrod he began to be a mighty one in the earth 
he was a mighty hunter before the lord wherefore it is said 
even as nimrod the mighty hunter before the lord 
and the beginning of his kingdom was babel and erech and 
accad and calneh in the land of shinar 
out of that land went forth asshur and builded nineveh and the 
city rehoboth and calah and resen between nineveh and calah 
the same is a great city 
and mizraim begat ludim and anamim and lehabim and naphtuhim 
and pathrusim and casluhim out of whom came philistim and 
caphtorim 
and canaan begat sidon his first born and heth and the 
jebusite and the amorite and the girgasite and the hivite 
and the arkite and the sinite and the arvadite and the 
zemarite and the hamathite and afterward were the families of the 
canaanites spread abroad 
and the border of the canaanites was from sidon as thou comest 
to gerar unto gaza as thou goest unto sodom and gomorrah and 
admah and zeboim even unto lasha 
these are the sons of ham after their families after their 
tongues in their countries and in their nations 
unto shem also the father of all the children of eber the 
brother of japheth the elder even to him were children born 
the children of shem elam and asshur and arphaxad and lud 
and aram 
and the children of aram uz and hul and gether and mash 
and arphaxad begat salah and salah begat eber 
and unto eber were born two sons the name of one was peleg for 
in his days was the earth divided and his brother s name was joktan 
and joktan begat almodad and sheleph and hazarmaveth and 
jerah and hadoram and uzal and diklah and obal and 
abimael and sheba and ophir and havilah and jobab all these 
were the sons of joktan 
and their dwelling was from mesha as thou goest unto sephar a 
mount of the east 
these are the sons of shem after their families after their 
tongues in their lands after their nations 
these are the families of the sons of noah after their 
generations in their nations and by these were the nations divided 
in the earth after the flood 
and the whole earth was of one language and of one speech 
and it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that they 
found a plain in the land of shinar and they dwelt there 
and they said one to another go to let us make brick and burn 
them thoroughly and they had brick for stone and slime had they for 
morter 
and they said go to let us build us a city and a tower whose 
top may reach unto heaven and let us make us a name lest we be 
scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth 
and the lord came down to see the city and the tower which the 
children of men builded 
and the lord said behold the people is one and they have all 
one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will be 
restrained from them which they have imagined to do 
go to let us go down and there confound their language that 
they may not understand one another s speech 
so the lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of 
all the earth and they left off to build the city 
therefore is the name of it called babel because the lord did 
there confound the language of all the earth and from thence did the 
lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth 
these are the generations of shem shem was an hundred years 
old and begat arphaxad two years after the flood and shem 
lived after he begat arphaxad five hundred years and begat sons and 
daughters 
and arphaxad lived five and thirty years and begat salah 
and arphaxad lived after he begat salah four hundred and three years 
and begat sons and daughters 
and salah lived thirty years and begat eber and salah 
lived after he begat eber four hundred and three years and begat sons 
and daughters 
and eber lived four and thirty years and begat peleg and 
eber lived after he begat peleg four hundred and thirty years and 
begat sons and daughters 
and peleg lived thirty years and begat reu and peleg 
lived after he begat reu two hundred and nine years and begat sons 
and daughters 
and reu lived two and thirty years and begat serug and 
reu lived after he begat serug two hundred and seven years and begat 
sons and daughters 
and serug lived thirty years and begat nahor and serug 
lived after he begat nahor two hundred years and begat sons and 
daughters 
and nahor lived nine and twenty years and begat terah 
and nahor lived after he begat terah an hundred and nineteen years 
and begat sons and daughters 
and terah lived seventy years and begat abram nahor and 
haran 
now these are the generations of terah terah begat abram 
nahor and haran and haran begat lot 
and haran died before his father terah in the land of his 
nativity in you are of the chaldees 
and abram and nahor took them wives the name of abram s wife 
was sarai and the name of nahor s wife milcah the daughter of 
haran the father of milcah and the father of iscah 
but sarai was barren she had no child 
and terah took abram his son and lot the son of haran his son s 
son and sarai his daughter in law his son abram s wife and they 
went forth with them from you are of the chaldees to go into the land of 
canaan and they came unto haran and dwelt there 
and the days of terah were two hundred and five years and terah 
died in haran 
now the lord had said unto abram get thee out of thy country 
and from thy kindred and from thy father s house unto a land that i 
will shew thee and i will make of thee a great nation and i 
will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a 
blessing and i will bless them that bless thee and curse him 
that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be 
blessed 
so abram departed as the lord had spoken unto him and lot went 
with him and abram was seventy and five years old when he departed 
out of haran 
and abram took sarai his wife and lot his brother s son and all 
their substance that they had gathered and the souls that they had 
gotten in haran and they went forth to go into the land of canaan 
and into the land of canaan they came 
and abram passed through the land unto the place of sichem unto 
the plain of moreh and the canaanite was then in the land 
and the lord appeared unto abram and said unto thy seed will i 
give this land and there builded he an altar unto the lord who 
appeared unto him 
and he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of bethel 
and pitched his tent having bethel on the west and hai on the east 
and there he builded an altar unto the lord and called upon the name 
of the lord 
and abram journeyed going on still toward the south 
and there was a famine in the land and abram went down into 
egypt to sojourn there for the famine was grievous in the land 
and it came to pass when he was come near to enter into egypt 
that he said unto sarai his wife behold now i know that thou art a 
fair woman to look upon therefore it shall come to pass when 
the egyptians shall see thee that they shall say this is his wife 
and they will kill me but they will save thee alive 
say i pray thee thou art my sister that it may be well with 
me for thy sake and my soul shall live because of thee 
and it came to pass that when abram was come into egypt the 
egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair 
the princes also of pharaoh saw her and commended her before 
pharaoh and the woman was taken into pharaoh s house 
and he entreated abram well for her sake and he had sheep and 
oxen and he asses and menservants and maidservants and she asses 
and camels 
and the lord plagued pharaoh and his house with great plagues 
because of sarai abram s wife 
and pharaoh called abram and said what is this that thou hast 
done unto me why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife 
why saidst thou she is my sister so i might have taken her to me to 
wife now therefore behold thy wife take her and go thy way 
and pharaoh commanded his men concerning him and they sent him 
away and his wife and all that he had 
and abram went up out of egypt he and his wife and all that he 
had and lot with him into the south 
and abram was very rich in cattle in silver and in gold 
and he went on his journeys from the south even to bethel unto 
the place where his tent had been at the beginning between bethel and 
hai unto the place of the altar which he had make there at the 
first and there abram called on the name of the lord 
and lot also which went with abram had flocks and herds and 
tents 
and the land was not able to bear them that they might dwell 
together for their substance was great so that they could not dwell 
together 
and there was a strife between the herdmen of abram s cattle and 
the herdmen of lot s cattle and the canaanite and the perizzite 
dwelled then in the land 
and abram said unto lot let there be no strife i pray thee 
between me and thee and between my herdmen and thy herdmen for we be 
brethren 
is not the whole land before thee separate thyself i pray thee 
from me if thou wilt take the left hand then i will go to the right 
or if thou depart to the right hand then i will go to the left 
and lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of jordan 
that it was well watered every where before the lord destroyed sodom 
and gomorrah even as the garden of the lord like the land of egypt 
as thou comest unto zoar 
then lot chose him all the plain of jordan and lot journeyed 
east and they separated themselves the one from the other 
abram dwelled in the land of canaan and lot dwelled in the 
cities of the plain and pitched his tent toward sodom 
but the men of sodom were wicked and sinners before the lord 
exceedingly 
and the lord said unto abram after that lot was separated from 
him lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art 
northward and southward and eastward and westward for all 
the land which thou seest to thee will i give it and to thy seed for 
ever 
and i will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a 
man can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed also be 
numbered 
arise walk through the land in the length of it and in the 
breadth of it for i will give it unto thee 
then abram removed his tent and came and dwelt in the plain of 
mamre which is in hebron and built there an altar unto the lord 
and it came to pass in the days of amraphel king of shinar 
arioch king of ellasar chedorlaomer king of elam and tidal king of 
nations that these made war with bera king of sodom and with 
birsha king of gomorrah shinab king of admah and shemeber king of 
zeboiim and the king of bela which is zoar 
all these were joined together in the vale of siddim which is 
the salt sea 
twelve years they served chedorlaomer and in the thirteenth year 
they rebelled 
and in the fourteenth year came chedorlaomer and the kings that 
were with him and smote the rephaims in ashteroth karnaim and the 
zuzims in ham and the emins in shaveh kiriathaim and the 
horites in their mount seir unto elparan which is by the wilderness 
and they returned and came to enmishpat which is kadesh and 
smote all the country of the amalekites and also the amorites that 
dwelt in hazezontamar 
and there went out the king of sodom and the king of gomorrah 
and the king of admah and the king of zeboiim and the king of bela 
the same is zoar and they joined battle with them in the vale of 
siddim with chedorlaomer the king of elam and with tidal king 
of nations and amraphel king of shinar and arioch king of ellasar 
four kings with five 
and the vale of siddim was full of slimepits and the kings of 
sodom and gomorrah fled and fell there and they that remained fled 
to the mountain 
and they took all the goods of sodom and gomorrah and all their 
victuals and went their way 
and they took lot abram s brother s son who dwelt in sodom 
and his goods and departed 
and there came one that had escaped and told abram the hebrew 
for he dwelt in the plain of mamre the amorite brother of eshcol and 
brother of aner and these were confederate with abram 
and when abram heard that his brother was taken captive he 
armed his trained servants born in his own house three hundred and 
eighteen and pursued them unto dan 
and he divided himself against them he and his servants by 
night and smote them and pursued them unto hobah which is on the 
left hand of damascus 
and he brought back all the goods and also brought again his 
brother lot and his goods and the women also and the people 
and the king of sodom went out to meet him after his return from 
the slaughter of chedorlaomer and of the kings that were with him at 
the valley of shaveh which is the king s dale 
and melchizedek king of salem brought forth bread and wine and 
he was the priest of the most high god 
and he blessed him and said blessed be abram of the most high 
god possessor of heaven and earth and blessed be the most high 
god which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand and he gave him 
tithes of all 
and the king of sodom said unto abram give me the persons and 
take the goods to thyself 
and abram said to the king of sodom i have lift up mine hand 
unto the lord the most high god the possessor of heaven and earth 
that i will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet and 
that i will not take any thing that is thine lest thou shouldest say 
i have made abram rich save only that which the young men have 
eaten and the portion of the men which went with me aner eshcol 
and mamre let them take their portion 
after these things the word of the lord came unto abram in a 
vision saying fear not abram i am thy shield and thy exceeding 
great reward 
and abram said lord god what wilt thou give me seeing i go 
childless and the steward of my house is this eliezer of damascus 
and abram said behold to me thou hast given no seed and lo 
one born in my house is mine heir 
and behold the word of the lord came unto him saying this 
shall not be thine heir but he that shall come forth out of thine own 
bowels shall be thine heir 
and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward 
heaven and tell the stars if thou be able to number them and he 
said unto him so shall thy seed be 
and he believed in the lord and he counted it to him for 
righteousness 
and he said unto him i am the lord that brought thee out of you are 
of the chaldees to give thee this land to inherit it 
and he said lord god whereby shall i know that i shall inherit 
it and he said unto him take me an heifer of three years old 
and a she goat of three years old and a ram of three years old and a 
turtledove and a young pigeon 
and he took unto him all these and divided them in the midst 
and laid each piece one against another but the birds divided he not 
and when the fowls came down upon the carcases abram drove them 
away 
and when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon abram 
and lo an horror of great darkness fell upon him 
and he said unto abram know of a surety that thy seed shall be 
a stranger in a land that is not their s and shall serve them and 
they shall afflict them four hundred years and also that 
nation whom they shall serve will i judge and afterward shall they 
come out with great substance 
and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace thou shalt be buried 
in a good old age 
but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for 
the iniquity of the amorites is not yet full 
and it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was 
dark behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed between 
those pieces 
in the same day the lord made a covenant with abram saying 
unto thy seed have i given this land from the river of egypt unto the 
great river the river euphrates the kenites and the 
kenizzites and the kadmonites and the hittites and the 
perizzites and the rephaims and the amorites and the 
canaanites and the girgashites and the jebusites 
now sarai abram s wife bare him no children and she had an 
handmaid an egyptian whose name was hagar 
and sarai said unto abram behold now the lord hath restrained 
me from bearing i pray thee go in unto my maid it may be that i may 
obtain children by her and abram hearkened to the voice of sarai 
and sarai abram s wife took hagar her maid the egyptian after 
abram had dwelt ten years in the land of canaan and gave her to her 
husband abram to be his wife 
and he went in unto hagar and she conceived and when she saw 
that she had conceived her mistress was despised in her eyes 
and sarai said unto abram my wrong be upon thee i have given my 
maid into thy bosom and when she saw that she had conceived i was 
despised in her eyes the lord judge between me and thee 
but abram said unto sarai behold thy maid is in thine hand do 
to her as it pleaseth thee and when sarai dealt hardly with her she 
fled from her face 
and the angel of the lord found her by a fountain of water in the 
wilderness by the fountain in the way to shur 
and he said hagar sarai s maid whence camest thou and whither 
wilt thou go and she said i flee from the face of my mistress sarai 
and the angel of the lord said unto her return to thy mistress 
and submit thyself under her hands 
and the angel of the lord said unto her i will multiply thy 
seed exceedingly that it shall not be numbered for multitude 
and the angel of the lord said unto her behold thou art with 
child and shalt bear a son and shalt call his name ishmael because 
the lord hath heard thy affliction 
and he will be a wild man his hand will be against every man 
and every man s hand against him and he shall dwell in the presence 
of all his brethren 
and she called the name of the lord that spake unto her thou 
god seest me for she said have i also here looked after him that 
seeth me wherefore the well was called beerlahairoi behold 
it is between kadesh and bered 
and hagar bare abram a son and abram called his son s name 
which hagar bare ishmael 
and abram was fourscore and six years old when hagar bare 
ishmael to abram 
and when abram was ninety years old and nine the lord appeared 
to abram and said unto him i am the almighty god walk before me 
and be thou perfect 
and i will make my covenant between me and thee and will 
multiply thee exceedingly 
and abram fell on his face and god talked with him saying 
as for me behold my covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a 
father of many nations 
neither shall thy name any more be called abram but thy name 
shall be abraham for a father of many nations have i made thee 
and i will make thee exceeding fruitful and i will make nations 
of thee and kings shall come out of thee 
and i will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed 
after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant to be a 
god unto thee and to thy seed after thee 
and i will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the land 
wherein thou art a stranger all the land of canaan for an 
everlasting possession and i will be their god 
and god said unto abraham thou shalt keep my covenant therefore 
thou and thy seed after thee in their generations 
this is my covenant which ye shall keep between me and you and 
thy seed after thee every man child among you shall be circumcised 
and ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin and it shall 
be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you 
and he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you 
every man child in your generations he that is born in the house or 
bought with money of any stranger which is not of thy seed 
he that is born in thy house and he that is bought with thy 
money must needs be circumcised and my covenant shall be in your 
flesh for an everlasting covenant 
and the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is 
not circumcised that soul shall be cut off from his people he hath 
broken my covenant 
and god said unto abraham as for sarai thy wife thou shalt not 
call her name sarai but sarah shall her name be 
and i will bless her and give thee a son also of her yea i 
will bless her and she shall be a mother of nations kings of people 
shall be of her 
then abraham fell upon his face and laughed and said in his 
heart shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old 
and shall sarah that is ninety years old bear and abraham 
said unto god o that ishmael might live before thee and god 
said sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed and thou shalt call 
his name isaac and i will establish my covenant with him for an 
everlasting covenant and with his seed after him 
and as for ishmael i have heard thee behold i have blessed 
him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly 
twelve princes shall he beget and i will make him a great nation 
but my covenant will i establish with isaac which sarah shall 
bear unto thee at this set time in the next year 
and he left off talking with him and god went up from abraham 
and abraham took ishmael his son and all that were born in his 
house and all that were bought with his money every male among the 
men of abraham s house and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in 
the selfsame day as god had said unto him 
and abraham was ninety years old and nine when he was 
circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin 
and ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was 
circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin 
in the selfsame day was abraham circumcised and ishmael his 
son 
and all the men of his house born in the house and bought with 
money of the stranger were circumcised with him 
and the lord appeared unto him in the plains of mamre and he sat 
in the tent door in the heat of the day and he lift up his eyes 
and looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw them he 
ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the 
ground and said my lord if now i have found favour in thy 
sight pass not away i pray thee from thy servant let a little 
water i pray you be fetched and wash your feet and rest yourselves 
under the tree and i will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort 
ye your hearts after that ye shall pass on for therefore are ye come 
to your servant and they said so do as thou hast said 
and abraham hastened into the tent unto sarah and said make 
ready quickly three measures of fine meal knead it and make cakes 
upon the hearth 
and abraham ran unto the herd and fetcht a calf tender and good 
and gave it unto a young man and he hasted to dress it 
and he took butter and milk and the calf which he had dressed 
and set it before them and he stood by them under the tree and they 
did eat 
and they said unto him where is sarah thy wife and he said 
behold in the tent 
and he said i will certainly return unto thee according to the 
time of life and lo sarah thy wife shall have a son and sarah 
heard it in the tent door which was behind him 
now abraham and sarah were old and well stricken in age and it 
ceased to be with sarah after the manner of women 
therefore sarah laughed within herself saying after i am waxed 
old shall i have pleasure my lord being old also and the lord 
said unto abraham wherefore did sarah laugh saying shall i of a 
surety bear a child which am old is any thing too hard for 
the lord at the time appointed i will return unto thee according to 
the time of life and sarah shall have a son 
then sarah denied saying i laughed not for she was afraid 
and he said nay but thou didst laugh 
and the men rose up from thence and looked toward sodom and 
abraham went with them to bring them on the way 
and the lord said shall i hide from abraham that thing which i 
do seeing that abraham shall surely become a great and mighty 
nation and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him 
for i know him that he will command his children and his 
household after him and they shall keep the way of the lord to do 
justice and judgment that the lord may bring upon abraham that which 
he hath spoken of him 
and the lord said because the cry of sodom and gomorrah is 
great and because their sin is very grievous i will go down 
now and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of 
it which is come unto me and if not i will know 
and the men turned their faces from thence and went toward 
sodom but abraham stood yet before the lord 
and abraham drew near and said wilt thou also destroy the 
righteous with the wicked peradventure there be fifty 
righteous within the city wilt thou also destroy and not spare the 
place for the fifty righteous that are therein that be far 
from thee to do after this manner to slay the righteous with the 
wicked and that the righteous should be as the wicked that be far 
from thee shall not the judge of all the earth do right and 
the lord said if i find in sodom fifty righteous within the city 
then i will spare all the place for their sakes 
and abraham answered and said behold now i have taken upon me 
to speak unto the lord which am but dust and ashes 
peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous wilt thou 
destroy all the city for lack of five and he said if i find there 
forty and five i will not destroy it 
and he spake unto him yet again and said peradventure there 
shall be forty found there and he said i will not do it for forty s 
sake 
and he said unto him oh let not the lord be angry and i will 
speak peradventure there shall thirty be found there and he said i 
will not do it if i find thirty there 
and he said behold now i have taken upon me to speak unto the 
lord peradventure there shall be twenty found there and he said i 
will not destroy it for twenty s sake 
and he said oh let not the lord be angry and i will speak yet 
but this once peradventure ten shall be found there and he said i 
will not destroy it for ten s sake 
and the lord went his way as soon as he had left communing with 
abraham and abraham returned unto his place 
and there came two angels to sodom at even and lot sat in the 
gate of sodom and lot seeing them rose up to meet them and he bowed 
himself with his face toward the ground and he said behold now 
my lords turn in i pray you into your servant s house and tarry 
all night and wash your feet and ye shall rise up early and go on 
your ways and they said nay but we will abide in the street all 
night 
and he pressed upon them greatly and they turned in unto him 
and entered into his house and he made them a feast and did bake 
unleavened bread and they did eat 
but before they lay down the men of the city even the men of 
sodom compassed the house round both old and young all the people 
from every quarter and they called unto lot and said unto him 
where are the men which came in to thee this night bring them out 
unto us that we may know them 
and lot went out at the door unto them and shut the door after 
him and said i pray you brethren do not so wickedly 
behold now i have two daughters which have not known man let 
me i pray you bring them out unto you and do ye to them as is good 
in your eyes only unto these men do nothing for therefore came they 
under the shadow of my roof 
and they said stand back and they said again this one fellow 
came in to sojourn and he will needs be a judge now will we deal 
worse with thee than with them and they pressed sore upon the man 
even lot and came near to break the door 
but the men put forth their hand and pulled lot into the house 
to them and shut to the door 
and they smote the men that were at the door of the house with 
blindness both small and great so that they wearied themselves to 
find the door 
and the men said unto lot hast thou here any besides son in 
law and thy sons and thy daughters and whatsoever thou hast in the 
city bring them out of this place for we will destroy this 
place because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the 
lord and the lord hath sent us to destroy it 
and lot went out and spake unto his sons in law which married 
his daughters and said up get you out of this place for the lord 
will destroy this city but he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons 
in law 
and when the morning arose then the angels hastened lot 
saying arise take thy wife and thy two daughters which are here 
lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city 
and while he lingered the men laid hold upon his hand and upon 
the hand of his wife and upon the hand of his two daughters the lord 
being merciful unto him and they brought him forth and set him 
without the city 
and it came to pass when they had brought them forth abroad 
that he said escape for thy life look not behind thee neither stay 
thou in all the plain escape to the mountain lest thou be consumed 
and lot said unto them oh not so my lord behold now 
thy servant hath found grace in thy sight and thou hast magnified thy 
mercy which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life and i cannot 
escape to the mountain lest some evil take me and i die 
behold now this city is near to flee unto and it is a little one 
oh let me escape thither is it not a little one and my soul shall 
live 
and he said unto him see i have accepted thee concerning this 
thing also that i will not overthrow this city for the which thou 
hast spoken 
haste thee escape thither for i cannot do anything till thou 
be come thither therefore the name of the city was called zoar 
the sun was risen upon the earth when lot entered into zoar 
then the lord rained upon sodom and upon gomorrah brimstone and 
fire from the lord out of heaven and he overthrew those cities 
and all the plain and all the inhabitants of the cities and that 
which grew upon the ground 
but his wife looked back from behind him and she became a 
pillar of salt 
and abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he 
stood before the lord and he looked toward sodom and gomorrah 
and toward all the land of the plain and beheld and lo the smoke 
of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace 
and it came to pass when god destroyed the cities of the plain 
that god remembered abraham and sent lot out of the midst of the 
overthrow when he overthrew the cities in the which lot dwelt 
and lot went up out of zoar and dwelt in the mountain and his 
two daughters with him for he feared to dwell in zoar and he dwelt 
in a cave he and his two daughters 
and the firstborn said unto the younger our father is old and 
there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of 
all the earth come let us make our father drink wine and we 
will lie with him that we may preserve seed of our father 
and they made their father drink wine that night and the 
firstborn went in and lay with her father and he perceived not when 
she lay down nor when she arose 
and it came to pass on the morrow that the firstborn said unto 
the younger behold i lay yesternight with my father let us make him 
drink wine this night also and go thou in and lie with him that we 
may preserve seed of our father 
and they made their father drink wine that night also and the 
younger arose and lay with him and he perceived not when she lay 
down nor when she arose 
thus were both the daughters of lot with child by their father 
and the first born bare a son and called his name moab the 
same is the father of the moabites unto this day 
and the younger she also bare a son and called his name 
benammi the same is the father of the children of ammon unto this 
day 
and abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country and 
dwelled between kadesh and shur and sojourned in gerar 
and abraham said of sarah his wife she is my sister and 
abimelech king of gerar sent and took sarah 
but god came to abimelech in a dream by night and said to him 
behold thou art but a dead man for the woman which thou hast taken 
for she is a man s wife 
but abimelech had not come near her and he said lord wilt thou 
slay also a righteous nation said he not unto me she is my 
sister and she even she herself said he is my brother in the 
integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have i done this 
and god said unto him in a dream yea i know that thou didst 
this in the integrity of thy heart for i also withheld thee from 
sinning against me therefore suffered i thee not to touch her 
now therefore restore the man his wife for he is a prophet and 
he shall pray for thee and thou shalt live and if thou restore her 
not know thou that thou shalt surely die thou and all that are 
thine 
therefore abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his 
servants and told all these things in their ears and the men were 
sore afraid 
then abimelech called abraham and said unto him what hast thou 
done unto us and what have i offended thee that thou hast brought on 
me and on my kingdom a great sin thou hast done deeds unto me that 
ought not to be done 
and abimelech said unto abraham what sawest thou that thou 
hast done this thing and abraham said because i thought 
surely the fear of god is not in this place and they will slay me for 
my wife s sake 
and yet indeed she is my sister she is the daughter of my 
father but not the daughter of my mother and she became my wife 
and it came to pass when god caused me to wander from my 
father s house that i said unto her this is thy kindness which thou 
shalt shew unto me at every place whither we shall come say of me 
he is my brother 
and abimelech took sheep and oxen and menservants and 
womenservants and gave them unto abraham and restored him sarah his 
wife 
and abimelech said behold my land is before thee dwell where 
it pleaseth thee 
and unto sarah he said behold i have given thy brother a 
thousand pieces of silver behold he is to thee a covering of the 
eyes unto all that are with thee and with all other thus she was 
reproved 
so abraham prayed unto god and god healed abimelech and his 
wife and his maidservants and they bare children 
for the lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of 
abimelech because of sarah abraham s wife 
and the lord visited sarah as he had said and the lord did unto 
sarah as he had spoken 
for sarah conceived and bare abraham a son in his old age at 
the set time of which god had spoken to him 
and abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him 
whom sarah bare to him isaac 
and abraham circumcised his son isaac being eight days old as 
god had commanded him 
and abraham was an hundred years old when his son isaac was born 
unto him 
and sarah said god hath made me to laugh so that all that hear 
will laugh with me 
and she said who would have said unto abraham that sarah should 
have given children suck for i have born him a son in his old age 
and the child grew and was weaned and abraham made a great 
feast the same day that isaac was weaned 
and sarah saw the son of hagar the egyptian which she had born 
unto abraham mocking 
wherefore she said unto abraham cast out this bondwoman and her 
son for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son even 
with isaac 
and the thing was very grievous in abraham s sight because of 
his son 
and god said unto abraham let it not be grievous in thy sight 
because of the lad and because of thy bondwoman in all that sarah 
hath said unto thee hearken unto her voice for in isaac shall thy 
seed be called 
and also of the son of the bondwoman will i make a nation 
because he is thy seed 
and abraham rose up early in the morning and took bread and a 
bottle of water and gave it unto hagar putting it on her shoulder 
and the child and sent her away and she departed and wandered in 
the wilderness of beersheba 
and the water was spent in the bottle and she cast the child 
under one of the shrubs 
and she went and sat her down over against him a good way off 
as it were a bow shot for she said let me not see the death of the 
child and she sat over against him and lift up her voice and wept 
and god heard the voice of the lad and the angel of god called 
to hagar out of heaven and said unto her what aileth thee hagar 
fear not for god hath heard the voice of the lad where he is 
arise lift up the lad and hold him in thine hand for i will 
make him a great nation 
and god opened her eyes and she saw a well of water and she 
went and filled the bottle with water and gave the lad drink 
and god was with the lad and he grew and dwelt in the 
wilderness and became an archer 
and he dwelt in the wilderness of paran and his mother took him 
a wife out of the land of egypt 
and it came to pass at that time that abimelech and phichol the 
chief captain of his host spake unto abraham saying god is with thee 
in all that thou doest now therefore swear unto me here by god 
that thou wilt not deal falsely with me nor with my son nor with my 
son s son but according to the kindness that i have done unto thee 
thou shalt do unto me and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned 
and abraham said i will swear 
and abraham reproved abimelech because of a well of water which 
abimelech s servants had violently taken away 
and abimelech said i wot not who hath done this thing neither 
didst thou tell me neither yet heard i of it but to day 
and abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them unto abimelech 
and both of them made a covenant 
and abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves 
and abimelech said unto abraham what mean these seven ewe lambs 
which thou hast set by themselves and he said for these seven 
ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand that they may be a witness unto 
me that i have digged this well 
wherefore he called that place beersheba because there they 
sware both of them 
thus they made a covenant at beersheba then abimelech rose up 
and phichol the chief captain of his host and they returned into the 
land of the philistines 
and abraham planted a grove in beersheba and called there on 
the name of the lord the everlasting god 
and abraham sojourned in the philistines land many days 
and it came to pass after these things that god did tempt 
abraham and said unto him abraham and he said behold here i am 
and he said take now thy son thine only son isaac whom thou 
lovest and get thee into the land of moriah and offer him there for 
a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which i will tell thee of 
and abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass 
and took two of his young men with him and isaac his son and clave 
the wood for the burnt offering and rose up and went unto the place 
of which god had told him 
then on the third day abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the 
place afar off 
and abraham said unto his young men abide ye here with the ass 
and i and the lad will go yonder and worship and come again to you 
and abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon 
isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they 
went both of them together 
and isaac spake unto abraham his father and said my father and 
he said here am i my son and he said behold the fire and the wood 
but where is the lamb for a burnt offering and abraham said my 
son god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they 
went both of them together 
and they came to the place which god had told him of and abraham 
built an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound isaac his 
son and laid him on the altar upon the wood 
and abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay 
his son 
and the angel of the lord called unto him out of heaven and 
said abraham abraham and he said here am i 
and he said lay not thine hand upon the lad neither do thou 
any thing unto him for now i know that thou fearest god seeing thou 
hast not withheld thy son thine only son from me 
and abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind 
him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns and abraham went and took 
the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his 
son 
and abraham called the name of that place jehovahjireh as it is 
said to this day in the mount of the lord it shall be seen 
and the angel of the lord called unto abraham out of heaven the 
second time and said by myself have i sworn saith the lord 
for because thou hast done this thing and hast not withheld thy son 
thine only son that in blessing i will bless thee and in 
multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and 
as the sand which is upon the sea shore and thy seed shall possess 
the gate of his enemies and in thy seed shall all the nations 
of the earth be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voice 
so abraham returned unto his young men and they rose up and 
went together to beersheba and abraham dwelt at beersheba 
and it came to pass after these things that it was told 
abraham saying behold milcah she hath also born children unto thy 
brother nahor huz his firstborn and buz his brother and 
kemuel the father of aram and chesed and hazo and pildash 
and jidlaph and bethuel 
and bethuel begat rebekah these eight milcah did bear to nahor 
abraham s brother 
and his concubine whose name was reumah she bare also tebah 
and gaham and thahash and maachah 
and sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old these 
were the years of the life of sarah 
and sarah died in kirjatharba the same is hebron in the land of 
canaan and abraham came to mourn for sarah and to weep for her 
and abraham stood up from before his dead and spake unto the 
sons of heth saying i am a stranger and a sojourner with you 
give me a possession of a buryingplace with you that i may bury my 
dead out of my sight 
and the children of heth answered abraham saying unto him 
hear us my lord thou art a mighty prince among us in the choice of 
our sepulchres bury thy dead none of us shall withhold from thee his 
sepulchre but that thou mayest bury thy dead 
and abraham stood up and bowed himself to the people of the 
land even to the children of heth 
and he communed with them saying if it be your mind that i 
should bury my dead out of my sight hear me and intreat for me to 
ephron the son of zohar that he may give me the cave of 
machpelah which he hath which is in the end of his field for as 
much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a 
buryingplace amongst you 
and ephron dwelt among the children of heth and ephron the 
hittite answered abraham in the audience of the children of heth even 
of all that went in at the gate of his city saying nay my 
lord hear me the field give i thee and the cave that is therein i 
give it thee in the presence of the sons of my people give i it thee 
bury thy dead 
and abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land 
and he spake unto ephron in the audience of the people of the 
land saying but if thou wilt give it i pray thee hear me i will 
give thee money for the field take it of me and i will bury my dead 
there 
and ephron answered abraham saying unto him my lord 
hearken unto me the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver 
what is that betwixt me and thee bury therefore thy dead 
and abraham hearkened unto ephron and abraham weighed to ephron 
the silver which he had named in the audience of the sons of heth 
four hundred shekels of silver current money with the merchant 
and the field of ephron which was in machpelah which was before 
mamre the field and the cave which was therein and all the trees 
that were in the field that were in all the borders round about were 
made sure unto abraham for a possession in the presence of the 
children of heth before all that went in at the gate of his city 
and after this abraham buried sarah his wife in the cave of the 
field of machpelah before mamre the same is hebron in the land of 
canaan 
and the field and the cave that is therein were made sure unto 
abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of heth 
and abraham was old and well stricken in age and the lord had 
blessed abraham in all things 
and abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house that ruled 
over all that he had put i pray thee thy hand under my thigh 
and i will make thee swear by the lord the god of heaven and the god 
of the earth that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the 
daughters of the canaanites among whom i dwell but thou shalt 
go unto my country and to my kindred and take a wife unto my son 
isaac 
and the servant said unto him peradventure the woman will not be 
willing to follow me unto this land must i needs bring thy son again 
unto the land from whence thou camest and abraham said unto 
him beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again 
the lord god of heaven which took me from my father s house and 
from the land of my kindred and which spake unto me and that sware 
unto me saying unto thy seed will i give this land he shall send 
his angel before thee and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from 
thence 
and if the woman will not be willing to follow thee then thou 
shalt be clear from this my oath only bring not my son thither again 
and the servant put his hand under the thigh of abraham his 
master and sware to him concerning that matter 
and the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master and 
departed for all the goods of his master were in his hand and he 
arose and went to mesopotamia unto the city of nahor 
and he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well 
of water at the time of the evening even the time that women go out 
to draw water 
and he said o lord god of my master abraham i pray thee send 
me good speed this day and shew kindness unto my master abraham 
behold i stand here by the well of water and the daughters of 
the men of the city come out to draw water and let it come to 
pass that the damsel to whom i shall say let down thy pitcher i 
pray thee that i may drink and she shall say drink and i will give 
thy camels drink also let the same be she that thou hast appointed 
for thy servant isaac and thereby shall i know that thou hast shewed 
kindness unto my master 
and it came to pass before he had done speaking that behold 
rebekah came out who was born to bethuel son of milcah the wife of 
nahor abraham s brother with her pitcher upon her shoulder 
and the damsel was very fair to look upon a virgin neither had 
any man known her and she went down to the well and filled her 
pitcher and came up 
and the servant ran to meet her and said let me i pray thee 
drink a little water of thy pitcher 
and she said drink my lord and she hasted and let down her 
pitcher upon her hand and gave him drink 
and when she had done giving him drink she said i will draw 
water for thy camels also until they have done drinking 
and she hasted and emptied her pitcher into the trough and ran 
again unto the well to draw water and drew for all his camels 
and the man wondering at her held his peace to wit whether the 
lord had made his journey prosperous or not 
and it came to pass as the camels had done drinking that the 
man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight and two bracelets 
for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold and said whose 
daughter art thou tell me i pray thee is there room in thy father s 
house for us to lodge in and she said unto him i am the 
daughter of bethuel the son of milcah which she bare unto nahor 
she said moreover unto him we have both straw and provender 
enough and room to lodge in 
and the man bowed down his head and worshipped the lord 
and he said blessed be the lord god of my master abraham who 
hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth i being 
in the way the lord led me to the house of my master s brethren 
and the damsel ran and told them of her mother s house these 
things 
and rebekah had a brother and his name was laban and laban ran 
out unto the man unto the well 
and it came to pass when he saw the earring and bracelets upon 
his sister s hands and when he heard the words of rebekah his sister 
saying thus spake the man unto me that he came unto the man and 
behold he stood by the camels at the well 
and he said come in thou blessed of the lord wherefore 
standest thou without for i have prepared the house and room for the 
camels 
and the man came into the house and he ungirded his camels and 
gave straw and provender for the camels and water to wash his feet 
and the men s feet that were with him 
and there was set meat before him to eat but he said i will 
not eat until i have told mine errand and he said speak on 
and he said i am abraham s servant 
and the lord hath blessed my master greatly and he is become 
great and he hath given him flocks and herds and silver and gold 
and menservants and maidservants and camels and asses 
and sarah my master s wife bare a son to my master when she was 
old and unto him hath he given all that he hath 
and my master made me swear saying thou shalt not take a wife 
to my son of the daughters of the canaanites in whose land i dwell 
but thou shalt go unto my father s house and to my kindred and 
take a wife unto my son 
and i said unto my master peradventure the woman will not 
follow me 
and he said unto me the lord before whom i walk will send his 
angel with thee and prosper thy way and thou shalt take a wife for 
my son of my kindred and of my father s house then shalt thou 
be clear from this my oath when thou comest to my kindred and if 
they give not thee one thou shalt be clear from my oath 
and i came this day unto the well and said o lord god of my 
master abraham if now thou do prosper my way which i go 
behold i stand by the well of water and it shall come to pass that 
when the virgin cometh forth to draw water and i say to her give me 
i pray thee a little water of thy pitcher to drink and she say 
to me both drink thou and i will also draw for thy camels let the 
same be the woman whom the lord hath appointed out for my master s 
son 
and before i had done speaking in mine heart behold rebekah 
came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder and she went down unto 
the well and drew water and i said unto her let me drink i pray 
thee 
and she made haste and let down her pitcher from her shoulder 
and said drink and i will give thy camels drink also so i drank 
and she made the camels drink also 
and i asked her and said whose daughter art thou and she 
said the daughter of bethuel nahor s son whom milcah bare unto him 
and i put the earring upon her face and the bracelets upon her hands 
and i bowed down my head and worshipped the lord and blessed 
the lord god of my master abraham which had led me in the right way 
to take my master s brother s daughter unto his son 
and now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master tell 
me and if not tell me that i may turn to the right hand or to the 
left 
then laban and bethuel answered and said the thing proceedeth 
from the lord we cannot speak unto thee bad or good 
behold rebekah is before thee take her and go and let her be 
thy master s son s wife as the lord hath spoken 
and it came to pass that when abraham s servant heard their 
words he worshipped the lord bowing himself to the earth 
and the servant brought forth jewels of silver and jewels of 
gold and raiment and gave them to rebekah he gave also to her 
brother and to her mother precious things 
and they did eat and drink he and the men that were with him 
and tarried all night and they rose up in the morning and he said 
send me away unto my master 
and her brother and her mother said let the damsel abide with 
us a few days at the least ten after that she shall go 
and he said unto them hinder me not seeing the lord hath 
prospered my way send me away that i may go to my master 
and they said we will call the damsel and enquire at her 
mouth 
and they called rebekah and said unto her wilt thou go with 
this man and she said i will go 
and they sent away rebekah their sister and her nurse and 
abraham s servant and his men 
and they blessed rebekah and said unto her thou art our 
sister be thou the mother of thousands of millions and let thy seed 
possess the gate of those which hate them 
and rebekah arose and her damsels and they rode upon the 
camels and followed the man and the servant took rebekah and went 
his way 
and isaac came from the way of the well lahairoi for he dwelt 
in the south country 
and isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide and 
he lifted up his eyes and saw and behold the camels were coming 
and rebekah lifted up her eyes and when she saw isaac she 
lighted off the camel 
for she had said unto the servant what man is this that walketh 
in the field to meet us and the servant had said it is my master 
therefore she took a vail and covered herself 
and the servant told isaac all things that he had done 
and isaac brought her into his mother sarah s tent and took 
rebekah and she became his wife and he loved her and isaac was 
comforted after his mother s death 
then again abraham took a wife and her name was keturah 
and she bare him zimran and jokshan and medan and midian and 
ishbak and shuah 
and jokshan begat sheba and dedan and the sons of dedan were 
asshurim and letushim and leummim 
and the sons of midian ephah and epher and hanoch and abidah 
and eldaah all these were the children of keturah 
and abraham gave all that he had unto isaac 
but unto the sons of the concubines which abraham had abraham 
gave gifts and sent them away from isaac his son while he yet lived 
eastward unto the east country 
and these are the days of the years of abraham s life which he 
lived an hundred threescore and fifteen years 
then abraham gave up the ghost and died in a good old age an 
old man and full of years and was gathered to his people 
and his sons isaac and ishmael buried him in the cave of 
machpelah in the field of ephron the son of zohar the hittite which 
is before mamre the field which abraham purchased of the sons 
of heth there was abraham buried and sarah his wife 
and it came to pass after the death of abraham that god blessed 
his son isaac and isaac dwelt by the well lahairoi 
now these are the generations of ishmael abraham s son whom 
hagar the egyptian sarah s handmaid bare unto abraham and 
these are the names of the sons of ishmael by their names according 
to their generations the firstborn of ishmael nebajoth and kedar 
and adbeel and mibsam and mishma and dumah and massa 
hadar and tema jetur naphish and kedemah these are the sons 
of ishmael and these are their names by their towns and by their 
castles twelve princes according to their nations 
and these are the years of the life of ishmael an hundred and 
thirty and seven years and he gave up the ghost and died and was 
gathered unto his people 
and they dwelt from havilah unto shur that is before egypt as 
thou goest toward assyria and he died in the presence of all his 
brethren 
and these are the generations of isaac abraham s son abraham 
begat isaac and isaac was forty years old when he took rebekah 
to wife the daughter of bethuel the syrian of padanaram the sister 
to laban the syrian 
and isaac intreated the lord for his wife because she was 
barren and the lord was intreated of him and rebekah his wife 
conceived 
and the children struggled together within her and she said if 
it be so why am i thus and she went to enquire of the lord 
and the lord said unto her two nations are in thy womb and two 
manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels and the one 
people shall be stronger than the other people and the elder shall 
serve the younger 
and when her days to be delivered were fulfilled behold there 
were twins in her womb 
and the first came out red all over like an hairy garment and 
they called his name esau 
and after that came his brother out and his hand took hold on 
esau s heel and his name was called jacob and isaac was threescore 
years old when she bare them 
and the boys grew and esau was a cunning hunter a man of the 
field and jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents 
and isaac loved esau because he did eat of his venison but 
rebekah loved jacob 
and jacob sod pottage and esau came from the field and he was 
faint and esau said to jacob feed me i pray thee with that 
same red pottage for i am faint therefore was his name called edom 
and jacob said sell me this day thy birthright 
and esau said behold i am at the point to die and what profit 
shall this birthright do to me and jacob said swear to me 
this day and he sware unto him and he sold his birthright unto 
jacob 
then jacob gave esau bread and pottage of lentiles and he did 
eat and drink and rose up and went his way thus esau despised his 
birthright 
and there was a famine in the land beside the first famine that 
was in the days of abraham and isaac went unto abimelech king of the 
philistines unto gerar 
and the lord appeared unto him and said go not down into egypt 
dwell in the land which i shall tell thee of sojourn in this 
land and i will be with thee and will bless thee for unto thee and 
unto thy seed i will give all these countries and i will perform the 
oath which i sware unto abraham thy father and i will make thy 
seed to multiply as the stars of heaven and will give unto thy seed 
all these countries and in thy seed shall all the nations of the 
earth be blessed because that abraham obeyed my voice and kept 
my charge my commandments my statutes and my laws 
and isaac dwelt in gerar and the men of the place asked him 
of his wife and he said she is my sister for he feared to say she 
is my wife lest said he the men of the place should kill me for 
rebekah because she was fair to look upon 
and it came to pass when he had been there a long time that 
abimelech king of the philistines looked out at a window and saw 
and behold isaac was sporting with rebekah his wife 
and abimelech called isaac and said behold of a surety she is 
thy wife and how saidst thou she is my sister and isaac said unto 
him because i said lest i die for her 
and abimelech said what is this thou hast done unto us one of 
the people might lightly have lien with thy wife and thou shouldest 
have brought guiltiness upon us 
and abimelech charged all his people saying he that toucheth 
this man or his wife shall surely be put to death 
then isaac sowed in that land and received in the same year an 
hundredfold and the lord blessed him 
and the man waxed great and went forward and grew until he 
became very great for he had possession of flocks and 
possession of herds and great store of servants and the philistines 
envied him 
for all the wells which his father s servants had digged in the 
days of abraham his father the philistines had stopped them and 
filled them with earth 
and abimelech said unto isaac go from us for thou art much 
mightier than we 
and isaac departed thence and pitched his tent in the valley of 
gerar and dwelt there 
and isaac digged again the wells of water which they had digged 
in the days of abraham his father for the philistines had stopped 
them after the death of abraham and he called their names after the 
names by which his father had called them 
and isaac s servants digged in the valley and found there a 
well of springing water 
and the herdmen of gerar did strive with isaac s herdmen 
saying the water is ours and he called the name of the well esek 
because they strove with him 
and they digged another well and strove for that also and he 
called the name of it sitnah 
and he removed from thence and digged another well and for 
that they strove not and he called the name of it rehoboth and he 
said for now the lord hath made room for us and we shall be fruitful 
in the land 
and he went up from thence to beersheba 
and the lord appeared unto him the same night and said i am 
the god of abraham thy father fear not for i am with thee and will 
bless thee and multiply thy seed for my servant abraham s sake 
and he builded an altar there and called upon the name of the 
lord and pitched his tent there and there isaac s servants digged a 
well 
then abimelech went to him from gerar and ahuzzath one of his 
friends and phichol the chief captain of his army 
and isaac said unto them wherefore come ye to me seeing ye 
hate me and have sent me away from you and they said we saw 
certainly that the lord was with thee and we said let there be now 
an oath betwixt us even betwixt us and thee and let us make a 
covenant with thee that thou wilt do us no hurt as we have not 
touched thee and as we have done unto thee nothing but good and have 
sent thee away in peace thou art now the blessed of the lord 
and he made them a feast and they did eat and drink 
and they rose up betimes in the morning and sware one to 
another and isaac sent them away and they departed from him in 
peace 
and it came to pass the same day that isaac s servants came 
and told him concerning the well which they had digged and said unto 
him we have found water 
and he called it shebah therefore the name of the city is 
beersheba unto this day 
and esau was forty years old when he took to wife judith the 
daughter of beeri the hittite and bashemath the daughter of elon the 
hittite which were a grief of mind unto isaac and to rebekah 
and it came to pass that when isaac was old and his eyes were 
dim so that he could not see he called esau his eldest son and said 
unto him my son and he said unto him behold here am i 
and he said behold now i am old i know not the day of my 
death now therefore take i pray thee thy weapons thy quiver 
and thy bow and go out to the field and take me some venison 
and make me savoury meat such as i love and bring it to me that i 
may eat that my soul may bless thee before i die 
and rebekah heard when isaac spake to esau his son and esau went 
to the field to hunt for venison and to bring it 
and rebekah spake unto jacob her son saying behold i heard thy 
father speak unto esau thy brother saying bring me venison and 
make me savoury meat that i may eat and bless thee before the lord 
before my death 
now therefore my son obey my voice according to that which i 
command thee 
go now to the flock and fetch me from thence two good kids of 
the goats and i will make them savoury meat for thy father such as 
he loveth and thou shalt bring it to thy father that he may 
eat and that he may bless thee before his death 
and jacob said to rebekah his mother behold esau my brother is 
a hairy man and i am a smooth man my father peradventure will 
feel me and i shall seem to him as a deceiver and i shall bring a 
curse upon me and not a blessing 
and his mother said unto him upon me be thy curse my son only 
obey my voice and go fetch me them 
and he went and fetched and brought them to his mother and 
his mother made savoury meat such as his father loved 
and rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son esau which 
were with her in the house and put them upon jacob her younger son 
and she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands 
and upon the smooth of his neck and she gave the savoury meat 
and the bread which she had prepared into the hand of her son jacob 
and he came unto his father and said my father and he said 
here am i who art thou my son and jacob said unto his 
father i am esau thy first born i have done according as thou badest 
me arise i pray thee sit and eat of my venison that thy soul may 
bless me 
and isaac said unto his son how is it that thou hast found it 
so quickly my son and he said because the lord thy god brought it 
to me 
and isaac said unto jacob come near i pray thee that i may 
feel thee my son whether thou be my very son esau or not 
and jacob went near unto isaac his father and he felt him and 
said the voice is jacob s voice but the hands are the hands of esau 
and he discerned him not because his hands were hairy as his 
brother esau s hands so he blessed him 
and he said art thou my very son esau and he said i am 
and he said bring it near to me and i will eat of my son s 
venison that my soul may bless thee and he brought it near to him 
and he did eat and he brought him wine and he drank 
and his father isaac said unto him come near now and kiss me 
my son 
and he came near and kissed him and he smelled the smell of 
his raiment and blessed him and said see the smell of my son is as 
the smell of a field which the lord hath blessed therefore god 
give thee of the dew of heaven and the fatness of the earth and 
plenty of corn and wine let people serve thee and nations bow 
down to thee be lord over thy brethren and let thy mother s sons bow 
down to thee cursed be every one that curseth thee and blessed be he 
that blesseth thee 
and it came to pass as soon as isaac had made an end of 
blessing jacob and jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of 
isaac his father that esau his brother came in from his hunting 
and he also had made savoury meat and brought it unto his 
father and said unto his father let my father arise and eat of his 
son s venison that thy soul may bless me 
and isaac his father said unto him who art thou and he said i 
am thy son thy firstborn esau 
and isaac trembled very exceedingly and said who where is he 
that hath taken venison and brought it me and i have eaten of all 
before thou camest and have blessed him yea and he shall be 
blessed 
and when esau heard the words of his father he cried with a 
great and exceeding bitter cry and said unto his father bless me 
even me also o my father 
and he said thy brother came with subtilty and hath taken away 
thy blessing 
and he said is not he rightly named jacob for he hath 
supplanted me these two times he took away my birthright and 
behold now he hath taken away my blessing and he said hast thou not 
reserved a blessing for me and isaac answered and said unto 
esau behold i have made him thy lord and all his brethren have i 
given to him for servants and with corn and wine have i sustained 
him and what shall i do now unto thee my son and esau said 
unto his father hast thou but one blessing my father bless me even 
me also o my father and esau lifted up his voice and wept 
and isaac his father answered and said unto him behold thy 
dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth and of the dew of heaven 
from above and by thy sword shalt thou live and shalt serve 
thy brother and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the 
dominion that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck 
and esau hated jacob because of the blessing wherewith his 
father blessed him and esau said in his heart the days of mourning 
for my father are at hand then will i slay my brother jacob 
and these words of esau her elder son were told to rebekah and 
she sent and called jacob her younger son and said unto him behold 
thy brother esau as touching thee doth comfort himself purposing to 
kill thee 
now therefore my son obey my voice arise flee thou to laban 
my brother to haran and tarry with him a few days until thy 
brother s fury turn away until thy brother s anger turn away 
from thee and he forget that which thou hast done to him then i will 
send and fetch thee from thence why should i be deprived also of you 
both in one day and rebekah said to isaac i am weary of my 
life because of the daughters of heth if jacob take a wife of the 
daughters of heth such as these which are of the daughters of the 
land what good shall my life do me and isaac called jacob and 
blessed him and charged him and said unto him thou shalt not take a 
wife of the daughters of canaan 
arise go to padanaram to the house of bethuel thy mother s 
father and take thee a wife from thence of the daughers of laban thy 
mother s brother 
and god almighty bless thee and make thee fruitful and multiply 
thee that thou mayest be a multitude of people and give thee 
the blessing of abraham to thee and to thy seed with thee that thou 
mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger which god gave 
unto abraham 
and isaac sent away jacob and he went to padanaram unto laban 
son of bethuel the syrian the brother of rebekah jacob s and esau s 
mother 
when esau saw that isaac had blessed jacob and sent him away to 
padanaram to take him a wife from thence and that as he blessed him 
he gave him a charge saying thou shalt not take a wife of the 
daughers of canaan and that jacob obeyed his father and his 
mother and was gone to padanaram and esau seeing that the 
daughters of canaan pleased not isaac his father then went esau 
unto ishmael and took unto the wives which he had mahalath the 
daughter of ishmael abraham s son the sister of nebajoth to be his 
wife 
and jacob went out from beersheba and went toward haran 
and he lighted upon a certain place and tarried there all 
night because the sun was set and he took of the stones of that 
place and put them for his pillows and lay down in that place to 
sleep 
and he dreamed and behold a ladder set up on the earth and the 
top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of god ascending 
and descending on it 
and behold the lord stood above it and said i am the lord 
god of abraham thy father and the god of isaac the land whereon thou 
liest to thee will i give it and to thy seed and thy seed 
shall be as the dust of the earth and thou shalt spread abroad to the 
west and to the east and to the north and to the south and in thee 
and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed 
and behold i am with thee and will keep thee in all places 
whither thou goest and will bring thee again into this land for i 
will not leave thee until i have done that which i have spoken to 
thee of 
and jacob awaked out of his sleep and he said surely the lord 
is in this place and i knew it not 
and he was afraid and said how dreadful is this place this is 
none other but the house of god and this is the gate of heaven 
and jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that 
he had put for his pillows and set it up for a pillar and poured oil 
upon the top of it 
and he called the name of that place bethel but the name of 
that city was called luz at the first 
and jacob vowed a vow saying if god will be with me and will 
keep me in this way that i go and will give me bread to eat and 
raiment to put on so that i come again to my father s house in 
peace then shall the lord be my god and this stone which i 
have set for a pillar shall be god s house and of all that thou 
shalt give me i will surely give the tenth unto thee 
then jacob went on his journey and came into the land of the 
people of the east 
and he looked and behold a well in the field and lo there 
were three flocks of sheep lying by it for out of that well they 
watered the flocks and a great stone was upon the well s mouth 
and thither were all the flocks gathered and they rolled the 
stone from the well s mouth and watered the sheep and put the stone 
again upon the well s mouth in his place 
and jacob said unto them my brethren whence be ye and they 
said of haran are we 
and he said unto them know ye laban the son of nahor and they 
said we know him 
and he said unto them is he well and they said he is well 
and behold rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep 
and he said lo it is yet high day neither is it time that the 
cattle should be gathered together water ye the sheep and go and 
feed them 
and they said we cannot until all the flocks be gathered 
together and till they roll the stone from the well s mouth then we 
water the sheep 
and while he yet spake with them rachel came with her father s 
sheep for she kept them 
and it came to pass when jacob saw rachel the daughter of laban 
his mother s brother and the sheep of laban his mother s brother 
that jacob went near and rolled the stone from the well s mouth and 
watered the flock of laban his mother s brother 
and jacob kissed rachel and lifted up his voice and wept 
and jacob told rachel that he was her father s brother and that 
he was rebekah s son and she ran and told her father 
and it came to pass when laban heard the tidings of jacob his 
sister s son that he ran to meet him and embraced him and kissed 
him and brought him to his house and he told laban all these things 
and laban said to him surely thou art my bone and my flesh and 
he abode with him the space of a month 
and laban said unto jacob because thou art my brother 
shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought tell me what shall thy 
wages be and laban had two daughters the name of the elder 
was leah and the name of the younger was rachel 
leah was tender eyed but rachel was beautiful and well 
favoured 
and jacob loved rachel and said i will serve thee seven years 
for rachel thy younger daughter 
and laban said it is better that i give her to thee than that 
i should give her to another man abide with me 
and jacob served seven years for rachel and they seemed unto 
him but a few days for the love he had to her 
and jacob said unto laban give me my wife for my days are 
fulfilled that i may go in unto her 
and laban gathered together all the men of the place and made a 
feast 
and it came to pass in the evening that he took leah his 
daughter and brought her to him and he went in unto her 
and laban gave unto his daughter leah zilpah his maid for an 
handmaid 
and it came to pass that in the morning behold it was leah 
and he said to laban what is this thou hast done unto me did not i 
serve with thee for rachel wherefore then hast thou beguiled me 
and laban said it must not be so done in our country to give 
the younger before the firstborn 
fulfil her week and we will give thee this also for the service 
which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years 
and jacob did so and fulfilled her week and he gave him rachel 
his daughter to wife also 
and laban gave to rachel his daughter bilhah his handmaid to be 
her maid 
and he went in also unto rachel and he loved also rachel more 
than leah and served with him yet seven other years 
and when the lord saw that leah was hated he opened her womb 
but rachel was barren 
and leah conceived and bare a son and she called his name 
reuben for she said surely the lord hath looked upon my affliction 
now therefore my husband will love me 
and she conceived again and bare a son and said because the 
lord hath heard i was hated he hath therefore given me this son also 
and she called his name simeon 
and she conceived again and bare a son and said now this time 
will my husband be joined unto me because i have born him three sons 
therefore was his name called levi 
and she conceived again and bare a son and she said now will 
i praise the lord therefore she called his name judah and left 
bearing 
and when rachel saw that she bare jacob no children rachel 
envied her sister and said unto jacob give me children or else i 
die 
and jacob s anger was kindled against rachel and he said am i 
in god s stead who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb 
and she said behold my maid bilhah go in unto her and she 
shall bear upon my knees that i may also have children by her 
and she gave him bilhah her handmaid to wife and jacob went in 
unto her 
and bilhah conceived and bare jacob a son 
and rachel said god hath judged me and hath also heard my 
voice and hath given me a son therefore called she his name dan 
and bilhah rachel s maid conceived again and bare jacob a second 
son 
and rachel said with great wrestlings have i wrestled with my 
sister and i have prevailed and she called his name naphtali 
when leah saw that she had left bearing she took zilpah her 
maid and gave her jacob to wife 
and zilpah leah s maid bare jacob a son 
and leah said a troop cometh and she called his name gad 
and zilpah leah s maid bare jacob a second son 
and leah said happy am i for the daughters will call me 
blessed and she called his name asher 
and reuben went in the days of wheat harvest and found 
mandrakes in the field and brought them unto his mother leah then 
rachel said to leah give me i pray thee of thy son s mandrakes 
and she said unto her is it a small matter that thou hast taken 
my husband and wouldest thou take away my son s mandrakes also and 
rachel said therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son s 
mandrakes 
and jacob came out of the field in the evening and leah went 
out to meet him and said thou must come in unto me for surely i 
have hired thee with my son s mandrakes and he lay with her that 
night 
and god hearkened unto leah and she conceived and bare jacob 
the fifth son 
and leah said god hath given me my hire because i have given 
my maiden to my husband and she called his name issachar 
and leah conceived again and bare jacob the sixth son 
and leah said god hath endued me with a good dowry now will my 
husband dwell with me because i have born him six sons and she 
called his name zebulun 
and afterwards she bare a daughter and called her name dinah 
and god remembered rachel and god hearkened to her and opened 
her womb 
and she conceived and bare a son and said god hath taken away 
my reproach and she called his name joseph and said the lord 
shall add to me another son 
and it came to pass when rachel had born joseph that jacob 
said unto laban send me away that i may go unto mine own place and 
to my country 
give me my wives and my children for whom i have served thee 
and let me go for thou knowest my service which i have done thee 
and laban said unto him i pray thee if i have found favour in 
thine eyes tarry for i have learned by experience that the lord hath 
blessed me for thy sake 
and he said appoint me thy wages and i will give it 
and he said unto him thou knowest how i have served thee and 
how thy cattle was with me 
for it was little which thou hadst before i came and it is now 
increased unto a multitude and the lord hath blessed thee since my 
coming and now when shall i provide for mine own house also 
and he said what shall i give thee and jacob said thou shalt not 
give me any thing if thou wilt do this thing for me i will again 
feed and keep thy flock 
i will pass through all thy flock to day removing from thence 
all the speckled and spotted cattle and all the brown cattle among 
the sheep and the spotted and speckled among the goats and of such 
shall be my hire 
so shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come when it 
shall come for my hire before thy face every one that is not speckled 
and spotted among the goats and brown among the sheep that shall be 
counted stolen with me 
and laban said behold i would it might be according to thy 
word 
and he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and 
spotted and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted and 
every one that had some white in it and all the brown among the 
sheep and gave them into the hand of his sons 
and he set three days journey betwixt himself and jacob and 
jacob fed the rest of laban s flocks 
and jacob took him rods of green poplar and of the hazel and 
chesnut tree and pilled white strakes in them and made the white 
appear which was in the rods 
and he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the 
gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink that 
they should conceive when they came to drink 
and the flocks conceived before the rods and brought forth 
cattle ringstraked speckled and spotted 
and jacob did separate the lambs and set the faces of the 
flocks toward the ringstraked and all the brown in the flock of 
laban and he put his own flocks by themselves and put them not unto 
laban s cattle 
and it came to pass whensoever the stronger cattle did 
conceive that jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in 
the gutters that they might conceive among the rods 
but when the cattle were feeble he put them not in so the 
feebler were laban s and the stronger jacob s 
and the man increased exceedingly and had much cattle and 
maidservants and menservants and camels and asses 
and he heard the words of laban s sons saying jacob hath taken 
away all that was our father s and of that which was our father s 
hath he gotten all this glory 
and jacob beheld the countenance of laban and behold it was 
not toward him as before 
and the lord said unto jacob return unto the land of thy 
fathers and to thy kindred and i will be with thee 
and jacob sent and called rachel and leah to the field unto his 
flock and said unto them i see your father s countenance that 
it is not toward me as before but the god of my father hath been with 
me 
and ye know that with all my power i have served your father 
and your father hath deceived me and changed my wages ten times 
but god suffered him not to hurt me 
if he said thus the speckled shall be thy wages then all the 
cattle bare speckled and if he said thus the ringstraked shall be 
thy hire then bare all the cattle ringstraked 
thus god hath taken away the cattle of your father and given 
them to me 
and it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived that 
i lifted up mine eyes and saw in a dream and behold the rams which 
leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked speckled and grisled 
and the angel of god spake unto me in a dream saying jacob 
and i said here am i 
and he said lift up now thine eyes and see all the rams which 
leap upon the cattle are ringstraked speckled and grisled for i 
have seen all that laban doeth unto thee 
i am the god of bethel where thou anointedst the pillar and 
where thou vowedst a vow unto me now arise get thee out from this 
land and return unto the land of thy kindred 
and rachel and leah answered and said unto him is there yet any 
portion or inheritance for us in our father s house are we not 
counted of him strangers for he hath sold us and hath quite devoured 
also our money 
for all the riches which god hath taken from our father that is 
ours and our children s now then whatsoever god hath said unto 
thee do 
then jacob rose up and set his sons and his wives upon camels 
and he carried away all his cattle and all his goods which he 
had gotten the cattle of his getting which he had gotten in 
padanaram for to go to isaac his father in the land of canaan 
and laban went to shear his sheep and rachel had stolen the 
images that were her father s 
and jacob stole away unawares to laban the syrian in that he 
told him not that he fled 
so he fled with all that he had and he rose up and passed over 
the river and set his face toward the mount gilead 
and it was told laban on the third day that jacob was fled 
and he took his brethren with him and pursued after him seven 
days journey and they overtook him in the mount gilead 
and god came to laban the syrian in a dream by night and said 
unto him take heed that thou speak not to jacob either good or bad 
then laban overtook jacob now jacob had pitched his tent in the 
mount and laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of gilead 
and laban said to jacob what hast thou done that thou hast 
stolen away unawares to me and carried away my daughters as captives 
taken with the sword wherefore didst thou flee away secretly 
and steal away from me and didst not tell me that i might have sent 
thee away with mirth and with songs with tabret and with harp 
and hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters thou 
hast now done foolishly in so doing 
it is in the power of my hand to do you hurt but the god of 
your father spake unto me yesternight saying take thou heed that 
thou speak not to jacob either good or bad 
and now though thou wouldest needs be gone because thou sore 
longedst after thy father s house yet wherefore hast thou stolen my 
gods and jacob answered and said to laban because i was 
afraid for i said peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy 
daughters from me 
with whomsoever thou findest thy gods let him not live before 
our brethren discern thou what is thine with me and take it to thee 
for jacob knew not that rachel had stolen them 
and laban went into jacob s tent and into leah s tent and into 
the two maidservants tents but he found them not then went he out 
of leah s tent and entered into rachel s tent 
now rachel had taken the images and put them in the camel s 
furniture and sat upon them and laban searched all the tent but 
found them not 
and she said to her father let it not displease my lord that i 
cannot rise up before thee for the custom of women is upon me and he 
searched but found not the images 
and jacob was wroth and chode with laban and jacob answered 
and said to laban what is my trespass what is my sin that thou hast 
so hotly pursued after me whereas thou hast searched all my 
stuff what hast thou found of all thy household stuff set it here 
before my brethren and thy brethren that they may judge betwixt us 
both 
this twenty years have i been with thee thy ewes and thy she 
goats have not cast their young and the rams of thy flock have i not 
eaten 
that which was torn of beasts i brought not unto thee i bare 
the loss of it of my hand didst thou require it whether stolen by 
day or stolen by night 
thus i was in the day the drought consumed me and the frost by 
night and my sleep departed from mine eyes 
thus have i been twenty years in thy house i served thee 
fourteen years for thy two daughters and six years for thy cattle 
and thou hast changed my wages ten times 
except the god of my father the god of abraham and the fear of 
isaac had been with me surely thou hadst sent me away now empty god 
hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands and rebuked thee 
yesternight 
and laban answered and said unto jacob these daughters are my 
daughters and these children are my children and these cattle are my 
cattle and all that thou seest is mine and what can i do this day 
unto these my daughters or unto their children which they have born 
now therefore come thou let us make a covenant i and thou and 
let it be for a witness between me and thee 
and jacob took a stone and set it up for a pillar 
and jacob said unto his brethren gather stones and they took 
stones and made an heap and they did eat there upon the heap 
and laban called it jegarsahadutha but jacob called it galeed 
and laban said this heap is a witness between me and thee this 
day 
therefore was the name of it called galeed and mizpah for he 
said the lord watch between me and thee when we are absent one from 
another 
if thou shalt afflict my daughters or if thou shalt take other 
wives beside my daughters no man is with us see god is witness 
betwixt me and thee 
and laban said to jacob behold this heap and behold this 
pillar which i have cast betwixt me and thee this heap be 
witness and this pillar be witness that i will not pass over this 
heap to thee and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this 
pillar unto me for harm 
the god of abraham and the god of nahor the god of their 
father judge betwixt us and jacob sware by the fear of his father 
isaac 
then jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount and called his 
brethren to eat bread and they did eat bread and tarried all night 
in the mount 
and early in the morning laban rose up and kissed his sons and 
his daughters and blessed them and laban departed and returned unto 
his place 
and jacob went on his way and the angels of god met him 
and when jacob saw them he said this is god s host and he 
called the name of that place mahanaim 
and jacob sent messengers before him to esau his brother unto the 
land of seir the country of edom 
and he commanded them saying thus shall ye speak unto my lord 
esau thy servant jacob saith thus i have sojourned with laban and 
stayed there until now and i have oxen and asses flocks and 
menservants and womenservants and i have sent to tell my lord that 
i may find grace in thy sight 
and the messengers returned to jacob saying we came to thy 
brother esau and also he cometh to meet thee and four hundred men 
with him 
then jacob was greatly afraid and distressed and he divided the 
people that was with him and the flocks and herds and the camels 
into two bands and said if esau come to the one company and 
smite it then the other company which is left shall escape 
and jacob said o god of my father abraham and god of my father 
isaac the lord which saidst unto me return unto thy country and to 
thy kindred and i will deal well with thee i am not worthy of 
the least of all the mercies and of all the truth which thou hast 
shewed unto thy servant for with my staff i passed over this jordan 
and now i am become two bands 
deliver me i pray thee from the hand of my brother from the 
hand of esau for i fear him lest he will come and smite me and the 
mother with the children 
and thou saidst i will surely do thee good and make thy seed 
as the sand of the sea which cannot be numbered for multitude 
and he lodged there that same night and took of that which came 
to his hand a present for esau his brother two hundred she 
goats and twenty he goats two hundred ewes and twenty rams 
thirty milch camels with their colts forty kine and ten bulls 
twenty she asses and ten foals 
and he delivered them into the hand of his servants every drove 
by themselves and said unto his servants pass over before me and 
put a space betwixt drove and drove 
and he commanded the foremost saying when esau my brother 
meeteth thee and asketh thee saying whose art thou and whither 
goest thou and whose are these before thee then thou shalt 
say they be thy servant jacob s it is a present sent unto my lord 
esau and behold also he is behind us 
and so commanded he the second and the third and all that 
followed the droves saying on this manner shall ye speak unto esau 
when ye find him 
and say ye moreover behold thy servant jacob is behind us for 
he said i will appease him with the present that goeth before me and 
afterward i will see his face peradventure he will accept of me 
so went the present over before him and himself lodged that 
night in the company 
and he rose up that night and took his two wives and his two 
womenservants and his eleven sons and passed over the ford jabbok 
and he took them and sent them over the brook and sent over 
that he had 
and jacob was left alone and there wrestled a man with him 
until the breaking of the day 
and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched 
the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of jacob s thigh was out of 
joint as he wrestled with him 
and he said let me go for the day breaketh and he said i 
will not let thee go except thou bless me 
and he said unto him what is thy name and he said jacob 
and he said thy name shall be called no more jacob but israel 
for as a prince hast thou power with god and with men and hast 
prevailed 
and jacob asked him and said tell me i pray thee thy name 
and he said wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name and he 
blessed him there 
and jacob called the name of the place peniel for i have seen 
god face to face and my life is preserved 
and as he passed over penuel the sun rose upon him and he 
halted upon his thigh 
therefore the children of israel eat not of the sinew which 
shrank which is upon the hollow of the thigh unto this day because 
he touched the hollow of jacob s thigh in the sinew that shrank 
and jacob lifted up his eyes and looked and behold esau came 
and with him four hundred men and he divided the children unto leah 
and unto rachel and unto the two handmaids 
and he put the handmaids and their children foremost and leah 
and her children after and rachel and joseph hindermost 
and he passed over before them and bowed himself to the ground 
seven times until he came near to his brother 
and esau ran to meet him and embraced him and fell on his neck 
and kissed him and they wept 
and he lifted up his eyes and saw the women and the children 
and said who are those with thee and he said the children which god 
hath graciously given thy servant 
then the handmaidens came near they and their children and they 
bowed themselves 
and leah also with her children came near and bowed themselves 
and after came joseph near and rachel and they bowed themselves 
and he said what meanest thou by all this drove which i met and 
he said these are to find grace in the sight of my lord 
and esau said i have enough my brother keep that thou hast 
unto thyself 
and jacob said nay i pray thee if now i have found grace in 
thy sight then receive my present at my hand for therefore i have 
seen thy face as though i had seen the face of god and thou wast 
pleased with me 
take i pray thee my blessing that is brought to thee because 
god hath dealt graciously with me and because i have enough and he 
urged him and he took it 
and he said let us take our journey and let us go and i will 
go before thee 
and he said unto him my lord knoweth that the children are 
tender and the flocks and herds with young are with me and if men 
should overdrive them one day all the flock will die 
let my lord i pray thee pass over before his servant and i 
will lead on softly according as the cattle that goeth before me and 
the children be able to endure until i come unto my lord unto seir 
and esau said let me now leave with thee some of the folk that 
are with me and he said what needeth it let me find grace in the 
sight of my lord 
so esau returned that day on his way unto seir 
and jacob journeyed to succoth and built him an house and made 
booths for his cattle therefore the name of the place is called 
succoth 
and jacob came to shalem a city of shechem which is in the 
land of canaan when he came from padanaram and pitched his tent 
before the city 
and he bought a parcel of a field where he had spread his tent 
at the hand of the children of hamor shechem s father for an hundred 
pieces of money 
and he erected there an altar and called it eleloheisrael 
and dinah the daughter of leah which she bare unto jacob went 
out to see the daughters of the land 
and when shechem the son of hamor the hivite prince of the 
country saw her he took her and lay with her and defiled her 
and his soul clave unto dinah the daughter of jacob and he loved 
the damsel and spake kindly unto the damsel 
and shechem spake unto his father hamor saying get me this 
damsel to wife 
and jacob heard that he had defiled dinah his daughter now his 
sons were with his cattle in the field and jacob held his peace until 
they were come 
and hamor the father of shechem went out unto jacob to commune 
with him 
and the sons of jacob came out of the field when they heard it 
and the men were grieved and they were very wroth because he had 
wrought folly in israel in lying with jacob s daughter which thing 
ought not to be done 
and hamor communed with them saying the soul of my son shechem 
longeth for your daughter i pray you give her him to wife 
and make ye marriages with us and give your daughters unto us 
and take our daughters unto you 
and ye shall dwell with us and the land shall be before you 
dwell and trade ye therein and get you possessions therein 
and shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren let me 
find grace in your eyes and what ye shall say unto me i will give 
ask me never so much dowry and gift and i will give according 
as ye shall say unto me but give me the damsel to wife 
and the sons of jacob answered shechem and hamor his father 
deceitfully and said because he had defiled dinah their sister 
and they said unto them we cannot do this thing to give our 
sister to one that is uncircumcised for that were a reproach unto us 
but in this will we consent unto you if ye will be as we be 
that every male of you be circumcised then will we give our 
daughters unto you and we will take your daughters to us and we will 
dwell with you and we will become one people 
but if ye will not hearken unto us to be circumcised then will 
we take our daughter and we will be gone 
and their words pleased hamor and shechem hamor s son 
and the young man deferred not to do the thing because he had 
delight in jacob s daughter and he was more honourable than all the 
house of his father 
and hamor and shechem his son came unto the gate of their city 
and communed with the men of their city saying these men are 
peaceable with us therefore let them dwell in the land and trade 
therein for the land behold it is large enough for them let us 
take their daughters to us for wives and let us give them our 
daughters 
only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us 
to be one people if every male among us be circumcised as they are 
circumcised 
shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of 
their s be our s only let us consent unto them and they will dwell 
with us 
and unto hamor and unto shechem his son hearkened all that went 
out of the gate of his city and every male was circumcised all that 
went out of the gate of his city 
and it came to pass on the third day when they were sore that 
two of the sons of jacob simeon and levi dinah s brethren took each 
man his sword and came upon the city boldly and slew all the males 
and they slew hamor and shechem his son with the edge of the 
sword and took dinah out of shechem s house and went out 
the sons of jacob came upon the slain and spoiled the city 
because they had defiled their sister 
they took their sheep and their oxen and their asses and that 
which was in the city and that which was in the field and all 
their wealth and all their little ones and their wives took they 
captive and spoiled even all that was in the house 
and jacob said to simeon and levi ye have troubled me to make 
me to stink among the inhabitants of the land among the canaanites 
and the perizzites and i being few in number they shall gather 
themselves together against me and slay me and i shall be destroyed 
i and my house 
and they said should he deal with our sister as with an harlot 
and god said unto jacob arise go up to bethel and dwell there 
and make there an altar unto god that appeared unto thee when thou 
fleddest from the face of esau thy brother 
then jacob said unto his household and to all that were with 
him put away the strange gods that are among you and be clean and 
change your garments and let us arise and go up to bethel and 
i will make there an altar unto god who answered me in the day of my 
distress and was with me in the way which i went 
and they gave unto jacob all the strange gods which were in their 
hand and all their earrings which were in their ears and jacob hid 
them under the oak which was by shechem 
and they journeyed and the terror of god was upon the cities 
that were round about them and they did not pursue after the sons of 
jacob 
so jacob came to luz which is in the land of canaan that is 
bethel he and all the people that were with him 
and he built there an altar and called the place elbethel 
because there god appeared unto him when he fled from the face of his 
brother 
but deborah rebekah s nurse died and she was buried beneath 
bethel under an oak and the name of it was called allonbachuth 
and god appeared unto jacob again when he came out of padanaram 
and blessed him 
and god said unto him thy name is jacob thy name shall not be 
called any more jacob but israel shall be thy name and he called his 
name israel 
and god said unto him i am god almighty be fruitful and 
multiply a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee and 
kings shall come out of thy loins and the land which i gave 
abraham and isaac to thee i will give it and to thy seed after thee 
will i give the land 
and god went up from him in the place where he talked with him 
and jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him 
even a pillar of stone and he poured a drink offering thereon and he 
poured oil thereon 
and jacob called the name of the place where god spake with him 
bethel 
and they journeyed from bethel and there was but a little way 
to come to ephrath and rachel travailed and she had hard labour 
and it came to pass when she was in hard labour that the 
midwife said unto her fear not thou shalt have this son also 
and it came to pass as her soul was in departing for she 
died that she called his name benoni but his father called him 
benjamin 
and rachel died and was buried in the way to ephrath which is 
bethlehem 
and jacob set a pillar upon her grave that is the pillar of 
rachel s grave unto this day 
and israel journeyed and spread his tent beyond the tower of 
edar 
and it came to pass when israel dwelt in that land that reuben 
went and lay with bilhah his father s concubine and israel heard it 
now the sons of jacob were twelve the sons of leah reuben 
jacob s firstborn and simeon and levi and judah and issachar and 
zebulun the sons of rachel joseph and benjamin and the 
sons of bilhah rachel s handmaid dan and naphtali and the 
sons of zilpah leah s handmaid gad and asher these are the sons of 
jacob which were born to him in padanaram 
and jacob came unto isaac his father unto mamre unto the city 
of arbah which is hebron where abraham and isaac sojourned 
and the days of isaac were an hundred and fourscore years 
and isaac gave up the ghost and died and was gathered unto his 
people being old and full of days and his sons esau and jacob buried 
him

of elon the hittite and aholibamah the daughter of anah the daughter

the persons of his house and his cattle and all his beasts and all 
his substance which he had got in the land of canaan and went into 
the country from the face of his brother jacob

and jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger in 
the land of canaan 
these are the generations of jacob joseph being seventeen years 
old was feeding the flock with his brethren and the lad was with the 
sons of bilhah and with the sons of zilpah his father s wives and 
joseph brought unto his father their evil report 
now israel loved joseph more than all his children because he 
was the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colours 
and when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than 
all his brethren they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto 
him 
and joseph dreamed a dream and he told it his brethren and they 
hated him yet the more 
and he said unto them hear i pray you this dream which i have 
dreamed for behold we were binding sheaves in the field and 
lo my sheaf arose and also stood upright and behold your sheaves 
stood round about and made obeisance to my sheaf 
and his brethren said to him shalt thou indeed reign over us or 
shalt thou indeed have dominion over us and they hated him yet the 
more for his dreams and for his words 
and he dreamed yet another dream and told it his brethren and 
said behold i have dreamed a dream more and behold the sun and 
the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me 
and he told it to his father and to his brethren and his 
father rebuked him and said unto him what is this dream that thou 
hast dreamed shall i and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to 
bow down ourselves to thee to the earth and his brethren 
envied him but his father observed the saying 
and his brethren went to feed their father s flock in shechem 
and israel said unto joseph do not thy brethren feed the flock 
in shechem come and i will send thee unto them and he said to him 
here am i 
and he said to him go i pray thee see whether it be well with 
thy brethren and well with the flocks and bring me word again so he 
sent him out of the vale of hebron and he came to shechem 
and a certain man found him and behold he was wandering in 
the field and the man asked him saying what seekest thou 
and he said i seek my brethren tell me i pray thee where they feed 
their flocks 
and the man said they are departed hence for i heard them say 
let us go to dothan and joseph went after his brethren and found 
them in dothan 
and when they saw him afar off even before he came near unto 
them they conspired against him to slay him 
and they said one to another behold this dreamer cometh 
come now therefore and let us slay him and cast him into some 
pit and we will say some evil beast hath devoured him and we shall 
see what will become of his dreams 
and reuben heard it and he delivered him out of their hands 
and said let us not kill him 
and reuben said unto them she would no blood but cast him into this 
pit that is in the wilderness and lay no hand upon him that he might 
rid him out of their hands to deliver him to his father again 
and it came to pass when joseph was come unto his brethren 
that they stript joseph out of his coat his coat of many colours that 
was on him and they took him and cast him into a pit and the 
pit was empty there was no water in it 
and they sat down to eat bread and they lifted up their eyes 
and looked and behold a company of ishmeelites came from gilead 
with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh going to carry 
it down to egypt 
and judah said unto his brethren what profit is it if we slay 
our brother and conceal his blood come and let us sell him 
to the ishmeelites and let not our hand be upon him for he is our 
brother and our flesh and his brethren were content 
then there passed by midianites merchantmen and they drew and 
lifted up joseph out of the pit and sold joseph to the ishmeelites 
for twenty pieces of silver and they brought joseph into egypt 
and reuben returned unto the pit and behold joseph was not in 
the pit and he rent his clothes 
and he returned unto his brethren and said the child is not 
and i whither shall i go and they took joseph s coat and 
killed a kid of the goats and dipped the coat in the blood and 
they sent the coat of many colours and they brought it to their 
father and said this have we found know now whether it be thy son s 
coat or no 
and he knew it and said it is my son s coat an evil beast 
hath devoured him joseph is without doubt rent in pieces 
and jacob rent his clothes and put sackcloth upon his loins 
and mourned for his son many days 
and all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him 
but he refused to be comforted and he said for i will go down into 
the grave unto my son mourning thus his father wept for him 
and the midianites sold him into egypt unto potiphar an officer 
of pharaoh s and captain of the guard 
and it came to pass at that time that judah went down from his 
brethren and turned in to a certain adullamite whose name was hirah 
and judah saw there a daughter of a certain canaanite whose name 
was shuah and he took her and went in unto her 
and she conceived and bare a son and he called his name er 
and she conceived again and bare a son and she called his name 
onan 
and she yet again conceived and bare a son and called his name 
shelah and he was at chezib when she bare him 
and judah took a wife for er his firstborn whose name was tamar 
and er judah s firstborn was wicked in the sight of the lord 
and the lord slew him 
and judah said unto onan go in unto thy brother s wife and 
marry her and raise up seed to thy brother 
and onan knew that the seed should not be his and it came to 
pass when he went in unto his brother s wife that he spilled it on 
the ground lest that he should give seed to his brother 
and the thing which he did displeased the lord wherefore he 
slew him also 
then said judah to tamar his daughter in law remain a widow at 
thy father s house till shelah my son be grown for he said lest 
peradventure he die also as his brethren did and tamar went and 
dwelt in her father s house 
and in process of time the daughter of shuah judah s wife died 
and judah was comforted and went up unto his sheepshearers to 
timnath he and his friend hirah the adullamite 
and it was told tamar saying behold thy father in law goeth up 
to timnath to shear his sheep 
and she put her widow s garments off from her and covered her 
with a vail and wrapped herself and sat in an open place which is 
by the way to timnath for she saw that shelah was grown and she was 
not given unto him to wife 
when judah saw her he thought her to be an harlot because she 
had covered her face 
and he turned unto her by the way and said go to i pray thee 
let me come in unto thee for he knew not that she was his daughter 
in law and she said what wilt thou give me that thou mayest come 
in unto me and he said i will send thee a kid from the flock 
and she said wilt thou give me a pledge till thou send it 
and he said what pledge shall i give thee and she said thy signet 
and thy bracelets and thy staff that is in thine hand and he gave it 
her and came in unto her and she conceived by him 
and she arose and went away and laid by her vail from her and 
put on the garments of her widowhood 
and judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the adullamite 
to receive his pledge from the woman s hand but he found her not 
then he asked the men of that place saying where is the 
harlot that was openly by the way side and they said there was no 
harlot in this place 
and he returned to judah and said i cannot find her and also 
the men of the place said that there was no harlot in this place 
and judah said let her take it to her lest we be shamed 
behold i sent this kid and thou hast not found her 
and it came to pass about three months after that it was told 
judah saying tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot and 
also behold she is with child by whoredom and judah said bring her 
forth and let her be burnt 
when she was brought forth she sent to her father in law 
saying by the man whose these are am i with child and she said 
discern i pray thee whose are these the signet and bracelets and 
staff 
and judah acknowledged them and said she hath been more 
righteous than i because that i gave her not to shelah my son and he 
knew her again no more 
and it came to pass in the time of her travail that behold 
twins were in her womb 
and it came to pass when she travailed that the one put out 
his hand and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet 
thread saying this came out first 
and it came to pass as he drew back his hand that behold his 
brother came out and she said how hast thou broken forth this 
breach be upon thee therefore his name was called pharez 
and afterward came out his brother that had the scarlet thread 
upon his hand and his name was called zarah 
and joseph was brought down to egypt and potiphar an officer of 
pharaoh captain of the guard an egyptian bought him of the hands of 
the ishmeelites which had brought him down thither 
and the lord was with joseph and he was a prosperous man and he 
was in the house of his master the egyptian 
and his master saw that the lord was with him and that the lord 
made all that he did to prosper in his hand 
and joseph found grace in his sight and he served him and he 
made him overseer over his house and all that he had he put into his 
hand 
and it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer 
in his house and over all that he had that the lord blessed the 
egyptian s house for joseph s sake and the blessing of the lord was 
upon all that he had in the house and in the field 
and he left all that he had in joseph s hand and he knew not 
ought he had save the bread which he did eat and joseph was a goodly 
person and well favoured 
and it came to pass after these things that his master s wife 
cast her eyes upon joseph and she said lie with me 
but he refused and said unto his master s wife behold my 
master wotteth not what is with me in the house and he hath committed 
all that he hath to my hand there is none greater in this house 
than i neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee because 
thou art his wife how then can i do this great wickedness and sin 
against god and it came to pass as she spake to joseph day by 
day that he hearkened not unto her to lie by her or to be with her 
and it came to pass about this time that joseph went into the 
house to do his business and there was none of the men of the house 
there within 
and she caught him by his garment saying lie with me and he 
left his garment in her hand and fled and got him out 
and it came to pass when she saw that he had left his garment 
in her hand and was fled forth that she called unto the men of 
her house and spake unto them saying see he hath brought in an 
hebrew unto us to mock us he came in unto me to lie with me and i 
cried with a loud voice and it came to pass when he heard that 
i lifted up my voice and cried that he left his garment with me and 
fled and got him out 
and she laid up his garment by her until his lord came home 
and she spake unto him according to these words saying the 
hebrew servant which thou hast brought unto us came in unto me to 
mock me and it came to pass as i lifted up my voice and cried 
that he left his garment with me and fled out 
and it came to pass when his master heard the words of his 
wife which she spake unto him saying after this manner did thy 
servant to me that his wrath was kindled 
and joseph s master took him and put him into the prison a 
place where the king s prisoners were bound and he was there in the 
prison 
but the lord was with joseph and shewed him mercy and gave him 
favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison 
and the keeper of the prison committed to joseph s hand all the 
prisoners that were in the prison and whatsoever they did there he 
was the doer of it 
the keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under 
his hand because the lord was with him and that which he did the 
lord made it to prosper 
and it came to pass after these things that the butler of the 
king of egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of egypt 
and pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers against the 
chief of the butlers and against the chief of the bakers 
and he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard 
into the prison the place where joseph was bound 
and the captain of the guard charged joseph with them and he 
served them and they continued a season in ward 
and they dreamed a dream both of them each man his dream in one 
night each man according to the interpretation of his dream the 
butler and the baker of the king of egypt which were bound in the 
prison 
and joseph came in unto them in the morning and looked upon 
them and behold they were sad 
and he asked pharaoh s officers that were with him in the ward of 
his lord s house saying wherefore look ye so sadly to day and 
they said unto him we have dreamed a dream and there is no 
interpreter of it and joseph said unto them do not interpretations 
belong to god tell me them i pray you 
and the chief butler told his dream to joseph and said to him 
in my dream behold a vine was before me and in the vine were 
three branches and it was as though it budded and her blossoms shot 
forth and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes and 
pharaoh s cup was in my hand and i took the grapes and pressed them 
into pharaoh s cup and i gave the cup into pharaoh s hand 
and joseph said unto him this is the interpretation of it the 
three branches are three days yet within three days shall 
pharaoh lift up thine head and restore thee unto thy place and thou 
shalt deliver pharaoh s cup into his hand after the former manner 
when thou wast his butler 
but think on me when it shall be well with thee and shew 
kindness i pray thee unto me and make mention of me unto pharaoh 
and bring me out of this house for indeed i was stolen away out 
of the land of the hebrews and here also have i done nothing that 
they should put me into the dungeon 
when the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good he 
said unto joseph i also was in my dream and behold i had three 
white baskets on my head and in the uppermost basket there was 
of all manner of bakemeats for pharaoh and the birds did eat them out 
of the basket upon my head 
and joseph answered and said this is the interpretation 
thereof the three baskets are three days yet within three days 
shall pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee and shall hang thee on a 
tree and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee 
and it came to pass the third day which was pharaoh s birthday 
that he made a feast unto all his servants and he lifted up the head 
of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants 
and he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again and 
he gave the cup into pharaoh s hand but he hanged the chief 
baker as joseph had interpreted to them 
yet did not the chief butler remember joseph but forgat him 
and it came to pass at the end of two full years that pharaoh 
dreamed and behold he stood by the river 
and behold there came up out of the river seven well favoured 
kine and fatfleshed and they fed in a meadow 
and behold seven other kine came up after them out of the 
river ill favoured and leanfleshed and stood by the other kine upon 
the brink of the river 
and the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven 
well favoured and fat kine so pharaoh awoke 
and he slept and dreamed the second time and behold seven ears 
of corn came up upon one stalk rank and good 
and behold seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind 
sprung up after them 
and the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears 
and pharaoh awoke and behold it was a dream 
and it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled 
and he sent and called for all the magicians of egypt and all the 
wise men thereof and pharaoh told them his dream but there was none 
that could interpret them unto pharaoh 
then spake the chief butler unto pharaoh saying i do remember 
my faults this day pharaoh was wroth with his servants and put 
me in ward in the captain of the guard s house both me and the chief 
baker and we dreamed a dream in one night i and he we dreamed 
each man according to the interpretation of his dream 
and there was there with us a young man an hebrew servant to 
the captain of the guard and we told him and he interpreted to us 
our dreams to each man according to his dream he did interpret 
and it came to pass as he interpreted to us so it was me he 
restored unto mine office and him he hanged 
then pharaoh sent and called joseph and they brought him 
hastily out of the dungeon and he shaved himself and changed his 
raiment and came in unto pharaoh 
and pharaoh said unto joseph i have dreamed a dream and there 
is none that can interpret it and i have heard say of thee that thou 
canst understand a dream to interpret it 
and joseph answered pharaoh saying it is not in me god shall 
give pharaoh an answer of peace 
and pharaoh said unto joseph in my dream behold i stood upon 
the bank of the river and behold there came up out of the 
river seven kine fatfleshed and well favoured and they fed in a 
meadow and behold seven other kine came up after them poor 
and very ill favoured and leanfleshed such as i never saw in all the 
land of egypt for badness and the lean and the ill favoured 
kine did eat up the first seven fat kine and when they had 
eaten them up it could not be known that they had eaten them but 
they were still ill favoured as at the beginning so i awoke 
and i saw in my dream and behold seven ears came up in one 
stalk full and good and behold seven ears withered thin 
and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them and the 
thin ears devoured the seven good ears and i told this unto the 
magicians but there was none that could declare it to me 
and joseph said unto pharaoh the dream of pharaoh is one god 
hath shewed pharaoh what he is about to do 
the seven good kine are seven years and the seven good ears are 
seven years the dream is one 
and the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them 
are seven years and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind 
shall be seven years of famine 
this is the thing which i have spoken unto pharaoh what god is 
about to do he sheweth unto pharaoh 
behold there come seven years of great plenty throughout all 
the land of egypt and there shall arise after them seven years 
of famine and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of egypt 
and the famine shall consume the land and the plenty shall not 
be known in the land by reason of that famine following for it shall 
be very grievous 
and for that the dream was doubled unto pharaoh twice it is 
because the thing is established by god and god will shortly bring it 
to pass 
now therefore let pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise and 
set him over the land of egypt 
let pharaoh do this and let him appoint officers over the land 
and take up the fifth part of the land of egypt in the seven plenteous 
years 
and let them gather all the food of those good years that come 
and lay up corn under the hand of pharaoh and let them keep food in 
the cities 
and that food shall be for store to the land against the seven 
years of famine which shall be in the land of egypt that the land 
perish not through the famine 
and the thing was good in the eyes of pharaoh and in the eyes 
of all his servants 
and pharaoh said unto his servants can we find such a one as 
this is a man in whom the spirit of god is and pharaoh said 
unto joseph forasmuch as god hath shewed thee all this there is none 
so discreet and wise as thou art thou shalt be over my house 
and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled only in the 
throne will i be greater than thou 
and pharaoh said unto joseph see i have set thee over all the 
land of egypt 
and pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it upon 
joseph s hand and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen and put a 
gold chain about his neck and he made him to ride in the second 
chariot which he had and they cried before him bow the knee and he 
made him ruler over all the land of egypt 
and pharaoh said unto joseph i am pharaoh and without thee 
shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of egypt 
and pharaoh called joseph s name zaphnathpaaneah and he gave 
him to wife asenath the daughter of potipherah priest of on and 
joseph went out over all the land of egypt 
and joseph was thirty years old when he stood before pharaoh 
king of egypt and joseph went out from the presence of pharaoh and 
went throughout all the land of egypt 
and in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by 
handfuls 
and he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were 
in the land of egypt and laid up the food in the cities the food of 
the field which was round about every city laid he up in the same 
and joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea very much 
until he left numbering for it was without number 
and unto joseph were born two sons before the years of famine 
came which asenath the daughter of potipherah priest of on bare unto 
him 
and joseph called the name of the firstborn manasseh for god 
said he hath made me forget all my toil and all my father s house 
and the name of the second called he ephraim for god hath 
caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction 
and the seven years of plenteousness that was in the land of 
egypt were ended 
and the seven years of dearth began to come according as joseph 
had said and the dearth was in all lands but in all the land of 
egypt there was bread 
and when all the land of egypt was famished the people cried to 
pharaoh for bread and pharaoh said unto all the egyptians go unto 
joseph what he saith to you do 
and the famine was over all the face of the earth and joseph 
opened all the storehouses and sold unto the egyptians and the 
famine waxed sore in the land of egypt 
and all countries came into egypt to joseph for to buy corn 
because that the famine was so sore in all lands 
now when jacob saw that there was corn in egypt jacob said unto 
his sons why do ye look one upon another and he said behold 
i have heard that there is corn in egypt get you down thither and 
buy for us from thence that we may live and not die 
and joseph s ten brethren went down to buy corn in egypt 
but benjamin joseph s brother jacob sent not with his brethren 
for he said lest peradventure mischief befall him 
and the sons of israel came to buy corn among those that came 
for the famine was in the land of canaan 
and joseph was the governor over the land and he it was that 
sold to all the people of the land and joseph s brethren came and 
bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth 
and joseph saw his brethren and he knew them but made himself 
strange unto them and spake roughly unto them and he said unto them 
whence come ye and they said from the land of canaan to buy food 
and joseph knew his brethren but they knew not him 
and joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them and 
said unto them ye are spies to see the nakedness of the land ye are 
come 
and they said unto him nay my lord but to buy food are thy 
servants come 
we are all one man s sons we are true men thy servants are no 
spies 
and he said unto them nay but to see the nakedness of the land 
ye are come 
and they said thy servants are twelve brethren the sons of one 
man in the land of canaan and behold the youngest is this day with 
our father and one is not 
and joseph said unto them that is it that i spake unto you 
saying ye are spies hereby ye shall be proved by the life of 
pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence except your youngest brother come 
hither 
send one of you and let him fetch your brother and ye shall be 
kept in prison that your words may be proved whether there be any 
truth in you or else by the life of pharaoh surely ye are spies 
and he put them all together into ward three days 
and joseph said unto them the third day this do and live for 
i fear god if ye be true men let one of your brethren be bound 
in the house of your prison go ye carry corn for the famine of your 
houses but bring your youngest brother unto me so shall your 
words be verified and ye shall not die and they did so 
and they said one to another we are verily guilty concerning 
our brother in that we saw the anguish of his soul when he besought 
us and we would not hear therefore is this distress come upon us 
and reuben answered them saying spake i not unto you saying 
do not sin against the child and ye would not hear therefore 
behold also his blood is required 
and they knew not that joseph understood them for he spake unto 
them by an interpreter 
and he turned himself about from them and wept and returned to 
them again and communed with them and took from them simeon and 
bound him before their eyes 
then joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn and to 
restore every man s money into his sack and to give them provision 
for the way and thus did he unto them 
and they laded their asses with the corn and departed thence 
and as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in 
the inn he espied his money for behold it was in his sack s mouth 
and he said unto his brethren my money is restored and lo it 
is even in my sack and their heart failed them and they were afraid 
saying one to another what is this that god hath done unto us 
and they came unto jacob their father unto the land of canaan and 
told him all that befell unto them saying the man who is the 
lord of the land spake roughly to us and took us for spies of the 
country 
and we said unto him we are true men we are no spies we 
be twelve brethren sons of our father one is not and the youngest 
is this day with our father in the land of canaan 
and the man the lord of the country said unto us hereby shall 
i know that ye are true men leave one of your brethren here with me 
and take food for the famine of your households and be gone 
and bring your youngest brother unto me then shall i know that ye are 
no spies but that ye are true men so will i deliver you your 
brother and ye shall traffick in the land 
and it came to pass as they emptied their sacks that behold 
every man s bundle of money was in his sack and when both they and 
their father saw the bundles of money they were afraid 
and jacob their father said unto them me have ye bereaved of my 
children joseph is not and simeon is not and ye will take benjamin 
away all these things are against me 
and reuben spake unto his father saying slay my two sons if i 
bring him not to thee deliver him into my hand and i will bring him 
to thee again 
and he said my son shall not go down with you for his brother 
is dead and he is left alone if mischief befall him by the way in 
the which ye go then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to 
the grave 
and the famine was sore in the land 
and it came to pass when they had eaten up the corn which they 
had brought out of egypt their father said unto them go again buy 
us a little food 
and judah spake unto him saying the man did solemnly protest 
unto us saying ye shall not see my face except your brother be with 
you 
if thou wilt send our brother with us we will go down and buy 
thee food but if thou wilt not send him we will not go down 
for the man said unto us ye shall not see my face except your 
brother be with you 
and israel said wherefore dealt ye so ill with me as to tell 
the man whether ye had yet a brother and they said the man 
asked us straitly of our state and of our kindred saying is your 
father yet alive have ye another brother and we told him according 
to the tenor of these words could we certainly know that he would 
say bring your brother down and judah said unto israel his 
father send the lad with me and we will arise and go that we may 
live and not die both we and thou and also our little ones 
i will be surety for him of my hand shalt thou require him if i 
bring him not unto thee and set him before thee then let me bear the 
blame for ever for except we had lingered surely now we had 
returned this second time 
and their father israel said unto them if it must be so now do 
this take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels and carry 
down the man a present a little balm and a little honey spices and 
myrrh nuts and almonds and take double money in your hand 
and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks carry 
it again in your hand peradventure it was an oversight take 
also your brother and arise go again unto the man and god 
almighty give you mercy before the man that he may send away your 
other brother and benjamin if i be bereaved of my children i am 
bereaved 
and the men took that present and they took double money in 
their hand and benjamin and rose up and went down to egypt and 
stood before joseph 
and when joseph saw benjamin with them he said to the ruler of 
his house bring these men home and slay and make ready for these 
men shall dine with me at noon 
and the man did as joseph bade and the man brought the men into 
joseph s house 
and the men were afraid because they were brought into joseph s 
house and they said because of the money that was returned in our 
sacks at the first time are we brought in that he may seek occasion 
against us and fall upon us and take us for bondmen and our asses 
and they came near to the steward of joseph s house and they 
communed with him at the door of the house and said o sir we 
came indeed down at the first time to buy food and it came to 
pass when we came to the inn that we opened our sacks and behold 
every man s money was in the mouth of his sack our money in full 
weight and we have brought it again in our hand 
and other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food 
we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks 
and he said peace be to you fear not your god and the god of 
your father hath given you treasure in your sacks i had your money 
and he brought simeon out unto them 
and the man brought the men into joseph s house and gave them 
water and they washed their feet and he gave their asses provender 
and they made ready the present against joseph came at noon for 
they heard that they should eat bread there 
and when joseph came home they brought him the present which 
was in their hand into the house and bowed themselves to him to the 
earth 
and he asked them of their welfare and said is your father 
well the old man of whom ye spake is he yet alive and they 
answered thy servant our father is in good health he is yet alive 
and they bowed down their heads and made obeisance 
and he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother benjamin his 
mother s son and said is this your younger brother of whom ye spake 
unto me and he said god be gracious unto thee my son 
and joseph made haste for his bowels did yearn upon his 
brother and he sought where to weep and he entered into his chamber 
and wept there 
and he washed his face and went out and refrained himself and 
said set on bread 
and they set on for him by himself and for them by themselves 
and for the egyptians which did eat with him by themselves because 
the egyptians might not eat bread with the hebrews for that is an 
abomination unto the egyptians 
and they sat before him the firstborn according to his 
birthright and the youngest according to his youth and the men 
marvelled one at another 
and he took and sent messes unto them from before him but 
benjamin s mess was five times so much as any of their s and they 
drank and were merry with him 
and he commanded the steward of his house saying fill the men s 
sacks with food as much as they can carry and put every man s money 
in his sack s mouth 
and put my cup the silver cup in the sack s mouth of the 
youngest and his corn money and he did according to the word that 
joseph had spoken 
as soon as the morning was light the men were sent away they 
and their asses 
and when they were gone out of the city and not yet far off 
joseph said unto his steward up follow after the men and when thou 
dost overtake them say unto them wherefore have ye rewarded evil for 
good is not this it in which my lord drinketh and whereby 
indeed he divineth ye have done evil in so doing 
and he overtook them and he spake unto them these same words 
and they said unto him wherefore saith my lord these words god 
forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing 
behold the money which we found in our sacks mouths we brought 
again unto thee out of the land of canaan how then should we steal 
out of thy lord s house silver or gold with whomsoever of thy 
servants it be found both let him die and we also will be my lord s 
bondmen 
and he said now also let it be according unto your words he 
with whom it is found shall be my servant and ye shall be blameless 
then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground 
and opened every man his sack 
and he searched and began at the eldest and left at the 
youngest and the cup was found in benjamin s sack 
then they rent their clothes and laded every man his ass and 
returned to the city 
and judah and his brethren came to joseph s house for he was 
yet there and they fell before him on the ground 
and joseph said unto them what deed is this that ye have done 
wot ye not that such a man as i can certainly divine and judah 
said what shall we say unto my lord what shall we speak or how 
shall we clear ourselves god hath found out the iniquity of thy 
servants behold we are my lord s servants both we and he also with 
whom the cup is found 
and he said god forbid that i should do so but the man in 
whose hand the cup is found he shall be my servant and as for you 
get you up in peace unto your father 
then judah came near unto him and said oh my lord let thy 
servant i pray thee speak a word in my lord s ears and let not 
thine anger burn against thy servant for thou art even as pharaoh 
my lord asked his servants saying have ye a father or a 
brother and we said unto my lord we have a father an old 
man and a child of his old age a little one and his brother is 
dead and he alone is left of his mother and his father loveth him 
and thou saidst unto thy servants bring him down unto me that 
i may set mine eyes upon him 
and we said unto my lord the lad cannot leave his father for 
if he should leave his father his father would die 
and thou saidst unto thy servants except your youngest brother 
come down with you ye shall see my face no more 
and it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father 
we told him the words of my lord 
and our father said go again and buy us a little food 
and we said we cannot go down if our youngest brother be with 
us then will we go down for we may not see the man s face except 
our youngest brother be with us 
and thy servant my father said unto us ye know that my wife 
bare me two sons and the one went out from me and i said 
surely he is torn in pieces and i saw him not since and if ye 
take this also from me and mischief befall him ye shall bring down 
my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave 
now therefore when i come to thy servant my father and the lad 
be not with us seeing that his life is bound up in the lad s life 
it shall come to pass when he seeth that the lad is not with 
us that he will die and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs 
of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave 
for thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father 
saying if i bring him not unto thee then i shall bear the blame to 
my father for ever 
now therefore i pray thee let thy servant abide instead of the 
lad a bondman to my lord and let the lad go up with his brethren 
for how shall i go up to my father and the lad be not with me 
lest peradventure i see the evil that shall come on my father 
then joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood 
by him and he cried because every man to go out from me and there 
stood no man with him while joseph made himself known unto his 
brethren 
and he wept aloud and the egyptians and the house of pharaoh 
heard 
and joseph said unto his brethren i am joseph doth my father 
yet live and his brethren could not answer him for they were 
troubled at his presence 
and joseph said unto his brethren come near to me i pray you 
and they came near and he said i am joseph your brother whom ye 
sold into egypt 
now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that ye 
sold me hither for god did send me before you to preserve life 
for these two years hath the famine been in the land and yet 
there are five years in the which there shall neither be earing nor 
harvest 
and god sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the 
earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance 
so now it was not you that sent me hither but god and he hath 
made me a father to pharaoh and lord of all his house and a ruler 
throughout all the land of egypt 
haste ye and go up to my father and say unto him thus saith 
thy son joseph god hath made me lord of all egypt come down unto me 
tarry not and thou shalt dwell in the land of goshen and thou 
shalt be near unto me thou and thy children and thy children s 
children and thy flocks and thy herds and all that thou hast 
and there will i nourish thee for yet there are five years of famine 
lest thou and thy household and all that thou hast come to poverty 
and behold your eyes see and the eyes of my brother benjamin 
that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you 
and ye shall tell my father of all my glory in egypt and of all 
that ye have seen and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither 
and he fell upon his brother benjamin s neck and wept and 
benjamin wept upon his neck 
moreover he kissed all his brethren and wept upon them and 
after that his brethren talked with him 
and the fame thereof was heard in pharaoh s house saying 
joseph s brethren are come and it pleased pharaoh well and his 
servants 
and pharaoh said unto joseph say unto thy brethren this do ye 
lade your beasts and go get you unto the land of canaan and 
take your father and your households and come unto me and i will 
give you the good of the land of egypt and ye shall eat the fat of 
the land 
now thou art commanded this do ye take you wagons out of the 
land of egypt for your little ones and for your wives and bring your 
father and come 
also regard not your stuff for the good of all the land of 
egypt is your s 
and the children of israel did so and joseph gave them wagons 
according to the commandment of pharaoh and gave them provision for 
the way 
to all of them he gave each man changes of raiment but to 
benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of 
raiment 
and to his father he sent after this manner ten asses laden 
with the good things of egypt and ten she asses laden with corn and 
bread and meat for his father by the way 
so he sent his brethren away and they departed and he said 
unto them see that ye fall not out by the way 
and they went up out of egypt and came into the land of canaan 
unto jacob their father and told him saying joseph is yet 
alive and he is governor over all the land of egypt and jacob s 
heart fainted for he believed them not 
and they told him all the words of joseph which he had said 
unto them and when he saw the wagons which joseph had sent to carry 
him the spirit of jacob their father revived and israel said 
it is enough joseph my son is yet alive i will go and see him before 
i die 
and israel took his journey with all that he had and came to 
beersheba and offered sacrifices unto the god of his father isaac 
and god spake unto israel in the visions of the night and said 
jacob jacob and he said here am i 
and he said i am god the god of thy father fear not to go down 
into egypt for i will there make of thee a great nation i will 
go down with thee into egypt and i will also surely bring thee up 
again and joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes 
and jacob rose up from beersheba and the sons of israel carried 
jacob their father and their little ones and their wives in the 
wagons which pharaoh had sent to carry him 
and they took their cattle and their goods which they had 
gotten in the land of canaan and came into egypt jacob and all his 
seed with him his sons and his sons sons with him his 
daughters and his sons daughters and all his seed brought he with 
him into egypt 
and these are the names of the children of israel which came 
into egypt jacob and his sons reuben jacob s firstborn 
and the sons of reuben hanoch and phallu and hezron and 
carmi 
and the sons of simeon jemuel and jamin and ohad and jachin 
and zohar and shaul the son of a canaanitish woman 
and the sons of levi gershon kohath and merari 
and the sons of judah er and onan and shelah and pharez and 
zarah but er and onan died in the land of canaan and the sons of 
pharez were hezron and hamul 
and the sons of issachar tola and phuvah and job and

and the sons of zebulun sered and elon and jahleel 
these be the sons of leah which she bare unto jacob in 
padanaram with his daughter dinah all the souls of his sons and his 
daughters were thirty and three 
and the sons of gad ziphion and haggi shuni and ezbon eri 
and arodi and areli 
and the sons of asher jimnah and ishuah and isui and beriah 
and serah their sister and the sons of beriah heber and malchiel 
these are the sons of zilpah whom laban gave to leah his 
daughter and these she bare unto jacob even sixteen souls 
the sons of rachel jacob s wife joseph and benjamin 
and unto joseph in the land of egypt were born manasseh and 
ephraim which asenath the daughter of potipherah priest of on bare 
unto him 
and the sons of benjamin were belah and becher and ashbel 
gera and naaman ehi and rosh muppim and huppim and ard 
these are the sons of rachel which were born to jacob all the 
souls were fourteen 
and the sons of dan hushim 
and the sons of naphtali jahzeel and guni and jezer and

these are the sons of bilhah which laban gave unto rachel his

all the souls that came with jacob into egypt which came out of 
his loins besides jacob s sons wives all the souls were threescore 
and six and the sons of joseph which were born him in egypt 
were two souls all the souls of the house of jacob which came into 
egypt were threescore and ten 
and he sent judah before him unto joseph to direct his face 
unto goshen and they came into the land of goshen 
and joseph made ready his chariot and went up to meet israel 
his father to goshen and presented himself unto him and he fell on 
his neck and wept on his neck a good while 
and israel said unto joseph now let me die since i have seen 
thy face because thou art yet alive 
and joseph said unto his brethren and unto his father s house 
i will go up and shew pharaoh and say unto him my brethren and my 
father s house which were in the land of canaan are come unto me 
and the men are shepherds for their trade hath been to feed 
cattle and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all 
that they have 
and it shall come to pass when pharaoh shall call you and 
shall say what is your occupation that ye shall say thy 
servants trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now 
both we and also our fathers that ye may dwell in the land of 
goshen for every shepherd is an abomination unto the egyptians 
then joseph came and told pharaoh and said my father and my 
brethren and their flocks and their herds and all that they have 
are come out of the land of canaan and behold they are in the land 
of goshen 
and he took some of his brethren even five men and presented 
them unto pharaoh 
and pharaoh said unto his brethren what is your occupation and 
they said unto pharaoh thy servants are shepherds both we and also 
our fathers 
they said morever unto pharaoh for to sojourn in the land are we 
come for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks for the 
famine is sore in the land of canaan now therefore we pray thee let 
thy servants dwell in the land of goshen 
and pharaoh spake unto joseph saying thy father and thy 
brethren are come unto thee the land of egypt is before thee in 
the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell in the 
land of goshen let them dwell and if thou knowest any men of activity 
among them then make them rulers over my cattle 
and joseph brought in jacob his father and set him before 
pharaoh and jacob blessed pharaoh 
and pharaoh said unto jacob how old art thou and jacob 
said unto pharaoh the days of the years of my pilgrimage are an 
hundred and thirty years few and evil have the days of the years of 
my life been and have not attained unto the days of the years of the 
life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage 
and jacob blessed pharaoh and went out from before pharaoh 
and joseph placed his father and his brethren and gave them a 
possession in the land of egypt in the best of the land in the land 
of rameses as pharaoh had commanded 
and joseph nourished his father and his brethren and all his 
father s household with bread according to their families 
and there was no bread in all the land for the famine was very 
sore so that the land of egypt and all the land of canaan fainted by 
reason of the famine 
and joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land 
of egypt and in the land of canaan for the corn which they bought 
and joseph brought the money into pharaoh s house 
and when money failed in the land of egypt and in the land of 
canaan all the egyptians came unto joseph and said give us bread 
for why should we die in thy presence for the money faileth 
and joseph said give your cattle and i will give you for your 
cattle if money fail 
and they brought their cattle unto joseph and joseph gave them 
bread in exchange for horses and for the flocks and for the cattle 
of the herds and for the asses and he fed them with bread for all 
their cattle for that year 
when that year was ended they came unto him the second year 
and said unto him we will not hide it from my lord how that our 
money is spent my lord also hath our herds of cattle there is not 
ought left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our lands 
wherefore shall we die before thine eyes both we and our land 
buy us and our land for bread and we and our land will be servants 
unto pharaoh and give us seed that we may live and not die that 
the land be not desolate 
and joseph bought all the land of egypt for pharaoh for the 
egyptians sold every man his field because the famine prevailed over 
them so the land became pharaoh s 
and as for the people he removed them to cities from one end of 
the borders of egypt even to the other end thereof 
only the land of the priests bought he not for the priests had 
a portion assigned them of pharaoh and did eat their portion which 
pharaoh gave them wherefore they sold not their lands 
then joseph said unto the people behold i have bought you this 
day and your land for pharaoh lo here is seed for you and ye shall 
sow the land 
and it shall come to pass in the increase that ye shall give 
the fifth part unto pharaoh and four parts shall be your own for 
seed of the field and for your food and for them of your households 
and for food for your little ones 
and they said thou hast saved our lives let us find grace in 
the sight of my lord and we will be pharaoh s servants 
and joseph made it a law over the land of egypt unto this day 
that pharaoh should have the fifth part except the land of the 
priests only which became not pharaoh s 
and israel dwelt in the land of egypt in the country of goshen 
and they had possessions therein and grew and multiplied 
exceedingly 
and jacob lived in the land of egypt seventeen years so the 
whole age of jacob was an hundred forty and seven years 
and the time drew nigh that israel must die and he called his 
son joseph and said unto him if now i have found grace in thy sight 
put i pray thee thy hand under my thigh and deal kindly and truly 
with me bury me not i pray thee in egypt but i will lie with 
my fathers and thou shalt carry me out of egypt and bury me in their 
buryingplace and he said i will do as thou hast said 
and he said swear unto me and he sware unto him and israel 
bowed himself upon the bed s head 
and it came to pass after these things that one told joseph 
behold thy father is sick and he took with him his two sons 
manasseh and ephraim 
and one told jacob and said behold thy son joseph cometh unto 
thee and israel strengthened himself and sat upon the bed 
and jacob said unto joseph god almighty appeared unto me at luz 
in the land of canaan and blessed me and said unto me behold 
i will make thee fruitful and multiply thee and i will make of thee 
a multitude of people and will give this land to thy seed after thee 
for an everlasting possession 
and now thy two sons ephraim and manasseh which were born unto 
thee in the land of egypt before i came unto thee into egypt are 
mine as reuben and simeon they shall be mine 
and thy issue which thou begettest after them shall be thine 
and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their 
inheritance 
and as for me when i came from padan rachel died by me in the 
land of canaan in the way when yet there was but a little way to come 
unto ephrath and i buried her there in the way of ephrath the same 
is bethlehem 
and israel beheld joseph s sons and said who are these 
and joseph said unto his father they are my sons whom god hath given 
me in this place and he said bring them i pray thee unto me and i 
will bless them 
now the eyes of israel were dim for age so that he could not 
see 
and he brought them near unto him and he kissed them and embraced 
them 
and israel said unto joseph i had not thought to see thy face 
and lo god hath shewed me also thy seed 
and joseph brought them out from between his knees and he bowed 
himself with his face to the earth 
and joseph took them both ephraim in his right hand toward 
israel s left hand and manasseh in his left hand toward israel s 
right hand and brought them near unto him 
and israel stretched out his right hand and laid it upon 
ephraim s head who was the younger and his left hand upon manasseh s 
head guiding his hands wittingly for manasseh was the firstborn 
and he blessed joseph and said god before whom my fathers 
abraham and isaac did walk the god which fed me all my life long unto 
this day the angel which redeemed me from all evil bless the 
lads and let my name be named on them and the name of my fathers 
abraham and isaac and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of 
the earth 
and when joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the 
head of ephraim it displeased him and he held up his father s hand 
to remove it from ephraim s head unto manasseh s head 
and joseph said unto his father not so my father for this is 
the firstborn put thy right hand upon his head 
and his father refused and said i know it my son i know it 
he also shall become a people and he also shall be great but truly 
his younger brother shall be greater than he and his seed shall 
become a multitude of nations 
and he blessed them that day saying in thee shall israel 
bless saying god make thee as ephraim and as manasseh and he set 
ephraim before manasseh 
and israel said unto joseph behold i die but god shall be 
with you and bring you again unto the land of your fathers 
moreover i have given to thee one portion above thy brethren 
which i took out of the hand of the amorite with my sword and with my 
bow 
and jacob called unto his sons and said gather yourselves 
together that i may tell you that which shall befall you in the last 
days 
gather yourselves together and hear ye sons of jacob and 
hearken unto israel your father 
reuben thou art my firstborn my might and the beginning of my 
strength the excellency of dignity and the excellency of power 
unstable as water thou shalt not excel because thou wentest up to 
thy father s bed then defiledst thou it he went up to my couch 
simeon and levi are brethren instruments of cruelty are in their 
habitations 
o my soul come not thou into their secret unto their assembly 
mine honour be not thou united for in their anger they slew a man 
and in their selfwill they digged down a wall 
cursed be their anger for it was fierce and their wrath for it 
was cruel i will divide them in jacob and scatter them in israel 
judah thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise thy hand shall 
be in the neck of thine enemies thy father s children shall bow down 
before thee 
judah is a lion s whelp from the prey my son thou art gone up 
he stooped down he couched as a lion and as an old lion who shall 
rouse him up the sceptre shall not depart from judah nor a 
lawgiver from between his feet until shiloh come and unto him shall 
the gathering of the people be 
binding his foal unto the vine and his ass s colt unto the 
choice vine he washed his garments in wine and his clothes in the 
blood of grapes his eyes shall be red with wine and his teeth 
white with milk 
zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea and he shall be for 
an haven of ships and his border shall be unto zidon 
issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens 
and he saw that rest was good and the land that it was 
pleasant and bowed his shoulder to bear and became a servant unto 
tribute 
dan shall judge his people as one of the tribes of israel 
dan shall be a serpent by the way an adder in the path that 
biteth the horse heels so that his rider shall fall backward 
i have waited for thy salvation o lord 
gad a troop shall overcome him but he shall overcome at the 
last 
out of asher his bread shall be fat and he shall yield royal 
dainties 
naphtali is a hind let loose he giveth goodly words 
joseph is a fruitful bough even a fruitful bough by a well 
whose branches run over the wall the archers have sorely 
grieved him and shot at him and hated him but his bow abode 
in strength and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands 
of the mighty god of jacob from thence is the shepherd the stone of 
israel even by the god of thy father who shall help thee and 
by the almighty who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above 
blessings of the deep that lieth under blessings of the breasts and 
of the womb the blessings of thy father have prevailed above 
the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the 
everlasting hills they shall be on the head of joseph and on the 
crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren 
benjamin shall ravin as a wolf in the morning he shall devour 
the prey and at night he shall divide the spoil 
all these are the twelve tribes of israel and this is it that 
their father spake unto them and blessed them every one according to 
his blessing he blessed them 
and he charged them and said unto them i am to be gathered 
unto my people bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the 
field of ephron the hittite in the cave that is in the field of 
machpelah which is before mamre in the land of canaan which abraham 
bought with the field of ephron the hittite for a possession of a 
buryingplace 
there they buried abraham and sarah his wife there they buried 
isaac and rebekah his wife and there i buried leah 
the purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was 
from the children of heth 
and when jacob had made an end of commanding his sons he 
gathered up his feet into the bed and yielded up the ghost and was 
gathered unto his people 
and joseph fell upon his father s face and wept upon him and 
kissed him 
and joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his 
father and the physicians embalmed israel 
and forty days were fulfilled for him for so are fulfilled the 
days of those which are embalmed and the egyptians mourned for him 
threescore and ten days 
and when the days of his mourning were past joseph spake unto 
the house of pharaoh saying if now i have found grace in your eyes 
speak i pray you in the ears of pharaoh saying my father made 
me swear saying lo i die in my grave which i have digged for me in 
the land of canaan there shalt thou bury me now therefore let me go 
up i pray thee and bury my father and i will come again 
and pharaoh said go up and bury thy father according as he 
made thee swear 
and joseph went up to bury his father and with him went up all 
the servants of pharaoh the elders of his house and all the elders 
of the land of egypt and all the house of joseph and his 
brethren and his father s house only their little ones and their 
flocks and their herds they left in the land of goshen 
and there went up with him both chariots and horsemen and it was 
a very great company 
and they came to the threshingfloor of atad which is beyond 
jordan and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation 
and he made a mourning for his father seven days 
and when the inhabitants of the land the canaanites saw the 
mourning in the floor of atad they said this is a grievous mourning 
to the egyptians wherefore the name of it was called abelmizraim 
which is beyond jordan 
and his sons did unto him according as he commanded them 
for his sons carried him into the land of canaan and buried him in 
the cave of the field of machpelah which abraham bought with the 
field for a possession of a buryingplace of ephron the hittite before 
mamre 
and joseph returned into egypt he and his brethren and all 
that went up with him to bury his father after he had buried his 
father 
and when joseph s brethren saw that their father was dead they 
said joseph will peradventure hate us and will certainly requite us 
all the evil which we did unto him 
and they sent a messenger unto joseph saying thy father did 
command before he died saying so shall ye say unto joseph 
forgive i pray thee now the trespass of thy brethren and their sin 
for they did unto thee evil and now we pray thee forgive the 
trespass of the servants of the god of thy father and joseph wept 
when they spake unto him 
and his brethren also went and fell down before his face and 
they said behold we be thy servants 
and joseph said unto them fear not for am i in the place of 
god but as for you ye thought evil against me but god meant 
it unto good to bring to pass as it is this day to save much people 
alive 
now therefore fear ye not i will nourish you and your little 
ones 
and he comforted them and spake kindly unto them 
and joseph dwelt in egypt he and his father s house and 
joseph lived an hundred and ten years 
and joseph saw ephraim s children of the third generation the 
children also of machir the son of manasseh were brought up upon 
joseph s knees 
and joseph said unto his brethren i die and god will surely 
visit you and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware 
to abraham to isaac and to jacob 
and joseph took an oath of the children of israel saying god 
will surely visit you and ye shall carry up my bones from hence 
so joseph died being an hundred and ten years old and they 
embalmed him and he was put in a coffin in egypt 
the second book of moses called exodus 
now these are the names of the children of israel which came 
into egypt every man and his household came with jacob 
reuben simeon levi and judah issachar zebulun and 
benjamin dan and naphtali gad and asher 
and all the souls that came out of the loins of jacob were seventy 
souls for joseph was in egypt already 
and joseph died and all his brethren and all that generation 
and the children of israel were fruitful and increased 
abundantly and multiplied and waxed exceeding mighty and the land 
was filled with them 
now there arose up a new king over egypt which knew not joseph 
and he said unto his people behold the people of the children of 
israel are more and mightier than we come on let us deal wisely 
with them lest they multiply and it come to pass that when there 
falleth out any war they join also unto our enemies and fight 
against us and so get them up out of the land 
therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with 
their burdens and they built for pharaoh treasure cities pithom and 
raamses 
but the more they afflicted them the more they multiplied and 
grew 
and they were grieved because of the children of israel 
and the egyptians made the children of israel to serve with 
rigour and they made their lives bitter with hard bondage in 
morter and in brick and in all manner of service in the field all 
their service wherein they made them serve was with rigour 
and the king of egypt spake to the hebrew midwives of which the 
name of the one was shiphrah and the name of the other puah and 
he said when ye do the office of a midwife to the hebrew women and 
see them upon the stools if it be a son then ye shall kill him but 
if it be a daughter then she shall live 
but the midwives feared god and did not as the king of egypt 
commanded them but saved the men children alive 
and the king of egypt called for the midwives and said unto 
them why have ye done this thing and have saved the men children 
alive and the midwives said unto pharaoh because the hebrew 
women are not as the egyptian women for they are lively and are 
delivered ere the midwives come in unto them 
therefore god dealt well with the midwives and the people 
multiplied and waxed very mighty 
and it came to pass because the midwives feared god that he 
made them houses 
and pharaoh charged all his people saying every son that is 
born ye shall cast into the river and every daughter ye shall save 
alive 
and there went a man of the house of levi and took to wife a 
daughter of levi 
and the woman conceived and bare a son and when she saw him that 
he was a goodly child she hid him three months 
and when she could not longer hide him she took for him an ark of 
bulrushes and daubed it with slime and with pitch and put the child 
therein and she laid it in the flags by the river s brink 
and his sister stood afar off to wit what would be done to him 
and the daughter of pharaoh came down to wash herself at the 
river and her maidens walked along by the river s side and when she 
saw the ark among the flags she sent her maid to fetch it 
and when she had opened it she saw the child and behold the 
babe wept and she had compassion on him and said this is one of the 
hebrews children 
then said his sister to pharaoh s daughter shall i go and call to 
thee a nurse of the hebrew women that she may nurse the child for 
thee and pharaoh s daughter said to her go and the maid went 
and called the child s mother 
and pharaoh s daughter said unto her take this child away and 
nurse it for me and i will give thee thy wages and the women took 
the child and nursed it 
and the child grew and she brought him unto pharaoh s daughter 
and he became her son and she called his name moses and she said 
because i drew him out of the water 
and it came to pass in those days when moses was grown that he 
went out unto his brethren and looked on their burdens and he spied 
an egyptian smiting an hebrew one of his brethren 
and he looked this way and that way and when he saw that there 
was no man he slew the egyptian and hid him in the sand 
and when he went out the second day behold two men of the 
hebrews strove together and he said to him that did the wrong 
wherefore smitest thou thy fellow and he said who made thee a 
prince and a judge over us intendest thou to kill me as thou 
killedst the egyptian and moses feared and said surely this thing 
is known 
now when pharaoh heard this thing he sought to slay moses but 
moses fled from the face of pharaoh and dwelt in the land of midian 
and he sat down by a well 
now the priest of midian had seven daughters and they came and 
drew water and filled the troughs to water their father s flock 
and the shepherds came and drove them away but moses stood up 
and helped them and watered their flock 
and when they came to reuel their father he said how is it that 
ye are come so soon to day and they said an egyptian delivered 
us out of the hand of the shepherds and also drew water enough for 
us and watered the flock 
and he said unto his daughters and where is he why is it that 
ye have left the man call him that he may eat bread 
and moses was content to dwell with the man and he gave moses 
zipporah his daughter 
and she bare him a son and he called his name gershom for he 
said i have been a stranger in a strange land 
and it came to pass in process of time that the king of egypt 
died and the children of israel sighed by reason of the bondage and 
they cried and their cry came up unto god by reason of the bondage 
and god heard their groaning and god remembered his covenant 
with abraham with isaac and with jacob 
and god looked upon the children of israel and god had respect 
unto them 
now moses kept the flock of jethro his father in law the priest 
of midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and 
came to the mountain of god even to horeb 
and the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out 
of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned 
with fire and the bush was not consumed 
and moses said i will now turn aside and see this great sight 
why the bush is not burnt 
and when the lord saw that he turned aside to see god called unto 
him out of the midst of the bush and said moses moses and he said 
here am i 
and he said draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes from off thy 
feet for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground 
moreover he said i am the god of thy father the god of abraham 
the god of isaac and the god of jacob and moses hid his face for he 
was afraid to look upon god 
and the lord said i have surely seen the affliction of my people 
which are in egypt and have heard their cry by reason of their 
taskmasters for i know their sorrows and i am come down to 
deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians and to bring them up 
out of that land unto a good land and a large unto a land flowing 
with milk and honey unto the place of the canaanites and the 
hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and 
the jebusites 
now therefore behold the cry of the children of israel is come 
unto me and i have also seen the oppression wherewith the egyptians 
oppress them 
come now therefore and i will send thee unto pharaoh that thou 
mayest bring forth my people the children of israel out of egypt 
and moses said unto god who am i that i should go unto pharaoh 
and that i should bring forth the children of israel out of egypt 
and he said certainly i will be with thee and this shall be a 
token unto thee that i have sent thee when thou hast brought forth 
the people out of egypt ye shall serve god upon this mountain 
and moses said unto god behold when i come unto the children of 
israel and shall say unto them the god of your fathers hath sent me 
unto you and they shall say to me what is his name what shall i say 
unto them and god said unto moses i am that i am and he said 
thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel i am hath sent me 
unto you 
and god said moreover unto moses thus shalt thou say unto the 
children of israel the lord god of your fathers the god of abraham 
the god of isaac and the god of jacob hath sent me unto you this is 
my name for ever and this is my memorial unto all generations 
go and gather the elders of israel together and say unto them 
the lord god of your fathers the god of abraham of isaac and of 
jacob appeared unto me saying i have surely visited you and seen 
that which is done to you in egypt and i have said i will bring 
you up out of the affliction of egypt unto the land of the canaanites 
and the hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the 
hivites and the jebusites unto a land flowing with milk and honey 
and they shall hearken to thy voice and thou shalt come thou 
and the elders of israel unto the king of egypt and ye shall say 
unto him the lord god of the hebrews hath met with us and now let us 
go we beseech thee three days journey into the wilderness that we 
may sacrifice to the lord our god 
and i am sure that the king of egypt will not let you go no not 
by a mighty hand 
and i will stretch out my hand and smite egypt with all my 
wonders which i will do in the midst thereof and after that he will 
let you go 
and i will give this people favour in the sight of the egyptians 
and it shall come to pass that when ye go ye shall not go empty 
but every woman shall borrow of her neighbour and of her that 
sojourneth in her house jewels of silver and jewels of gold and 
raiment and ye shall put them upon your sons and upon your 
daughters and ye shall spoil the egyptians 
and moses answered and said but behold they will not believe 
me nor hearken unto my voice for they will say the lord hath not 
appeared unto thee 
and the lord said unto him what is that in thine hand and he 
said a rod 
and he said cast it on the ground and he cast it on the ground 
and it became a serpent and moses fled from before it 
and the lord said unto moses put forth thine hand and take it by 
the tail and he put forth his hand and caught it and it became a 
rod in his hand that they may believe that the lord god of their 
fathers the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob 
hath appeared unto thee 
and the lord said furthermore unto him put now thine hand into 
thy bosom and he put his hand into his bosom and when he took it 
out behold his hand was leprous as snow 
and he said put thine hand into thy bosom again and he put his 
hand into his bosom again and plucked it out of his bosom and 
behold it was turned again as his other flesh 
and it shall come to pass if they will not believe thee neither 
hearken to the voice of the first sign that they will believe the 
voice of the latter sign 
and it shall come to pass if they will not believe also these two 
signs neither hearken unto thy voice that thou shalt take of the 
water of the river and pour it upon the dry land and the water which 
thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land 
and moses said unto the lord o my lord i am not eloquent 
neither heretofore nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant but i 
am slow of speech and of a slow tongue 
and the lord said unto him who hath made man s mouth or who 
maketh the dumb or deaf or the seeing or the blind have not i the 
lord now therefore go and i will be with thy mouth and teach 
thee what thou shalt say 
and he said o my lord send i pray thee by the hand of him 
whom thou wilt send 
and the anger of the lord was kindled against moses and he said 
is not aaron the levite thy brother i know that he can speak well 
and also behold he cometh forth to meet thee and when he seeth 
thee he will be glad in his heart 
and thou shalt speak unto him and put words in his mouth and i 
will be with thy mouth and with his mouth and will teach you what ye 
shall do 
and he shall be thy spokesman unto the people and he shall be 
even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth and thou shalt be to him 
instead of god 
and thou shalt take this rod in thine hand wherewith thou shalt 
do signs 
and moses went and returned to jethro his father in law and said 
unto him let me go i pray thee and return unto my brethren which 
are in egypt and see whether they be yet alive and jethro said to 
moses go in peace 
and the lord said unto moses in midian go return into egypt 
for all the men are dead which sought thy life 
and moses took his wife and his sons and set them upon an ass 
and he returned to the land of egypt and moses took the rod of god in 
his hand 
and the lord said unto moses when thou goest to return into 
egypt see that thou do all those wonders before pharaoh which i have 
put in thine hand but i will harden his heart that he shall not let 
the people go 
and thou shalt say unto pharaoh thus saith the lord israel is 
my son even my firstborn and i say unto thee let my son go 
that he may serve me and if thou refuse to let him go behold i will 
slay thy son even thy firstborn 
and it came to pass by the way in the inn that the lord met him 
and sought to kill him 
then zipporah took a sharp stone and cut off the foreskin of her 
son and cast it at his feet and said surely a bloody husband art 
thou to me 
so he let him go then she said a bloody husband thou art 
because of the circumcision 
and the lord said to aaron go into the wilderness to meet moses 
and he went and met him in the mount of god and kissed him 
and moses told aaron all the words of the lord who had sent him 
and all the signs which he had commanded him 
and moses and aaron went and gathered together all the elders of 
the children of israel and aaron spake all the words which the 
lord had spoken unto moses and did the signs in the sight of the 
people 
and the people believed and when they heard that the lord had 
visited the children of israel and that he had looked upon their 
affliction then they bowed their heads and worshipped 
and afterward moses and aaron went in and told pharaoh thus 
saith the lord god of israel let my people go that they may hold a 
feast unto me in the wilderness 
and pharaoh said who is the lord that i should obey his voice to 
let israel go i know not the lord neither will i let israel go 
and they said the god of the hebrews hath met with us let us go 
we pray thee three days journey into the desert and sacrifice unto 
the lord our god lest he fall upon us with pestilence or with the 
sword 
and the king of egypt said unto them wherefore do ye moses and 
aaron let the people from their works get you unto your burdens 
and pharaoh said behold the people of the land now are many and 
ye make them rest from their burdens 
and pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people 
and their officers saying ye shall no more give the people straw 
to make brick as heretofore let them go and gather straw for 
themselves 
and the tale of the bricks which they did make heretofore ye 
shall lay upon them ye shall not diminish ought thereof for they be 
idle therefore they cry saying let us go and sacrifice to our god 
let there more work be laid upon the men that they may labour 
therein and let them not regard vain words 
and the taskmasters of the people went out and their officers 
and they spake to the people saying thus saith pharaoh i will not 
give you straw 
go ye get you straw where ye can find it yet not ought of your 
work shall be diminished 
so the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of 
egypt to gather stubble instead of straw 
and the taskmasters hasted them saying fulfil your works your 
daily tasks as when there was straw 
and the officers of the children of israel which pharaoh s 
taskmasters had set over them were beaten and demanded wherefore 
have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to 
day as heretofore then the officers of the children of israel 
came and cried unto pharaoh saying wherefore dealest thou thus with 
thy servants there is no straw given unto thy servants and 
they say to us make brick and behold thy servants are beaten but 
the fault is in thine own people 
but he said ye are idle ye are idle therefore ye say let us 
go and do sacrifice to the lord 
go therefore now and work for there shall no straw be given 
you yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks 
and the officers of the children of israel did see that they were 
in evil case after it was said ye shall not minish ought from your 
bricks of your daily task 
and they met moses and aaron who stood in the way as they came 
forth from pharaoh and they said unto them the lord look upon 
you and judge because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the 
eyes of pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants to put a sword in 
their hand to slay us 
and moses returned unto the lord and said lord wherefore hast 
thou so evil entreated this people why is it that thou hast sent me 
for since i came to pharaoh to speak in thy name he hath done 
evil to this people neither hast thou delivered thy people at all 
then the lord said unto moses now shalt thou see what i will do 
to pharaoh for with a strong hand shall he let them go and with a 
strong hand shall he drive them out of his land 
and god spake unto moses and said unto him i am the lord 
and i appeared unto abraham unto isaac and unto jacob by the name 
of god almighty but by my name jehovah was i not known to them 
and i have also established my covenant with them to give them 
the land of canaan the land of their pilgrimage wherein they were 
strangers 
and i have also heard the groaning of the children of israel whom 
the egyptians keep in bondage and i have remembered my covenant 
wherefore say unto the children of israel i am the lord and i 
will bring you out from under the burdens of the egyptians and i will 
rid you out of their bondage and i will redeem you with a stretched 
out arm and with great judgments and i will take you to me for a 
people and i will be to you a god and ye shall know that i am the 
lord your god which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the 
egyptians 
and i will bring you in unto the land concerning the which i did 
swear to give it to abraham to isaac and to jacob and i will give 
it you for an heritage i am the lord 
and moses spake so unto the children of israel but they hearkened 
not unto moses for anguish of spirit and for cruel bondage 
and the lord spake unto moses saying go in speak unto 
pharaoh king of egypt that he let the children of israel go out of 
his land 
and moses spake before the lord saying behold the children of 
israel have not hearkened unto me how then shall pharaoh hear me who 
am of uncircumcised lips and the lord spake unto moses and unto 
aaron and gave them a charge unto the children of israel and unto 
pharaoh king of egypt to bring the children of israel out of the land 
of egypt 
these be the heads of their fathers houses the sons of reuben 
the firstborn of israel hanoch and pallu hezron and carmi these 
be the families of reuben 
and the sons of simeon jemuel and jamin and ohad and jachin 
and zohar and shaul the son of a canaanitish woman these are the

bare him aaron and moses and the years of the life of amram were an 
hundred and thirty and seven years 
and the sons of izhar korah and nepheg and zichri 
and the sons of uzziel mishael and elzaphan and zithri

and eleazar aaron s son took him one of the daughters of putiel 
to wife and she bare him phinehas these are the heads of the fathers

these are that aaron and moses to whom the lord said bring out 
the children of israel from the land of egypt according to their 
armies 
these are they which spake to pharaoh king of egypt to bring out 
the children of israel from egypt these are that moses and aaron 
and it came to pass on the day when the lord spake unto moses in 
the land of egypt that the lord spake unto moses saying i am 
the lord speak thou unto pharaoh king of egypt all that i say unto 
thee 
and moses said before the lord behold i am of uncircumcised 
lips and how shall pharaoh hearken unto me and the lord said 
unto moses see i have made thee a god to pharaoh and aaron thy 
brother shall be thy prophet 
thou shalt speak all that i command thee and aaron thy brother 
shall speak unto pharaoh that he send the children of israel out of 
his land 
and i will harden pharaoh s heart and multiply my signs and my 
wonders in the land of egypt 
but pharaoh shall not hearken unto you that i may lay my hand 
upon egypt and bring forth mine armies and my people the children of 
israel out of the land of egypt by great judgments 
and the egyptians shall know that i am the lord when i stretch 
forth mine hand upon egypt and bring out the children of israel from 
among them 
and moses and aaron did as the lord commanded them so did they 
and moses was fourscore years old and aaron fourscore and three 
years old when they spake unto pharaoh 
and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron saying when 
pharaoh shall speak unto you saying shew a miracle for you then 
thou shalt say unto aaron take thy rod and cast it before pharaoh 
and it shall become a serpent 
and moses and aaron went in unto pharaoh and they did so as the 
lord had commanded and aaron cast down his rod before pharaoh and 
before his servants and it became a serpent 
then pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers now the 
magicians of egypt they also did in like manner with their 
enchantments 
for they cast down every man his rod and they became serpents 
but aaron s rod swallowed up their rods 
and he hardened pharaoh s heart that he hearkened not unto them 
as the lord had said 
and the lord said unto moses pharaoh s heart is hardened he 
refuseth to let the people go 
get thee unto pharaoh in the morning lo he goeth out unto the 
water and thou shalt stand by the river s brink against he come and 
the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand 
and thou shalt say unto him the lord god of the hebrews hath 
sent me unto thee saying let my people go that they may serve me in 
the wilderness and behold hitherto thou wouldest not hear 
thus saith the lord in this thou shalt know that i am the lord 
behold i will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters 
which are in the river and they shall be turned to blood 
and the fish that is in the river shall die and the river shall 
stink and the egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the 
river 
and the lord spake unto moses say unto aaron take thy rod and 
stretch out thine hand upon the waters of egypt upon their streams 
upon their rivers and upon their ponds and upon all their pools of 
water that they may become blood and that there may be blood 
throughout all the land of egypt both in vessels of wood and in 
vessels of stone 
and moses and aaron did so as the lord commanded and he lifted 
up the rod and smote the waters that were in the river in the sight 
of pharaoh and in the sight of his servants and all the waters that 
were in the river were turned to blood 
and the fish that was in the river died and the river stank and 
the egyptians could not drink of the water of the river and there was 
blood throughout all the land of egypt 
and the magicians of egypt did so with their enchantments and 
pharaoh s heart was hardened neither did he hearken unto them as the 
lord had said 
and pharaoh turned and went into his house neither did he set 
his heart to this also 
and all the egyptians digged round about the river for water to 
drink for they could not drink of the water of the river 
and seven days were fulfilled after that the lord had smitten 
the river 
and the lord spake unto moses go unto pharaoh and say unto him 
thus saith the lord let my people go that they may serve me 
and if thou refuse to let them go behold i will smite all thy 
borders with frogs and the river shall bring forth frogs 
abundantly which shall go up and come into thine house and into thy 
bedchamber and upon thy bed and into the house of thy servants and 
upon thy people and into thine ovens and into thy kneadingtroughs 
and the frogs shall come up both on thee and upon thy people and 
upon all thy servants 
and the lord spake unto moses say unto aaron stretch forth thine 
hand with thy rod over the streams over the rivers and over the 
ponds and because frogs to come up upon the land of egypt 
and aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of egypt and the 
frogs came up and covered the land of egypt 
and the magicians did so with their enchantments and brought up 
frogs upon the land of egypt 
then pharaoh called for moses and aaron and said intreat the 
lord that he may take away the frogs from me and from my people and 
i will let the people go that they may do sacrifice unto the lord 
and moses said unto pharaoh glory over me when shall i intreat 
for thee and for thy servants and for thy people to destroy the 
frogs from thee and thy houses that they may remain in the river 
only and he said to morrow and he said be it according to 
thy word that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the lord 
our god 
and the frogs shall depart from thee and from thy houses and 
from thy servants and from thy people they shall remain in the river 
only 
and moses and aaron went out from pharaoh and moses cried unto 
the lord because of the frogs which he had brought against pharaoh 
and the lord did according to the word of moses and the frogs 
died out of the houses out of the villages and out of the fields 
and they gathered them together upon heaps and the land stank 
but when pharaoh saw that there was respite he hardened his 
heart and hearkened not unto them as the lord had said 
and the lord said unto moses say unto aaron stretch out thy 
rod and smite the dust of the land that it may become lice 
throughout all the land of egypt 
and they did so for aaron stretched out his hand with his rod 
and smote the dust of the earth and it became lice in man and in 
beast all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of 
egypt 
and the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth 
lice but they could not so there were lice upon man and upon beast 
then the magicians said unto pharaoh this is the finger of god 
and pharaoh s heart was hardened and he hearkened not unto them as 
the lord had said 
and the lord said unto moses rise up early in the morning and 
stand before pharaoh lo he cometh forth to the water and say unto 
him thus saith the lord let my people go that they may serve me 
else if thou wilt not let my people go behold i will send 
swarms of flies upon thee and upon thy servants and upon thy people 
and into thy houses and the houses of the egyptians shall be full of 
swarms of flies and also the ground whereon they are 
and i will sever in that day the land of goshen in which my 
people dwell that no swarms of flies shall be there to the end thou 
mayest know that i am the lord in the midst of the earth 
and i will put a division between my people and thy people to 
morrow shall this sign be 
and the lord did so and there came a grievous swarm of flies 
into the house of pharaoh and into his servants houses and into all 
the land of egypt the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of 
flies 
and pharaoh called for moses and for aaron and said go ye 
sacrifice to your god in the land 
and moses said it is not meet so to do for we shall sacrifice 
the abomination of the egyptians to the lord our god lo shall we 
sacrifice the abomination of the egyptians before their eyes and will 
they not stone us we will go three days journey into the 
wilderness and sacrifice to the lord our god as he shall command us 
and pharaoh said i will let you go that ye may sacrifice to the 
lord your god in the wilderness only ye shall not go very far away 
intreat for me 
and moses said behold i go out from thee and i will intreat 
the lord that the swarms of flies may depart from pharaoh from his 
servants and from his people to morrow but let not pharaoh deal 
deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the 
lord 
and moses went out from pharaoh and intreated the lord 
and the lord did according to the word of moses and he removed 
the swarms of flies from pharaoh from his servants and from his 
people there remained not one 
and pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also neither would 
he let the people go 
then the lord said unto moses go in unto pharaoh and tell him 
thus saith the lord god of the hebrews let my people go that they 
may serve me 
for if thou refuse to let them go and wilt hold them still 
behold the hand of the lord is upon thy cattle which is in the field 
upon the horses upon the asses upon the camels upon the oxen and 
upon the sheep there shall be a very grievous murrain 
and the lord shall sever between the cattle of israel and the 
cattle of egypt and there shall nothing die of all that is the 
children s of israel 
and the lord appointed a set time saying to morrow the lord 
shall do this thing in the land 
and the lord did that thing on the morrow and all the cattle of 
egypt died but of the cattle of the children of israel died not one 
and pharaoh sent and behold there was not one of the cattle of 
the israelites dead and the heart of pharaoh was hardened and he did 
not let the people go 
and the lord said unto moses and unto aaron take to you handfuls 
of ashes of the furnace and let moses sprinkle it toward the heaven 
in the sight of pharaoh 
and it shall become small dust in all the land of egypt and shall 
be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast 
throughout all the land of egypt 
and they took ashes of the furnace and stood before pharaoh and 
moses sprinkled it up toward heaven and it became a boil breaking 
forth with blains upon man and upon beast 
and the magicians could not stand before moses because of the 
boils for the boil was upon the magicians and upon all the 
egyptians 
and the lord hardened the heart of pharaoh and he hearkened not 
unto them as the lord had spoken unto moses 
and the lord said unto moses rise up early in the morning and 
stand before pharaoh and say unto him thus saith the lord god of the 
hebrews let my people go that they may serve me 
for i will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart and 
upon thy servants and upon thy people that thou mayest know that 
there is none like me in all the earth 
for now i will stretch out my hand that i may smite thee and thy 
people with pestilence and thou shalt be cut off from the earth 
and in very deed for this because have i raised thee up for to 
shew in thee my power and that my name may be declared throughout all 
the earth 
as yet exaltest thou thyself against my people that thou wilt 
not let them go behold to morrow about this time i will cause 
it to rain a very grievous hail such as hath not been in egypt since 
the foundation thereof even until now 
send therefore now and gather thy cattle and all that thou hast 
in the field for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the 
field and shall not be brought home the hail shall come down upon 
them and they shall die 
he that feared the word of the lord among the servants of pharaoh 
made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses and he 
that regarded not the word of the lord left his servants and his 
cattle in the field 
and the lord said unto moses stretch forth thine hand toward 
heaven that there may be hail in all the land of egypt upon man and 
upon beast and upon every herb of the field throughout the land of 
egypt 
and moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven and the lord 
sent thunder and hail and the fire ran along upon the ground and the 
lord rained hail upon the land of egypt 
so there was hail and fire mingled with the hail very grievous 
such as there was none like it in all the land of egypt since it 
became a nation 
and the hail smote throughout all the land of egypt all that was 
in the field both man and beast and the hail smote every herb of the 
field and brake every tree of the field 
only in the land of goshen where the children of israel were 
was there no hail 
and pharaoh sent and called for moses and aaron and said unto 
them i have sinned this time the lord is righteous and i and my 
people are wicked 
intreat the lord for it is enough that there be no more mighty 
thunderings and hail and i will let you go and ye shall stay no 
longer 
and moses said unto him as soon as i am gone out of the city i 
will spread abroad my hands unto the lord and the thunder shall 
cease neither shall there be any more hail that thou mayest know how 
that the earth is the lord s 
but as for thee and thy servants i know that ye will not yet 
fear the lord god 
and the flax and the barley was smitten for the barley was in 
the ear and the flax was bolled 
but the wheat and the rie were not smitten for they were not 
grown up 
and moses went out of the city from pharaoh and spread abroad 
his hands unto the lord and the thunders and hail ceased and the 
rain was not poured upon the earth 
and when pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders 
were ceased he sinned yet more and hardened his heart he and his 
servants 
and the heart of pharaoh was hardened neither would he let the 
children of israel go as the lord had spoken by moses 
and the lord said unto moses go in unto pharaoh for i have 
hardened his heart and the heart of his servants that i might shew 
these my signs before him and that thou mayest tell in the ears 
of thy son and of thy son s son what things i have wrought in egypt 
and my signs which i have done among them that ye may know how that i 
am the lord 
and moses and aaron came in unto pharaoh and said unto him thus 
saith the lord god of the hebrews how long wilt thou refuse to humble 
thyself before me let my people go that they may serve me 
else if thou refuse to let my people go behold to morrow will 
i bring the locusts into thy coast and they shall cover the face 
of the earth that one cannot be able to see the earth and they shall 
eat the residue of that which is escaped which remaineth unto you 
from the hail and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of 
the field and they shall fill thy houses and the houses of all 
thy servants and the houses of all the egyptians which neither thy 
fathers nor thy fathers fathers have seen since the day that they 
were upon the earth unto this day and he turned himself and went out 
from pharaoh 
and pharaoh s servants said unto him how long shall this man be 
a snare unto us let the men go that they may serve the lord their 
god knowest thou not yet that egypt is destroyed and moses and 
aaron were brought again unto pharaoh and he said unto them go 
serve the lord your god but who are they that shall go and 
moses said we will go with our young and with our old with our sons 
and with our daughters with our flocks and with our herds will we go 
for we must hold a feast unto the lord 
and he said unto them let the lord be so with you as i will 
let you go and your little ones look to it for evil is before you 
not so go now ye that are men and serve the lord for that ye 
did desire and they were driven out from pharaoh s presence 
and the lord said unto moses stretch out thine hand over the 
land of egypt for the locusts that they may come up upon the land of 
egypt and eat every herb of the land even all that the hail hath 
left 
and moses stretched forth his rod over the land of egypt and 
the lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day and all that 
night and when it was morning the east wind brought the locusts 
and the locust went up over all the land of egypt and rested in 
all the coasts of egypt very grievous were they before them there 
were no such locusts as they neither after them shall be such 
for they covered the face of the whole earth so that the land 
was darkened and they did eat every herb of the land and all the 
fruit of the trees which the hail had left and there remained not any 
green thing in the trees or in the herbs of the field through all 
the land of egypt 
then pharaoh called for moses and aaron in haste and he said i 
have sinned against the lord your god and against you 
now therefore forgive i pray thee my sin only this once and 
intreat the lord your god that he may take away from me this death 
only 
and he went out from pharaoh and intreated the lord 
and the lord turned a mighty strong west wind which took away 
the locusts and cast them into the red sea there remained not one 
locust in all the coasts of egypt 
but the lord hardened pharaoh s heart so that he would not let 
the children of israel go 
and the lord said unto moses stretch out thine hand toward 
heaven that there may be darkness over the land of egypt even 
darkness which may be felt 
and moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven and there was 
a thick darkness in all the land of egypt three days they saw 
not one another neither rose any from his place for three days but 
all the children of israel had light in their dwellings 
and pharaoh called unto moses and said go ye serve the lord 
only let your flocks and your herds be stayed let your little ones 
also go with you 
and moses said thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt 
offerings that we may sacrifice unto the lord our god 
our cattle also shall go with us there shall not an hoof be 
left behind for thereof must we take to serve the lord our god and 
we know not with what we must serve the lord until we come thither 
but the lord hardened pharaoh s heart and he would not let them 
go 
and pharaoh said unto him get thee from me take heed to 
thyself see my face no more for in that day thou seest my face thou 
shalt die 
and moses said thou hast spoken well i will see thy face again 
no more 
and the lord said unto moses yet will i bring one plague more 
upon pharaoh and upon egypt afterwards he will let you go hence 
when he shall let you go he shall surely thrust you out hence 
altogether 
speak now in the ears of the people and let every man borrow of 
his neighbour and every woman of her neighbour jewels of silver and 
jewels of gold 
and the lord gave the people favour in the sight of the 
egyptians 
moreover the man moses was very great in the land of egypt in the 
sight of pharaoh s servants and in the sight of the people 
and moses said thus saith the lord about midnight will i go out 
into the midst of egypt and all the firstborn in the land of 
egypt shall die from the first born of pharaoh that sitteth upon his 
throne even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the 
mill and all the firstborn of beasts 
and there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of egypt 
such as there was none like it nor shall be like it any more 
but against any of the children of israel shall not a dog move 
his tongue against man or beast that ye may know how that the lord 
doth put a difference between the egyptians and israel 
and all these thy servants shall come down unto me and bow down 
themselves unto me saying get thee out and all the people that 
follow thee and after that i will go out and he went out from 
pharaoh in a great anger 
and the lord said unto moses pharaoh shall not hearken unto you 
that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of egypt 
and moses and aaron did all these wonders before pharaoh and 
the lord hardened pharaoh s heart so that he would not let the 
children of israel go out of his land 
and the lord spake unto moses and aaron in the land of egypt 
saying this month shall be unto you the beginning of months it 
shall be the first month of the year to you 
speak ye unto all the congregation of israel saying in the 
tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb 
according to the house of their fathers a lamb for an house and 
if the household be too little for the lamb let him and his neighbour 
next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls 
every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb 
your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year ye 
shall take it out from the sheep or from the goats and ye shall 
keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month and the whole 
assembly of the congregation of israel shall kill it in the evening 
and they shall take of the blood and strike it on the two side 
posts and on the upper door post of the houses wherein they shall eat 
it 
and they shall eat the flesh in that night roast with fire and 
unleavened bread and with bitter herbs they shall eat it 
eat not of it raw nor sodden at all with water but roast with 
fire his head with his legs and with the purtenance thereof 
and ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning and 
that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire 
and thus shall ye eat it with your loins girded your shoes on 
your feet and your staff in your hand and ye shall eat it in haste 
it is the lord s passover 
for i will pass through the land of egypt this night and will 
smite all the firstborn in the land of egypt both man and beast and 
against all the gods of egypt i will execute judgment i am the lord 
and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where 
ye are and when i see the blood i will pass over you and the plague 
shall not be upon you to destroy you when i smite the land of egypt 
and this day shall be unto you for a memorial and ye shall keep 
it a feast to the lord throughout your generations ye shall keep it a 
feast by an ordinance for ever 
seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread even the first day ye 
shall put away leaven out of your houses for whosoever eateth 
leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day that soul 
shall be cut off from israel 
and in the first day there shall be an holy convocation and in 
the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you no manner 
of work shall be done in them save that which every man must eat 
that only may be done of you 
and ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread for in this 
selfsame day have i brought your armies out of the land of egypt 
therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an 
ordinance for ever 
in the first month on the fourteenth day of the month at even 
ye shall eat unleavened bread until the one and twentieth day of the 
month at even 
seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses for 
whosoever eateth that which is leavened even that soul shall be cut 
off from the congregation of israel whether he be a stranger or born 
in the land 
ye shall eat nothing leavened in all your habitations shall ye 
eat unleavened bread 
then moses called for all the elders of israel and said unto 
them draw out and take you a lamb according to your families and 
kill the passover 
and ye shall take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood 
that is in the bason and strike the lintel and the two side posts 
with the blood that is in the bason and none of you shall go out at 
the door of his house until the morning 
for the lord will pass through to smite the egyptians and when 
he seeth the blood upon the lintel and on the two side posts the 
lord will pass over the door and will not suffer the destroyer to 
come in unto your houses to smite you 
and ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to 
thy sons for ever 
and it shall come to pass when ye be come to the land which the 
lord will give you according as he hath promised that ye shall keep 
this service 
and it shall come to pass when your children shall say unto 
you what mean ye by this service that ye shall say it is the 
sacrifice of the lord s passover who passed over the houses of the 
children of israel in egypt when he smote the egyptians and 
delivered our houses and the people bowed the head and worshipped 
and the children of israel went away and did as the lord had 
commanded moses and aaron so did they 
and it came to pass that at midnight the lord smote all the 
firstborn in the land of egypt from the firstborn of pharaoh that sat 
on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the 
dungeon and all the firstborn of cattle 
and pharaoh rose up in the night he and all his servants and 
all the egyptians and there was a great cry in egypt for there was 
not a house where there was not one dead 
and he called for moses and aaron by night and said rise up 
and get you forth from among my people both ye and the children of 
israel and go serve the lord as ye have said 
also take your flocks and your herds as ye have said and be 
gone and bless me also 
and the egyptians were urgent upon the people that they might 
send them out of the land in haste for they said we be all dead men 
and the people took their dough before it was leavened their 
kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders 
and the children of israel did according to the word of moses 
and they borrowed of the egyptians jewels of silver and jewels of 
gold and raiment and the lord gave the people favour in the 
sight of the egyptians so that they lent unto them such things as 
they required and they spoiled the egyptians 
and the children of israel journeyed from rameses to succoth 
about six hundred thousand on foot that were men beside children 
and a mixed multitude went up also with them and flocks and 
herds even very much cattle 
and they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought 
forth out of egypt for it was not leavened because they were thrust 
out of egypt and could not tarry neither had they prepared for 
themselves any victual 
now the sojourning of the children of israel who dwelt in 
egypt was four hundred and thirty years 
and it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty 
years even the selfsame day it came to pass that all the hosts of 
the lord went out from the land of egypt 
it is a night to be much observed unto the lord for bringing 
them out from the land of egypt this is that night of the lord to be 
observed of all the children of israel in their generations 
and the lord said unto moses and aaron this is the ordinance of 
the passover there shall no stranger eat thereof but every 
man s servant that is bought for money when thou hast circumcised 
him then shall he eat thereof 
a foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof 
in one house shall it be eaten thou shalt not carry forth ought 
of the flesh abroad out of the house neither shall ye break a bone 
thereof 
all the congregation of israel shall keep it 
and when a stranger shall sojourn with thee and will keep the 
passover to the lord let all his males be circumcised and then let 
him come near and keep it and he shall be as one that is born in the 
land for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof 
one law shall be to him that is homeborn and unto the stranger 
that sojourneth among you 
thus did all the children of israel as the lord commanded moses 
and aaron so did they 
and it came to pass the selfsame day that the lord did bring 
the children of israel out of the land of egypt by their armies 
and the lord spake unto moses saying sanctify unto me all 
the firstborn whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of 
israel both of man and of beast it is mine 
and moses said unto the people remember this day in which ye 
came out from egypt out of the house of bondage for by strength of 
hand the lord brought you out from this place there shall no leavened 
bread be eaten 
this day came ye out in the month abib 
and it shall be when the lord shall bring thee into the land of 
the canaanites and the hittites and the amorites and the hivites 
and the jebusites which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee a 
land flowing with milk and honey that thou shalt keep this service in 
this month 
seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread and in the seventh 
day shall be a feast to the lord 
unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days and there shall no 
leavened bread be seen with thee neither shall there be leaven seen 
with thee in all thy quarters 
and thou shalt shew thy son in that day saying this is done 
because of that which the lord did unto me when i came forth out of 
egypt 
and it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand and for a 
memorial between thine eyes that the lord s law may be in thy mouth 
for with a strong hand hath the lord brought thee out of egypt 
thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year 
to year 
and it shall be when the lord shall bring thee into the land of 
the canaanites as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers and shall 
give it thee that thou shalt set apart unto the lord all that 
openeth the matrix and every firstling that cometh of a beast which 
thou hast the males shall be the lord s 
and every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb and 
if thou wilt not redeem it then thou shalt break his neck and all 
the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem 
and it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come 
saying what is this that thou shalt say unto him by strength of 
hand the lord brought us out from egypt from the house of bondage 
and it came to pass when pharaoh would hardly let us go that 
the lord slew all the firstborn in the land of egypt both the 
firstborn of man and the firstborn of beast therefore i sacrifice to 
the lord all that openeth the matrix being males but all the 
firstborn of my children i redeem 
and it shall be for a token upon thine hand and for frontlets 
between thine eyes for by strength of hand the lord brought us forth 
out of egypt 
and it came to pass when pharaoh had let the people go that 
god led them not through the way of the land of the philistines 
although that was near for god said lest peradventure the people 
repent when they see war and they return to egypt but god led 
the people about through the way of the wilderness of the red sea 
and the children of israel went up harnessed out of the land of egypt 
and moses took the bones of joseph with him for he had straitly 
sworn the children of israel saying god will surely visit you and 
ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you 
and they took their journey from succoth and encamped in etham 
in the edge of the wilderness 
and the lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud to 
lead them the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them 
light to go by day and night he took not away the pillar of 
the cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night from before the 
people 
and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto the 
children of israel that they turn and encamp before pihahiroth 
between migdol and the sea over against baalzephon before it shall 
ye encamp by the sea 
for pharaoh will say of the children of israel they are 
entangled in the land the wilderness hath shut them in 
and i will harden pharaoh s heart that he shall follow after 
them and i will be honoured upon pharaoh and upon all his host that 
the egyptians may know that i am the lord and they did so 
and it was told the king of egypt that the people fled and the 
heart of pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people 
and they said why have we done this that we have let israel go from 
serving us and he made ready his chariot and took his people 
with him and he took six hundred chosen chariots and all the 
chariots of egypt and captains over every one of them 
and the lord hardened the heart of pharaoh king of egypt and he 
pursued after the children of israel and the children of israel went 
out with an high hand 
but the egyptians pursued after them all the horses and chariots 
of pharaoh and his horsemen and his army and overtook them 
encamping by the sea beside pihahiroth before baalzephon 
and when pharaoh drew nigh the children of israel lifted up 
their eyes and behold the egyptians marched after them and they 
were sore afraid and the children of israel cried out unto the lord 
and they said unto moses because there were no graves in egypt 
hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness wherefore hast thou 
dealt thus with us to carry us forth out of egypt is not this 
the word that we did tell thee in egypt saying let us alone that we 
may serve the egyptians for it had been better for us to serve the 
egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness 
and moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and 
see the salvation of the lord which he will shew to you to day for 
the egyptians whom ye have seen to day ye shall see them again no 
more for ever 
the lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace 
and the lord said unto moses wherefore criest thou unto me 
speak unto the children of israel that they go forward but 
lift thou up thy rod and stretch out thine hand over the sea and 
divide it and the children of israel shall go on dry ground through 
the midst of the sea 
and i behold i will harden the hearts of the egyptians and 
they shall follow them and i will get me honour upon pharaoh and 
upon all his host upon his chariots and upon his horsemen 
and the egyptians shall know that i am the lord when i have 
gotten me honour upon pharaoh upon his chariots and upon his 
horsemen 
and the angel of god which went before the camp of israel 
removed and went behind them and the pillar of the cloud went from 
before their face and stood behind them and it came between 
the camp of the egyptians and the camp of israel and it was a cloud 
and darkness to them but it gave light by night to these so that the 
one came not near the other all the night 
and moses stretched out his hand over the sea and the lord 
caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night and 
made the sea dry land and the waters were divided 
and the children of israel went into the midst of the sea upon 
the dry ground and the waters were a wall unto them on their right 
hand and on their left 
and the egyptians pursued and went in after them to the midst 
of the sea even all pharaoh s horses his chariots and his horsemen 
and it came to pass that in the morning watch the lord looked 
unto the host of the egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the 
cloud and troubled the host of the egyptians and took off 
their chariot wheels that they drave them heavily so that the 
egyptians said let us flee from the face of israel for the lord 
fighteth for them against the egyptians 
and the lord said unto moses stretch out thine hand over the 
sea that the waters may come again upon the egyptians upon their 
chariots and upon their horsemen 
and moses stretched forth his hand over the sea and the sea 
returned to his strength when the morning appeared and the egyptians 
fled against it and the lord overthrew the egyptians in the midst of 
the sea 
and the waters returned and covered the chariots and the 
horsemen and all the host of pharaoh that came into the sea after 
them there remained not so much as one of them 
but the children of israel walked upon dry land in the midst of 
the sea and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and 
on their left 
thus the lord saved israel that day out of the hand of the 
egyptians and israel saw the egyptians dead upon the sea shore 
and israel saw that great work which the lord did upon the 
egyptians and the people feared the lord and believed the lord and 
his servant moses 
then sang moses and the children of israel this song unto the 
lord and spake saying i will sing unto the lord for he hath 
triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the 
sea 
the lord is my strength and song and he is become my salvation 
he is my god and i will prepare him an habitation my father s god 
and i will exalt him 
the lord is a man of war the lord is his name 
pharaoh s chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea his 
chosen captains also are drowned in the red sea 
the depths have covered them they sank into the bottom as a 
stone 
thy right hand o lord is become glorious in power thy right 
hand o lord hath dashed in pieces the enemy 
and in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown 
them that rose up against thee thou sentest forth thy wrath which 
consumed them as stubble 
and with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered 
together the floods stood upright as an heap and the depths were 
congealed in the heart of the sea 
the enemy said i will pursue i will overtake i will divide the 
spoil my lust shall be satisfied upon them i will draw my sword my 
hand shall destroy them 
thou didst blow with thy wind the sea covered them they sank 
as lead in the mighty waters 
who is like unto thee o lord among the gods who is like thee 
glorious in holiness fearful in praises doing wonders thou 
stretchedst out thy right hand the earth swallowed them 
thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast 
redeemed thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy 
habitation 
the people shall hear and be afraid sorrow shall take hold on 
the inhabitants of palestina 
then the dukes of edom shall be amazed the mighty men of moab 
trembling shall take hold upon them all the inhabitants of canaan 
shall melt away 
fear and dread shall fall upon them by the greatness of thine 
arm they shall be as still as a stone till thy people pass over o 
lord till the people pass over which thou hast purchased 
thou shalt bring them in and plant them in the mountain of 
thine inheritance in the place o lord which thou hast made for thee 
to dwell in in the sanctuary o lord which thy hands have 
established 
the lord shall reign for ever and ever 
for the horse of pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his 
horsemen into the sea and the lord brought again the waters of the 
sea upon them but the children of israel went on dry land in the 
midst of the sea 
and miriam the prophetess the sister of aaron took a timbrel 
in her hand and all the women went out after her with timbrels and 
with dances 
and miriam answered them sing ye to the lord for he hath 
triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the 
sea 
so moses brought israel from the red sea and they went out into 
the wilderness of shur and they went three days in the wilderness 
and found no water 
and when they came to marah they could not drink of the waters 
of marah for they were bitter therefore the name of it was called 
marah 
and the people murmured against moses saying what shall we 
drink and he cried unto the lord and the lord shewed him a 
tree which when he had cast into the waters the waters were made 
sweet there he made for them a statute and an ordinance and there he 
proved them and said if thou wilt diligently hearken to the 
voice of the lord thy god and wilt do that which is right in his 
sight and wilt give ear to his commandments and keep all his 
statutes i will put none of these diseases upon thee which i have 
brought upon the egyptians for i am the lord that healeth thee 
and they came to elim where were twelve wells of water and 
threescore and ten palm trees and they encamped there by the waters 
and they took their journey from elim and all the congregation 
of the children of israel came unto the wilderness of sin which is 
between elim and sinai on the fifteenth day of the second month after 
their departing out of the land of egypt 
and the whole congregation of the children of israel murmured 
against moses and aaron in the wilderness and the children of 
israel said unto them would to god we had died by the hand of the 
lord in the land of egypt when we sat by the flesh pots and when we 
did eat bread to the full for ye have brought us forth into this 
wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger 
then said the lord unto moses behold i will rain bread from 
heaven for you and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate 
every day that i may prove them whether they will walk in my law or 
no 
and it shall come to pass that on the sixth day they shall 
prepare that which they bring in and it shall be twice as much as 
they gather daily 
and moses and aaron said unto all the children of israel at 
even then ye shall know that the lord hath brought you out from the 
land of egypt and in the morning then ye shall see the glory of 
the lord for that he heareth your murmurings against the lord and 
what are we that ye murmur against us and moses said this 
shall be when the lord shall give you in the evening flesh to eat 
and in the morning bread to the full for that the lord heareth your 
murmurings which ye murmur against him and what are we your 
murmurings are not against us but against the lord 
and moses spake unto aaron say unto all the congregation of the 
children of israel come near before the lord for he hath heard your 
murmurings 
and it came to pass as aaron spake unto the whole congregation 
of the children of israel that they looked toward the wilderness 
and behold the glory of the lord appeared in the cloud 
and the lord spake unto moses saying i have heard the 
murmurings of the children of israel speak unto them saying at even 
ye shall eat flesh and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread 
and ye shall know that i am the lord your god 
and it came to pass that at even the quails came up and 
covered the camp and in the morning the dew lay round about the host 
and when the dew that lay was gone up behold upon the face of 
the wilderness there lay a small round thing as small as the hoar 
frost on the ground 
and when the children of israel saw it they said one to 
another it is manna for they wist not what it was and moses said 
unto them this is the bread which the lord hath given you to eat 
this is the thing which the lord hath commanded gather of it 
every man according to his eating an omer for every man according to 
the number of your persons take ye every man for them which are in 
his tents 
and the children of israel did so and gathered some more some 
less 
and when they did mete it with an omer he that gathered much 
had nothing over and he that gathered little had no lack they 
gathered every man according to his eating 
and moses said let no man leave of it till the morning 
notwithstanding they hearkened not unto moses but some of them 
left of it until the morning and it bred worms and stank and moses 
was wroth with them 
and they gathered it every morning every man according to his 
eating and when the sun waxed hot it melted 
and it came to pass that on the sixth day they gathered twice 
as much bread two omers for one man and all the rulers of the 
congregation came and told moses 
and he said unto them this is that which the lord hath said to 
morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the lord bake that which 
ye will bake to day and seethe that ye will seethe and that which 
remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning 
and they laid it up till the morning as moses bade and it did 
not stink neither was there any worm therein 
and moses said eat that to day for to day is a sabbath unto 
the lord to day ye shall not find it in the field 
six days ye shall gather it but on the seventh day which is 
the sabbath in it there shall be none 
and it came to pass that there went out some of the people on 
the seventh day for to gather and they found none 
and the lord said unto moses how long refuse ye to keep my 
commandments and my laws see for that the lord hath given you 
the sabbath therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two 
days abide ye every man in his place let no man go out of his place 
on the seventh day 
so the people rested on the seventh day 
and the house of israel called the name thereof manna and it 
was like coriander seed white and the taste of it was like wafers 
made with honey 
and moses said this is the thing which the lord commandeth 
fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations that they may see 
the bread wherewith i have fed you in the wilderness when i brought 
you forth from the land of egypt 
and moses said unto aaron take a pot and put an omer full of 
manna therein and lay it up before the lord to be kept for your 
generations 
as the lord commanded moses so aaron laid it up before the 
testimony to be kept 
and the children of israel did eat manna forty years until they 
came to a land inhabited they did eat manna until they came unto the 
borders of the land of canaan 
now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah 
and all the congregation of the children of israel journeyed from 
the wilderness of sin after their journeys according to the 
commandment of the lord and pitched in rephidim and there was no 
water for the people to drink 
wherefore the people did chide with moses and said give us 
water that we may drink and moses said unto them why chide ye with 
me wherefore do ye tempt the lord and the people thirsted 
there for water and the people murmured against moses and said 
wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of egypt to kill 
us and our children and our cattle with thirst and moses cried 
unto the lord saying what shall i do unto this people they be 
almost ready to stone me 
and the lord said unto moses go on before the people and take 
with thee of the elders of israel and thy rod wherewith thou smotest 
the river take in thine hand and go 
behold i will stand before thee there upon the rock in horeb 
and thou shalt smite the rock and there shall come water out of it 
that the people may drink and moses did so in the sight of the elders 
of israel 
and he called the name of the place massah and meribah because 
of the chiding of the children of israel and because they tempted the 
lord saying is the lord among us or not then came amalek 
and fought with israel in rephidim 
and moses said unto joshua choose us out men and go out fight 
with amalek to morrow i will stand on the top of the hill with the 
rod of god in mine hand 
so joshua did as moses had said to him and fought with amalek 
and moses aaron and hur went up to the top of the hill 
and it came to pass when moses held up his hand that israel 
prevailed and when he let down his hand amalek prevailed 
but moses hands were heavy and they took a stone and put it 
under him and he sat thereon and aaron and hur stayed up his hands 
the one on the one side and the other on the other side and his 
hands were steady until the going down of the sun 
and joshua discomfited amalek and his people with the edge of 
the sword 
and the lord said unto moses write this for a memorial in a 
book and rehearse it in the ears of joshua for i will utterly put 
out the remembrance of amalek from under heaven 
and moses built an altar and called the name of it 
jehovahnissi for he said because the lord hath sworn that the 
lord will have war with amalek from generation to generation 
when jethro the priest of midian moses father in law heard of 
all that god had done for moses and for israel his people and that 
the lord had brought israel out of egypt then jethro moses 
father in law took zipporah moses wife after he had sent her back 
and her two sons of which the name of the one was gershom for 
he said i have been an alien in a strange land and the name of 
the other was eliezer for the god of my father said he was mine 
help and delivered me from the sword of pharaoh and jethro 
moses father in law came with his sons and his wife unto moses into 
the wilderness where he encamped at the mount of god and he 
said unto moses i thy father in law jethro am come unto thee and thy 
wife and her two sons with her 
and moses went out to meet his father in law and did obeisance 
and kissed him and they asked each other of their welfare and they 
came into the tent 
and moses told his father in law all that the lord had done unto 
pharaoh and to the egyptians for israel s sake and all the travail 
that had come upon them by the way and how the lord delivered them 
and jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the lord had done 
to israel whom he had delivered out of the hand of the egyptians 
and jethro said blessed be the lord who hath delivered you out 
of the hand of the egyptians and out of the hand of pharaoh who hath 
delivered the people from under the hand of the egyptians 
now i know that the lord is greater than all gods for in the 
thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them 
and jethro moses father in law took a burnt offering and 
sacrifices for god and aaron came and all the elders of israel to 
eat bread with moses father in law before god 
and it came to pass on the morrow that moses sat to judge the 
people and the people stood by moses from the morning unto the 
evening 
and when moses father in law saw all that he did to the people 
he said what is this thing that thou doest to the people why sittest 
thou thyself alone and all the people stand by thee from morning unto 
even and moses said unto his father in law because the people 
come unto me to enquire of god when they have a matter they 
come unto me and i judge between one and another and i do make them 
know the statutes of god and his laws 
and moses father in law said unto him the thing that thou 
doest is not good 
thou wilt surely wear away both thou and this people that is 
with thee for this thing is too heavy for thee thou art not able to 
perform it thyself alone 
hearken now unto my voice i will give thee counsel and god 
shall be with thee be thou for the people to god ward that thou 
mayest bring the causes unto god and thou shalt teach them 
ordinances and laws and shalt shew them the way wherein they must 
walk and the work that they must do 
moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men such 
as fear god men of truth hating covetousness and place such over 
them to be rulers of thousands and rulers of hundreds rulers of 
fifties and rulers of tens and let them judge the people at 
all seasons and it shall be that every great matter they shall bring 
unto thee but every small matter they shall judge so shall it be 
easier for thyself and they shall bear the burden with thee 
if thou shalt do this thing and god command thee so then thou 
shalt be able to endure and all this people shall also go to their 
place in peace 
so moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law and did 
all that he had said 
and moses chose able men out of all israel and made them heads 
over the people rulers of thousands rulers of hundreds rulers of 
fifties and rulers of tens 
and they judged the people at all seasons the hard causes they 
brought unto moses but every small matter they judged themselves 
and moses let his father in law depart and he went his way into 
his own land 
in the third month when the children of israel were gone forth 
out of the land of egypt the same day came they into the wilderness 
of sinai 
for they were departed from rephidim and were come to the desert 
of sinai and had pitched in the wilderness and there israel camped 
before the mount 
and moses went up unto god and the lord called unto him out of 
the mountain saying thus shalt thou say to the house of jacob and 
tell the children of israel ye have seen what i did unto the 
egyptians and how i bare you on eagles wings and brought you unto 
myself 
now therefore if ye will obey my voice indeed and keep my 
covenant then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all 
people for all the earth is mine and ye shall be unto me a 
kingdom of priests and an holy nation 
these are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of 
israel 
and moses came and called for the elders of the people and laid 
before their faces all these words which the lord commanded him 
and all the people answered together and said all that the lord 
hath spoken we will do and moses returned the words of the people 
unto the lord 
and the lord said unto moses lo i come unto thee in a thick 
cloud that the people may hear when i speak with thee and believe 
thee for ever 
and moses told the words of the people unto the lord 
and the lord said unto moses go unto the people and sanctify 
them to day and to morrow and let them wash their clothes and 
be ready against the third day for the third day the lord will come 
down in the sight of all the people upon mount sinai 
and thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about saying 
take heed to yourselves that ye go not up into the mount or touch 
the border of it whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to 
death there shall not an hand touch it but he shall surely be 
stoned or shot through whether it be beast or man it shall not 
live when the trumpet soundeth long they shall come up to the mount 
and moses went down from the mount unto the people and 
sanctified the people and they washed their clothes 
and he said unto the people be ready against the third day 
come not at your wives 
and it came to pass on the third day in the morning that there 
were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud upon the mount and 
the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud so that all the people that 
was in the camp trembled 
and moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with 
god and they stood at the nether part of the mount 
and mount sinai was altogether on a smoke because the lord 
descended upon it in fire and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke 
of a furnace and the whole mount quaked greatly 
and when the voice of the trumpet sounded long and waxed louder 
and louder moses spake and god answered him by a voice 
and the lord came down upon mount sinai on the top of the 
mount and the lord called moses up to the top of the mount and moses 
went up 
and the lord said unto moses go down charge the people lest 
they break through unto the lord to gaze and many of them perish 
and let the priests also which come near to the lord sanctify 
themselves lest the lord break forth upon them 
and moses said unto the lord the people cannot come up to mount 
sinai for thou chargedst us saying set bounds about the mount and 
sanctify it 
and the lord said unto him away get thee down and thou shalt 
come up thou and aaron with thee but let not the priests and the 
people break through to come up unto the lord lest he break forth 
upon them 
so moses went down unto the people and spake unto them 
and god spake all these words saying i am the lord thy 
god which have brought thee out of the land of egypt out of the 
house of bondage 
thou shalt have no other gods before me 
thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image or any likeness 
of any thing that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath 
or that is in the water under the earth 
thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them for i 
the lord thy god am a jealous god visiting the iniquity of the 
fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them 
that hate me and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love 
me and keep my commandments 
thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain for the 
lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain 
remember the sabbath day to keep it holy 
six days shalt thou labour and do all thy work but the 
seventh day is the sabbath of the lord thy god in it thou shalt not 
do any work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter thy manservant nor 
thy maidservant nor thy cattle nor thy stranger that is within thy 
gates for in six days the lord made heaven and earth the sea 
and all that in them is and rested the seventh day wherefore the 
lord blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it 
honour thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long upon 
the land which the lord thy god giveth thee 
thou shalt not kill 
thou shalt not commit adultery 
thou shalt not steal 
thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour 
thou shalt not covet thy neighbour s house thou shalt not covet 
thy neighbour s wife nor his manservant nor his maidservant nor his 
ox nor his ass nor any thing that is thy neighbour s 
and all the people saw the thunderings and the lightnings and 
the noise of the trumpet and the mountain smoking and when the 
people saw it they removed and stood afar off 
and they said unto moses speak thou with us and we will hear 
but let not god speak with us lest we die 
and moses said unto the people fear not for god is come to 
prove you and that his fear may be before your faces that ye sin 
not 
and the people stood afar off and moses drew near unto the 
thick darkness where god was 
and the lord said unto moses thus thou shalt say unto the 
children of israel ye have seen that i have talked with you from 
heaven 
ye shall not make with me gods of silver neither shall ye make 
unto you gods of gold 
an altar of earth thou shalt make unto me and shalt sacrifice 
thereon thy burnt offerings and thy peace offerings thy sheep and 
thine oxen in all places where i record my name i will come unto 
thee and i will bless thee 
and if thou wilt make me an altar of stone thou shalt not build 
it of hewn stone for if thou lift up thy tool upon it thou hast 
polluted it 
neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar that thy 
nakedness be not discovered thereon 
now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them

thee 
by little and little i will drive them out from before thee 
until thou be increased and inherit the land 
and i will set thy bounds from the red sea even unto the sea of 
the philistines and from the desert unto the river for i will 
deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand and thou shalt 
drive them out before thee 
thou shalt make no covenant with them nor with their gods 
they shall not dwell in thy land lest they make thee sin 
against me for if thou serve their gods it will surely be a snare 
unto thee 
and he said unto moses come up unto the lord thou and aaron

the morning and builded an altar under the hill and twelve pillars 
according to the twelve tribes of israel

ye shall keep the sabbath therefore for it is holy unto you 
every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death for whosoever 
doeth any work therein that soul shall be cut off from among his 
people 
six days may work be done but in the seventh is the sabbath of 
rest holy to the lord whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day 
he shall surely be put to death 
wherefore the children of israel shall keep the sabbath to 
observe the sabbath throughout their generations for a perpetual 
covenant 
it is a sign between me and the children of israel for ever for 
in six days the lord made heaven and earth and on the seventh day he 
rested and was refreshed 
and he gave unto moses when he had made an end of communing 
with him upon mount sinai two tables of testimony tables of stone 
written with the finger of god 
and when the people saw that moses delayed to come down out of 
the mount the people gathered themselves together unto aaron and 
said unto him up make us gods which shall go before us for as for 
this moses the man that brought us up out of the land of egypt we 
wot not what is become of him 
and aaron said unto them break off the golden earrings which 
are in the ears of your wives of your sons and of your daughters 
and bring them unto me 
and all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in 
their ears and brought them unto aaron 
and he received them at their hand and fashioned it with a 
graving tool after he had made it a molten calf and they said these 
be thy gods o israel which brought thee up out of the land of egypt 
and when aaron saw it he built an altar before it and aaron 
made proclamation and said to morrow is a feast to the lord 
and they rose up early on the morrow and offered burnt 
offerings and brought peace offerings and the people sat down to eat 
and to drink and rose up to play 
and the lord said unto moses go get thee down for thy people 
which thou broughtest out of the land of egypt have corrupted 
themselves they have turned aside quickly out of the way which i 
commanded them they have made them a molten calf and have worshipped 
it and have sacrificed thereunto and said these be thy gods o 
israel which have brought thee up out of the land of egypt 
and the lord said unto moses i have seen this people and 
behold it is a stiffnecked people now therefore let me alone 
that my wrath may wax hot against them and that i may consume them 
and i will make of thee a great nation 
and moses besought the lord his god and said lord why doth 
thy wrath wax hot against thy people which thou hast brought forth 
out of the land of egypt with great power and with a mighty hand 
wherefore should the egyptians speak and say for mischief did 
he bring them out to slay them in the mountains and to consume them 
from the face of the earth turn from thy fierce wrath and repent of 
this evil against thy people 
remember abraham isaac and israel thy servants to whom thou 
swarest by thine own self and saidst unto them i will multiply your 
seed as the stars of heaven and all this land that i have spoken of 
will i give unto your seed and they shall inherit it for ever 
and the lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto 
his people 
and moses turned and went down from the mount and the two 
tables of the testimony were in his hand the tables were written on 
both their sides on the one side and on the other were they written 
and the tables were the work of god and the writing was the 
writing of god graven upon the tables 
and when joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted 
he said unto moses there is a noise of war in the camp 
and he said it is not the voice of them that shout for mastery 
neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome but the 
noise of them that sing do i hear 
and it came to pass as soon as he came nigh unto the camp that 
he saw the calf and the dancing and moses anger waxed hot and he 
cast the tables out of his hands and brake them beneath the mount 
and he took the calf which they had made and burnt it in the 
fire and ground it to powder and strawed it upon the water and made 
the children of israel drink of it 
and moses said unto aaron what did this people unto thee that 
thou hast brought so great a sin upon them and aaron said let 
not the anger of my lord wax hot thou knowest the people that they 
are set on mischief 
for they said unto me make us gods which shall go before us 
for as for this moses the man that brought us up out of the land of 
egypt we wot not what is become of him 
and i said unto them whosoever hath any gold let them break it 
off so they gave it me then i cast it into the fire and there came 
out this calf 
and when moses saw that the people were naked for aaron had 
made them naked unto their shame among their enemies then 
moses stood in the gate of the camp and said who is on the lord s 
side let him come unto me and all the sons of levi gathered 
themselves together unto him 
and he said unto them thus saith the lord god of israel put 
every man his sword by his side and go in and out from gate to gate 
throughout the camp and slay every man his brother and every man his 
companion and every man his neighbour 
and the children of levi did according to the word of moses and 
there fell of the people that day about three thousand men 
for moses had said consecrate yourselves today to the lord 
even every man upon his son and upon his brother that he may bestow 
upon you a blessing this day 
and it came to pass on the morrow that moses said unto the 
people ye have sinned a great sin and now i will go up unto the 
lord peradventure i shall make an atonement for your sin 
and moses returned unto the lord and said oh this people have 
sinned a great sin and have made them gods of gold 
yet now if thou wilt forgive their sin and if not blot me 
i pray thee out of thy book which thou hast written 
and the lord said unto moses whosoever hath sinned against me 
him will i blot out of my book 
therefore now go lead the people unto the place of which i have 
spoken unto thee behold mine angel shall go before thee 
nevertheless in the day when i visit i will visit their sin upon them 
and the lord plagued the people because they made the calf 
which aaron made 
and the lord said unto moses depart and go up hence thou and 
the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of egypt unto 
the land which i sware unto abraham to isaac and to jacob saying 
unto thy seed will i give it and i will send an angel before 
thee and i will drive out the canaanite the amorite and the 
hittite and the perizzite the hivite and the jebusite unto a 
land flowing with milk and honey for i will not go up in the midst of 
thee for thou art a stiffnecked people lest i consume thee in the 
way 
and when the people heard these evil tidings they mourned and 
no man did put on him his ornaments 
for the lord had said unto moses say unto the children of 
israel ye are a stiffnecked people i will come up into the midst of 
thee in a moment and consume thee therefore now put off thy 
ornaments from thee that i may know what to do unto thee 
and the children of israel stripped themselves of their ornaments 
by the mount horeb 
and moses took the tabernacle and pitched it without the camp 
afar off from the camp and called it the tabernacle of the 
congregation and it came to pass that every one which sought the 
lord went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation which was 
without the camp 
and it came to pass when moses went out unto the tabernacle 
that all the people rose up and stood every man at his tent door and 
looked after moses until he was gone into the tabernacle 
and it came to pass as moses entered into the tabernacle the 
cloudy pillar descended and stood at the door of the tabernacle and 
the lord talked with moses 
and all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle 
door and all the people rose up and worshipped every man in his tent 
door 
and the lord spake unto moses face to face as a man speaketh 
unto his friend and he turned again into the camp but his servant 
joshua the son of nun a young man departed not out of the 
tabernacle 
and moses said unto the lord see thou sayest unto me bring up 
this people and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with 
me yet thou hast said i know thee by name and thou hast also found 
grace in my sight 
now therefore i pray thee if i have found grace in thy sight 
shew me now thy way that i may know thee that i may find grace in 
thy sight and consider that this nation is thy people 
and he said my presence shall go with thee and i will give 
thee rest 
and he said unto him if thy presence go not with me carry us 
not up hence 
for wherein shall it be known here that i and thy people have 
found grace in thy sight is it not in that thou goest with us so 
shall we be separated i and thy people from all the people that are 
upon the face of the earth 
and the lord said unto moses i will do this thing also that 
thou hast spoken for thou hast found grace in my sight and i know 
thee by name 
and he said i beseech thee shew me thy glory 
and he said i will make all my goodness pass before thee and i 
will proclaim the name of the lord before thee and will be gracious 
to whom i will be gracious and will shew mercy on whom i will shew 
mercy 
and he said thou canst not see my face for there shall no man 
see me and live 
and the lord said behold there is a place by me and thou 
shalt stand upon a rock and it shall come to pass while my 
glory passeth by that i will put thee in a clift of the rock and 
will cover thee with my hand while i pass by and i will take 
away mine hand and thou shalt see my back parts but my face shall 
not be seen 
and the lord said unto moses hew thee two tables of stone like 
unto the first and i will write upon these tables the words that were 
in the first tables which thou brakest 
and be ready in the morning and come up in the morning unto 
mount sinai and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount 
and no man shall come up with thee neither let any man be seen 
throughout all the mount neither let the flocks nor herds feed before 
that mount 
and he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first and moses 
rose up early in the morning and went up unto mount sinai as the 
lord had commanded him and took in his hand the two tables of stone 
and the lord descended in the cloud and stood with him there 
and proclaimed the name of the lord 
and the lord passed by before him and proclaimed the lord the 
lord god merciful and gracious longsuffering and abundant in 
goodness and truth keeping mercy for thousands forgiving 
iniquity and transgression and sin and that will by no means clear 
the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children 
and upon the children s children unto the third and to the fourth 
generation 
and moses made haste and bowed his head toward the earth and 
worshipped 
and he said if now i have found grace in thy sight o lord let 
my lord i pray thee go among us for it is a stiffnecked people and 
pardon our iniquity and our sin and take us for thine inheritance 
and he said behold i make a covenant before all thy people i 
will do marvels such as have not been done in all the earth nor in 
any nation and all the people among which thou art shall see the work 
of the lord for it is a terrible thing that i will do with thee 
observe thou that which i command thee this day behold i drive 
out before thee the amorite and the canaanite and the hittite and 
the perizzite and the hivite and the jebusite 
take heed to thyself lest thou make a covenant with the 
inhabitants of the land whither thou goest lest it be for a snare in 
the midst of thee but ye shall destroy their altars break 
their images and cut down their groves for thou shalt worship 
no other god for the lord whose name is jealous is a jealous god 
lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land and 
they go a whoring after their gods and do sacrifice unto their gods 
and one call thee and thou eat of his sacrifice and thou take 
of their daughters unto thy sons and their daughters go a whoring 
after their gods and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods 
thou shalt make thee no molten gods 
the feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep seven days thou 
shalt eat unleavened bread as i commanded thee in the time of the 
month abib for in the month abib thou camest out from egypt 
all that openeth the matrix is mine and every firstling among 
thy cattle whether ox or sheep that is male 
but the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb and 
if thou redeem him not then shalt thou break his neck all the 
firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem and none shall appear before 
me empty 
six days thou shalt work but on the seventh day thou shalt 
rest in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest 
and thou shalt observe the feast of weeks of the firstfruits of 
wheat harvest and the feast of ingathering at the year s end 
thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before the 
lord god the god of israel 
for i will cast out the nations before thee and enlarge thy 
borders neither shall any man desire thy land when thou shalt go up 
to appear before the lord thy god thrice in the year 
thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven 
neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto 
the morning 
the first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto 
the house of the lord thy god thou shalt not seethe a kid in his 
mother s milk 
and the lord said unto moses write thou these words for after 
the tenor of these words i have made a covenant with thee and with 
israel 
and he was there with the lord forty days and forty nights he 
did neither eat bread nor drink water and he wrote upon the tables 
the words of the covenant the ten commandments 
and it came to pass when moses came down from mount sinai with 
the two tables of testimony in moses hand when he came down from the 
mount that moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he 
talked with him 
and when aaron and all the children of israel saw moses behold 
the skin of his face shone and they were afraid to come nigh him 
and moses called unto them and aaron and all the rulers of the 
congregation returned unto him and moses talked with them 
and afterward all the children of israel came nigh and he gave 
them in commandment all that the lord had spoken with him in mount 
sinai 
and till moses had done speaking with them he put a vail on his 
face 
but when moses went in before the lord to speak with him he 
took the vail off until he came out and he came out and spake unto 
the children of israel that which he was commanded 
and the children of israel saw the face of moses that the skin 
of moses face shone and moses put the vail upon his face again 
until he went in to speak with him 
and moses gathered all the congregation of the children of israel 
together and said unto them these are the words which the lord hath 
commanded that ye should do them 
six days shall work be done but on the seventh day there shall 
be to you an holy day a sabbath of rest to the lord whosoever doeth 
work therein shall be put to death 
ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the 
sabbath day 
and moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of 
israel saying this is the thing which the lord commanded saying 
take ye from among you an offering unto the lord whosoever is of 
a willing heart let him bring it an offering of the lord gold and 
silver and brass and blue and purple and scarlet and fine 
linen and goats hair and rams skins dyed red and badgers 
skins and shittim wood and oil for the light and spices for

thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the 
congregation finished and the children of israel did according to all

according to all that the lord commanded moses so the children 
of israel made all the work 
and moses did look upon all the work and behold they had done 
it as the lord had commanded even so had they done it and moses 
blessed them 
and the lord spake unto moses saying on the first day of 
the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the 
congregation 
and thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony and cover 
the ark with the vail 
and thou shalt bring in the table and set in order the things 
that are to be set in order upon it and thou shalt bring in the 
candlestick and light the lamps thereof 
and thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the 
ark of the testimony and put the hanging of the door to the 
tabernacle 
and thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the 
door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation 
and thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation 
and the altar and shalt put water therein 
and thou shalt set up the court round about and hang up the 
hanging at the court gate 
and thou shalt take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle 
and all that is therein and shalt hallow it and all the vessels 
thereof and it shall be holy

generations 
thus did moses according to all that the lord commanded him so 
did he 
and it came to pass in the first month in the second year on 
the first day of the month that the tabernacle was reared up 
and moses reared up the tabernacle and fastened his sockets 
and set up the boards thereof and put in the bars thereof and reared 
up his pillars 
and he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle and put the 
covering of the tent above upon it as the lord commanded moses 
and he took and put the testimony into the ark and set the 
staves on the ark and put the mercy seat above upon the ark 
and he brought the ark into the tabernacle and set up the vail of the 
covering and covered the ark of the testimony as the lord commanded

commanded moses

altar and set up the hanging of the court gate so moses finished the 
work 
then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation and the glory 
of the lord filled the tabernacle 
and moses was not able to enter into the tent of the 
congregation because the cloud abode thereon and the glory of the 
lord filled the tabernacle 
and when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle the 
children of israel went onward in all their journeys but if the 
cloud were not taken up then they journeyed not till the day that it 
was taken up 
for the cloud of the lord was upon the tabernacle by day and 
fire was on it by night in the sight of all the house of israel 
throughout all their journeys

and the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave 
offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings

offerings and the fat shall have the right shoulder for his part 
for the wave breast and the heave shoulder have i taken of the 
children of israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings 
and have given them unto aaron the priest and unto his sons by a 
statute for ever from among the children of israel 
this is the portion of the anointing of aaron and of the 
anointing of his sons out of the offerings of the lord made by fire 
in the day when he presented them to minister unto the lord in the 
priest s office which the lord commanded to be given them of the 
children of israel in the day that he anointed them by a statute for 
ever throughout their generations 
this is the law of the burnt offering of the meat offering and 
of the sin offering and of the trespass offering and of the 
consecrations and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings which 
the lord commanded moses in mount sinai in the day that he commanded 
the children of israel to offer their oblations unto the lord in the 
wilderness of sinai 
and the lord spake unto moses saying take aaron and his sons 
with him and the garments and the anointing oil and a bullock for 
the sin offering and two rams and a basket of unleavened bread 
and gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the 
tabernacle of the congregation 
and moses did as the lord commanded him and the assembly was 
gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation 
and moses said unto the congregation this is the thing which the 
lord commanded to be done 
and moses brought aaron and his sons and washed them with water 
and he put upon him the coat and girded him with the girdle and 
clothed him with the robe and put the ephod upon him and he girded 
him with the curious girdle of the ephod and bound it unto him 
therewith 
and he put the breastplate upon him also he put in the 
breastplate the urim and the thummim 
and he put the mitre upon his head also upon the mitre even upon 
his forefront did he put the golden plate the holy crown as the 
lord commanded moses 
and moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and 
all that was therein and sanctified them 
and he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times and anointed 
the altar and all his vessels both the laver and his foot to 
sanctify them 
and he poured of the anointing oil upon aaron s head and 
anointed him to sanctify him 
and moses brought aaron s sons and put coats upon them and 
girded them with girdles and put bonnets upon them as the lord 
commanded moses 
and he brought the bullock for the sin offering and aaron and 
his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin 
offering 
and he slew it and moses took the blood and put it upon the 
horns of the altar round about with his finger and purified the 
altar and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar and sanctified 
it to make reconciliation upon it 
and he took all the fat that was upon the inwards and the caul 
above the liver and the two kidneys and their fat and moses burned 
it upon the altar 
but the bullock and his hide his flesh and his dung he burnt 
with fire without the camp as the lord commanded moses 
and he brought the ram for the burnt offering and aaron and his 
sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram 
and he killed it and moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar 
round about 
and he cut the ram into pieces and moses burnt the head and the 
pieces and the fat 
and he washed the inwards and the legs in water and moses burnt 
the whole ram upon the altar it was a burnt sacrifice for a sweet 
savour and an offering made by fire unto the lord as the lord 
commanded moses 
and he brought the other ram the ram of consecration and aaron 
and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram 
and he slew it and moses took of the blood of it and put it 
upon the tip of aaron s right ear and upon the thumb of his right 
hand and upon the great toe of his right foot 
and he brought aaron s sons and moses put of the blood upon the 
tip of their right ear and upon the thumbs of their right hands and 
upon the great toes of their right feet and moses sprinkled the blood 
upon the altar round about 
and he took the fat and the rump and all the fat that was upon 
the inwards and the caul above the liver and the two kidneys and 
their fat and the right shoulder and out of the basket of 
unleavened bread that was before the lord he took one unleavened 
cake and a cake of oiled bread and one wafer and put them on the 
fat and upon the right shoulder and he put all upon aaron s 
hands and upon his sons hands and waved them for a wave offering 
before the lord 
and moses took them from off their hands and burnt them on the 
altar upon the burnt offering they were consecrations for a sweet 
savour it is an offering made by fire unto the lord 
and moses took the breast and waved it for a wave offering 
before the lord for of the ram of consecration it was moses part as 
the lord commanded moses 
and moses took of the anointing oil and of the blood which was 
upon the altar and sprinkled it upon aaron and upon his garments 
and upon his sons and upon his sons garments with him and 
sanctified aaron and his garments and his sons and his sons 
garments with him 
and moses said unto aaron and to his sons boil the flesh at the 
door of the tabernacle of the congregation and there eat it with the 
bread that is in the basket of consecrations as i commanded saying 
aaron and his sons shall eat it 
and that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye 
burn with fire 
and ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the 
congregation in seven days until the days of your consecration be at 
an end for seven days shall he consecrate you 
as he hath done this day so the lord hath commanded to do to 
make an atonement for you 
therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the 
congregation day and night seven days and keep the charge of the 
lord that ye die not for so i am commanded 
so aaron and his sons did all things which the lord commanded by 
the hand of moses 
and it came to pass on the eighth day that moses called aaron and 
his sons and the elders of israel and he said unto aaron take 
thee a young calf for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering 
without blemish and offer them before the lord 
and unto the children of israel thou shalt speak saying take ye 
a kid of the goats for a sin offering and a calf and a lamb both of 
the first year without blemish for a burnt offering also a 
bullock and a ram for peace offerings to sacrifice before the lord 
and a meat offering mingled with oil for to day the lord will appear 
unto you 
and they brought that which moses commanded before the tabernacle 
of the congregation and all the congregation drew near and stood 
before the lord 
and moses said this is the thing which the lord commanded that ye 
should do and the glory of the lord shall appear unto you 
and moses said unto aaron go unto the altar and offer thy sin 
offering and thy burnt offering and make an atonement for thyself 
and for the people and offer the offering of the people and make an 
atonement for them as the lord commanded 
aaron therefore went unto the altar and slew the calf of the sin 
offering which was for himself 
and the sons of aaron brought the blood unto him and he dipped 
his finger in the blood and put it upon the horns of the altar and 
poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar but the fat and 
the kidneys and the caul above the liver of the sin offering he 
burnt upon the altar as the lord commanded moses 
and the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp 
and he slew the burnt offering and aaron s sons presented unto 
him the blood which he sprinkled round about upon the altar 
and they presented the burnt offering unto him with the pieces 
thereof and the head and he burnt them upon the altar 
and he did wash the inwards and the legs and burnt them upon the 
burnt offering on the altar 
and he brought the people s offering and took the goat which 
was the sin offering for the people and slew it and offered it for 
sin as the first 
and he brought the burnt offering and offered it according to 
the manner 
and he brought the meat offering and took an handful thereof 
and burnt it upon the altar beside the burnt sacrifice of the 
morning 
he slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace 
offerings which was for the people and aaron s sons presented unto 
him the blood which he sprinkled upon the altar round about and 
the fat of the bullock and of the ram the rump and that which 
covereth the inwards and the kidneys and the caul above the liver 
and they put the fat upon the breasts and he burnt the fat upon 
the altar and the breasts and the right shoulder aaron waved for 
a wave offering before the lord as moses commanded 
and aaron lifted up his hand toward the people and blessed them 
and came down from offering of the sin offering and the burnt 
offering and peace offerings 
and moses and aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation 
and came out and blessed the people and the glory of the lord 
appeared unto all the people 
and there came a fire out from before the lord and consumed upon 
the altar the burnt offering and the fat which when all the people 
saw they shouted and fell on their faces 
and nadab and abihu the sons of aaron took either of them his 
censer and put fire therein and put incense thereon and offered 
strange fire before the lord which he commanded them not 
and there went out fire from the lord and devoured them and 
they died before the lord 
then moses said unto aaron this is it that the lord spake 
saying i will be sanctified in them that come nigh me and before all 
the people i will be glorified and aaron held his peace 
and moses called mishael and elzaphan the sons of uzziel the 
uncle of aaron and said unto them come near carry your brethren 
from before the sanctuary out of the camp 
so they went near and carried them in their coats out of the 
camp as moses had said 
and moses said unto aaron and unto eleazar and unto ithamar his 
sons uncover not your heads neither rend your clothes lest ye die 
and lest wrath come upon all the people but let your brethren the 
whole house of israel bewail the burning which the lord hath kindled 
and ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the 
congregation lest ye die for the anointing oil of the lord is upon 
you and they did according to the word of moses 
and the lord spake unto aaron saying do not drink wine nor 
strong drink thou nor thy sons with thee when ye go into the 
tabernacle of the congregation lest ye die it shall be a statute for 
ever throughout your generations and that ye may put difference 
between holy and unholy and between unclean and clean and that 
ye may teach the children of israel all the statutes which the lord 
hath spoken unto them by the hand of moses 
and moses spake unto aaron and unto eleazar and unto ithamar 
his sons that were left take the meat offering that remaineth of the 
offerings of the lord made by fire and eat it without leaven beside 
the altar for it is most holy and ye shall eat it in the holy 
place because it is thy due and thy sons due of the sacrifices of 
the lord made by fire for so i am commanded 
and the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean 
place thou and thy sons and thy daughters with thee for they be 
thy due and thy sons due which are given out of the sacrifices of 
peace offerings of the children of israel 
the heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the 
offerings made by fire of the fat to wave it for a wave offering 
before the lord and it shall be thine and thy sons with thee by a 
statute for ever as the lord hath commanded 
and moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering and 
behold it was burnt and he was angry with eleazar and ithamar the 
sons of aaron which were left alive saying wherefore have ye 
not eaten the sin offering in the holy place seeing it is most holy 
and god hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation to 
make atonement for them before the lord behold the blood of 
it was not brought in within the holy place ye should indeed have 
eaten it in the holy place as i commanded 
and aaron said unto moses behold this day have they offered 
their sin offering and their burnt offering before the lord and such 
things have befallen me and if i had eaten the sin offering to day 
should it have been accepted in the sight of the lord and when 
moses heard that he was content 
and the lord spake unto moses and to aaron saying unto them 
speak unto the children of israel saying these are the beasts 
which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth 
whatsoever parteth the hoof and is clovenfooted and cheweth the 
cud among the beasts that shall ye eat 
nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud or

upon all four which have legs above their feet to leap withal upon 
the earth even these of them ye may eat the locust after his 
kind and the bald locust after his kind and the beetle after his 
kind and the grasshopper after his kind 
but all other flying creeping things which have four feet

and for these ye shall be unclean whosoever toucheth the 
carcase of them shall be unclean until the even 
and whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash 
his clothes and be unclean until the even

and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto the 
children of israel saying if a woman have conceived seed and born a 
man child then she shall be unclean seven days according to the days 
of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean 
and in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be 
circumcised

and thirty days she shall touch no hallowed thing nor come into the 
sanctuary until the days of her purifying be fulfilled 
but if she bear a maid child then she shall be unclean two 
weeks as in her separation and she shall continue in the blood of 
her purifying threescore and six days 
and when the days of her purifying are fulfilled for a son or 
for a daughter she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt

and if she be not able to bring a lamb then she shall bring two 
turtles or two young pigeons the one for the burnt offering and the 
other for a sin offering and the priest shall make an atonement for 
her and she shall be clean 
and the lord spake unto moses and aaron saying when a man 
shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising a scab or bright spot 
and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy then he 
shall be brought unto aaron the priest or unto one of his sons the

and the lord spake unto moses after the death of the two sons of 
aaron when they offered before the lord and died and the lord 
said unto moses speak unto aaron thy brother that he come not at all 
times into the holy place within the vail before the mercy seat which 
is upon the ark that he die not for i will appear in the cloud upon 
the mercy seat

of israel and all their transgressions in all their sins putting

place shall one carry forth without the camp and they shall burn in 
the fire their skins and their flesh and their dung 
and he that burneth them shall wash his clothes and bathe his 
flesh in water and afterward he shall come into the camp 
and this shall be a statute for ever unto you that in the 
seventh month on the tenth day of the month ye shall afflict your 
souls and do no work at all whether it be one of your own country 
or a stranger that sojourneth among you for on that day shall 
the priest make an atonement for you to cleanse you that ye may be 
clean from all your sins before the lord 
it shall be a sabbath of rest unto you and ye shall afflict 
your souls by a statute for ever

the priests and for all the people of the congregation 
and this shall be an everlasting statute unto you to make an 
atonement for the children of israel for all their sins once a year 
and he did as the lord commanded moses 
and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto aaron and 
unto his sons and unto all the children of israel and say unto them 
this is the thing which the lord hath commanded saying what man 
soever there be of the house of israel that killeth an ox or lamb 
or goat in the camp or that killeth it out of the camp and 
bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation 
to offer an offering unto the lord before the tabernacle of the lord 
blood shall be imputed unto that man he hath she would blood and that man 
shall be cut off from among his people to the end that the 
children of israel may bring their sacrifices which they offer in the 
open field even that they may bring them unto the lord unto the door 
of the tabernacle of the congregation unto the priest and offer them 
for peace offerings unto the lord 
and the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the 
lord at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and burn the 
fat for a sweet savour unto the lord 
and they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils after 
whom they have gone a whoring this shall be a statute for ever unto 
them throughout their generations 
and thou shalt say unto them whatsoever man there be of the 
house of israel or of the strangers which sojourn among you that 
offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice and bringeth it not unto 
the door of the tabernacle of the congregation to offer it unto the 
lord even that man shall be cut off from among his people 
and whatsoever man there be of the house of israel or of the 
strangers that sojourn among you that eateth any manner of blood i 
will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood and will 
cut him off from among his people 
for the life of the flesh is in the blood and i have given it 
to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls for it is 
the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul 
therefore i said unto the children of israel no soul of you 
shall eat blood neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you 
eat blood 
and whatsoever man there be of the children of israel or of the 
strangers that sojourn among you which hunteth and catcheth any beast 
or fowl that may be eaten he shall even pour out the blood thereof 
and cover it with dust 
for it is the life of all flesh the blood of it is for the life 
thereof therefore i said unto the children of israel ye shall eat 
the blood of no manner of flesh for the life of all flesh is the 
blood thereof whosoever eateth it shall be cut off 
and every soul that eateth that which died of itself or that 
which was torn with beasts whether it be one of your own country or 
a stranger he shall both wash his clothes and bathe himself in 
water and be unclean until the even then shall he be clean 
but if he wash them not nor bathe his flesh then he shall bear 
his iniquity 
and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto the 
children of israel and say unto them i am the lord your god 
after the doings of the land of egypt wherein ye dwelt shall ye 
not do and after the doings of the land of canaan whither i bring 
you shall ye not do neither shall ye walk in their ordinances 
ye shall do my judgments and keep mine ordinances to walk 
therein i am the lord your god

seed unto molech he shall surely be put to death the people of the 
land shall stone him with stones 
and i will set my face against that man and will cut him off 
from among his people because he hath given of his seed unto molech 
to defile my sanctuary and to profane my holy name 
and if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from 
the man when he giveth of his seed unto molech and kill him not 
then i will set my face against that man and against his family

unclean and between unclean fowls and clean and ye shall not make 
your souls abominable by beast or by fowl or by any manner of living 
thing that creepeth on the ground which i have separated from you as 
unclean 
and ye shall be holy unto me for i the lord am holy and have 
severed you from other people that ye should be mine 
a man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit or that is a 
wizard shall surely be put to death they shall stone them with 
stones their blood shall be upon them 
and the lord said unto moses speak unto the priests the sons of 
aaron and say unto them there shall none be defiled for the dead 
among his people but for his kin that is near unto him that 
is for his mother and for his father and for his son and for his 
daughter and for his brother 
and for his sister a virgin that is nigh unto him which hath 
had no husband for her may he be defiled 
but he shall not defile himself being a chief man among his 
people to profane himself 
they shall not make baldness upon their head neither shall they 
shave off the corner of their beard nor make any cuttings in their 
flesh 
they shall be holy unto their god and not profane the name of 
their god for the offerings of the lord made by fire and the bread 
of their god they do offer therefore they shall be holy 
they shall not take a wife that is a whore or profane neither 
shall they take a woman put away from her husband for he is holy unto 
his god 
thou shalt sanctify him therefore for he offereth the bread of 
thy god he shall be holy unto thee for i the lord which sanctify 
you am holy 
and the daughter of any priest if she profane herself by playing 
the whore she profaneth her father she shall be burnt with fire 
and he that is the high priest among his brethren upon whose 
head the anointing oil was poured and that is consecrated to put on 
the garments shall not uncover his head nor rend his clothes 
neither shall he go in to any dead body nor defile himself for his 
father or for his mother neither shall he go out of the 
sanctuary nor profane the sanctuary of his god for the crown of the 
anointing oil of his god is upon him i am the lord 
and he shall take a wife in her virginity 
a widow or a divorced woman or profane or an harlot these 
shall he not take but he shall take a virgin of his own people to 
wife 
neither shall he profane his seed among his people for i the 
lord do sanctify him 
and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto aaron 
saying whosoever he be of thy seed in their generations that hath any 
blemish let him not approach to offer the bread of his god 
for whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish he shall not 
approach a blind man or a lame or he that hath a flat nose or any 
thing superfluous or a man that is brokenfooted or 
brokenhanded or crookbackt or a dwarf or that hath a blemish 
in his eye or be scurvy or scabbed or hath his stones broken 
no man that hath a blemish of the seed of aaron the priest shall come 
nigh to offer the offerings of the lord made by fire he hath a 
blemish he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his god 
he shall eat the bread of his god both of the most holy and of 
the holy 
only he shall not go in unto the vail nor come nigh unto the 
altar because he hath a blemish that he profane not my sanctuaries 
for i the lord do sanctify them 
and moses told it unto aaron and to his sons and unto all the 
children of israel 
and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto aaron and 
to his sons that they separate themselves from the holy things of the 
children of israel and that they profane not my holy name in those 
things which they hallow unto me i am the lord 
say unto them whosoever he be of all your seed among your 
generations that goeth unto the holy things which the children of 
israel hallow unto the lord having his uncleanness upon him that 
soul shall be cut off from my presence i am the lord 
what man soever of the seed of aaron is a leper or hath a 
running issue he shall not eat of the holy things until he be clean 
and whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the dead or a man 
whose seed goeth from him or whosoever toucheth any creeping 
thing whereby he may be made unclean or a man of whom he may take 
uncleanness whatsoever uncleanness he hath the soul which hath 
touched any such shall be unclean until even and shall not eat of the 
holy things unless he wash his flesh with water 
and when the sun is down he shall be clean and shall afterward 
eat of the holy things because it is his food 
that which dieth of itself or is torn with beasts he shall not 
eat to defile himself therewith i am the lord 
they shall therefore keep mine ordinance lest they bear sin for 
it and die therefore if they profane it i the lord do sanctify 
them 
there shall no stranger eat of the holy thing a sojourner of 
the priest or an hired servant shall not eat of the holy thing 
but if the priest buy any soul with his money he shall eat of 
it and he that is born in his house they shall eat of his meat 
if the priest s daughter also be married unto a stranger she 
may not eat of an offering of the holy things 
but if the priest s daughter be a widow or divorced and have 
no child and is returned unto her father s house as in her youth 
she shall eat of her father s meat but there shall be no stranger eat 
thereof 
and if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly then he shall 
put the fifth part thereof unto it and shall give it unto the priest 
with the holy thing 
and they shall not profane the holy things of the children of 
israel which they offer unto the lord or suffer them to bear 
the iniquity of trespass when they eat their holy things for i the 
lord do sanctify them 
and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto aaron 
and to his sons and unto all the children of israel and say unto 
them whatsoever he be of the house of israel or of the strangers in 
israel that will offer his oblation for all his vows and for all his 
freewill offerings which they will offer unto the lord for a burnt 
offering ye shall offer at your own will a male without 
blemish of the beeves of the sheep or of the goats 
but whatsoever hath a blemish that shall ye not offer for it

crushed or broken or cut neither shall ye make any offering thereof 
in your land

god of any of these because their corruption is in them and 
blemishes be in them they shall not be accepted for you 
and the lord spake unto moses saying when a bullock or 
a sheep or a goat is brought forth then it shall be seven days 
under the dam and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be 
accepted for an offering made by fire unto the lord 
and whether it be cow or ewe ye shall not kill it and her 
young both in one day

egyptian went out among the children of israel and this son of the 
israelitish woman and a man of israel strove together in the camp 
and the israelitish woman s son blasphemed the name of the lord 
and cursed and they brought him unto moses and his mother s name 
was shelomith the daughter of dibri of the tribe of dan and 
they put him in ward that the mind of the lord might be shewed them 
and the lord spake unto moses saying bring forth him 
that hath cursed without the camp and let all that heard him lay 
their hands upon his head and let all the congregation stone him 
and thou shalt speak unto the children of israel saying 
whosoever curseth his god shall bear his sin

tooth for tooth as he hath caused a blemish in a man so shall it be 
done to him again 
and he that killeth a beast he shall restore it and he that 
killeth a man he shall be put to death 
ye shall have one manner of law as well for the stranger as 
for one of your own country for i am the lord your god 
and moses spake to the children of israel that they should 
bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp and stone him with 
stones and the children of israel did as the lord commanded moses 
and the lord spake unto moses in mount sinai saying speak 
unto the children of israel and say unto them when ye come into the 
land which i give you then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the 
lord 
six years thou shalt sow thy field and six years thou shalt 
prune thy vineyard and gather in the fruit thereof but in the 
seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land a sabbath for 
the lord thou shalt neither sow thy field nor prune thy vineyard 
that which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt 
not reap neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed for it is a 
year of rest unto the land 
and the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you for thee and 
for thy servant and for thy maid and for thy hired servant and for 
thy stranger that sojourneth with thee 
and for thy cattle and for the beast that are in thy land shall 
all the increase thereof be meat 
and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven 
times seven years and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall 
be unto thee forty and nine years 
then shalt thou because the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the 
tenth day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall ye make 
the trumpet sound throughout all your land 
and ye shall hallow the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty 
throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be 
a jubile unto you and ye shall return every man unto his possession 
and ye shall return every man unto his family 
a jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you ye shall not sow 
neither reap that which groweth of itself in it nor gather the grapes 
in it of thy vine undressed 
for it is the jubile it shall be holy unto you ye shall eat 
the increase thereof out of the field 
in the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his 
possession 
and if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour or buyest ought of 
thy neighbour s hand ye shall not oppress one another 
according to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of 
thy neighbour and according unto the number of years of the fruits he 
shall sell unto thee according to the multitude of years thou 
shalt increase the price thereof and according to the fewness of 
years thou shalt diminish the price of it for according to the number 
of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee 
ye shall not therefore oppress one another but thou shalt fear 
thy god for i am the lord your god 
wherefore ye shall do my statutes and keep my judgments and do 
them and ye shall dwell in the land in safety 
and the land shall yield her fruit and ye shall eat your fill 
and dwell therein in safety 
and if ye shall say what shall we eat the seventh year behold 
we shall not sow nor gather in our increase then i will 
command my blessing upon you in the sixth year and it shall bring 
forth fruit for three years 
and ye shall sow the eighth year and eat yet of old fruit until 
the ninth year until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old 
store 
the land shall not be sold for ever for the land is mine for 
ye are strangers and sojourners with me 
and in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a 
redemption for the land 
if thy brother be waxen poor and hath sold away some of his 
possession and if any of his kin come to redeem it then shall he 
redeem that which his brother sold 
and if the man have none to redeem it and himself be able to 
redeem it then let him count the years of the sale thereof and 
restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it that he may 
return unto his possession 
but if he be not able to restore it to him then that which is 
sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the 
year of jubile and in the jubile it shall go out and he shall return 
unto his possession 
and if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city then he may 
redeem it within a whole year after it is sold within a full year may 
he redeem it 
and if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year then 
the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to 
him that bought it throughout his generations it shall not go out in 
the jubile 
but the houses of the villages which have no wall round about 
them shall be counted as the fields of the country they may be 
redeemed and they shall go out in the jubile 
notwithstanding the cities of the levites and the houses of the 
cities of their possession may the levites redeem at any time 
and if a man purchase of the levites then the house that was 
sold and the city of his possession shall go out in the year of 
jubile for the houses of the cities of the levites are their 
possession among the children of israel 
but the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold 
for it is their perpetual possession 
and if thy brother be waxen poor and fallen in decay with thee 
then thou shalt relieve him yea though he be a stranger or a 
sojourner that he may live with thee 
take thou no usury of him or increase but fear thy god that 
thy brother may live with thee 
thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury nor lend him thy 
victuals for increase 
i am the lord your god which brought you forth out of the land 
of egypt to give you the land of canaan and to be your god 
and if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor and be 
sold unto thee thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant 
but as an hired servant and as a sojourner he shall be with 
thee and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile 
and then shall he depart from thee both he and his children 
with him and shall return unto his own family and unto the 
possession of his fathers shall he return 
for they are my servants which i brought forth out of the land 
of egypt they shall not be sold as bondmen 
thou shalt not rule over him with rigour but shalt fear thy 
god 
both thy bondmen and thy bondmaids which thou shalt have 
shall be of the heathen that are round about you of them shall ye buy 
bondmen and bondmaids 
moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among 
you of them shall ye buy and of their families that are with you 
which they begat in your land and they shall be your possession 
and ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after 
you to inherit them for a possession they shall be your bondmen for 
ever but over your brethren the children of israel ye shall not rule 
one over another with rigour 
and if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee and thy brother 
that dwelleth by him wax poor and sell himself unto the stranger or 
sojourner by thee or to the stock of the stranger s family 
after that he is sold he may be redeemed again one of his brethren 
may redeem him either his uncle or his uncle s son may redeem 
him or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him 
or if he be able he may redeem himself 
and he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that 
he was sold to him unto the year of jubile and the price of his sale 
shall be according unto the number of years according to the time of 
an hired servant shall it be with him 
if there be yet many years behind according unto them he shall 
give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was 
bought for 
and if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile then 
he shall count with him and according unto his years shall he give 
him again the price of his redemption 
and as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him and the 
other shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight 
and if he be not redeemed in these years then he shall go out 
in the year of jubile both he and his children with him 
for unto me the children of israel are servants they are my 
servants whom i brought forth out of the land of egypt i am the lord 
your god 
ye shall make you no idols nor graven image neither rear you up 
a standing image neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your 
land to bow down unto it for i am the lord your god 
ye shall keep my sabbaths and reverence my sanctuary i am the 
lord 
if ye walk in my statutes and keep my commandments and do them 
then i will give you rain in due season and the land shall yield 
her increase and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit 
and your threshing shall reach unto the vintage and the vintage 
shall reach unto the sowing time and ye shall eat your bread to the 
full and dwell in your land safely 
and i will give peace in the land and ye shall lie down and 
none shall make you afraid and i will rid evil beasts out of the 
land neither shall the sword go through your land 
and ye shall chase your enemies and they shall fall before you 
by the sword 
and five of you shall chase an hundred and an hundred of you 
shall put ten thousand to flight and your enemies shall fall before 
you by the sword 
for i will have respect unto you and make you fruitful and 
multiply you and establish my covenant with you 
and ye shall eat old store and bring forth the old because of 
the new 
and i set my tabernacle among you and my soul shall not abhor 
you 
and i will walk among you and will be your god and ye shall be 
my people 
i am the lord your god which brought you forth out of the land 
of egypt that ye should not be their bondmen and i have broken the 
bands of your yoke and made you go upright 
but if ye will not hearken unto me and will not do all these 
commandments and if ye shall despise my statutes or if your 
soul abhor my judgments so that ye will not do all my commandments 
but that ye break my covenant i also will do this unto you i 
will even appoint over you terror consumption and the burning ague 
that shall consume the eyes and because sorrow of heart and ye shall 
sow your seed in vain for your enemies shall eat it 
and i will set my face against you and ye shall be slain before 
your enemies they that hate you shall reign over you and ye shall 
flee when none pursueth you 
and if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me then i will 
punish you seven times more for your sins 
and i will break the pride of your power and i will make your 
heaven as iron and your earth as brass and your strength shall 
be spent in vain for your land shall not yield her increase neither 
shall the trees of the land yield their fruits 
and if ye walk contrary unto me and will not hearken unto me i 
will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins 
i will also send wild beasts among you which shall rob you of 
your children and destroy your cattle and make you few in number 
and your high ways shall be desolate 
and if ye will not be reformed by me by these things but will 
walk contrary unto me then will i also walk contrary unto you 
and will punish you yet seven times for your sins 
and i will bring a sword upon you that shall avenge the quarrel 
of my covenant and when ye are gathered together within your cities 
i will send the pestilence among you and ye shall be delivered into 
the hand of the enemy 
and when i have broken the staff of your bread ten women shall 
bake your bread in one oven and they shall deliver you your bread 
again by weight and ye shall eat and not be satisfied 
and if ye will not for all this hearken unto me but walk 
contrary unto me then i will walk contrary unto you also in 
fury and i even i will chastise you seven times for your sins 
and ye shall eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your 
daughters shall ye eat 
and i will destroy your high places and cut down your images 
and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols and my soul 
shall abhor you 
and i will make your cities waste and bring your sanctuaries 
unto desolation and i will not smell the savour of your sweet odours 
and i will bring the land into desolation and your enemies 
which dwell therein shall be astonished at it 
and i will scatter you among the heathen and will draw out a 
sword after you and your land shall be desolate and your cities 
waste 
then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths as long as it lieth 
desolate and ye be in your enemies land even then shall the land 
rest and enjoy her sabbaths 
as long as it lieth desolate it shall rest because it did not 
rest in your sabbaths when ye dwelt upon it 
and upon them that are left alive of you i will send a faintness 
into their hearts in the lands of their enemies and the sound of a 
shaken leaf shall chase them and they shall flee as fleeing from a 
sword and they shall fall when none pursueth 
and they shall fall one upon another as it were before a sword 
when none pursueth and ye shall have no power to stand before your 
enemies 
and ye shall perish among the heathen and the land of your 
enemies shall eat you up 
and they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity 
in your enemies lands and also in the iniquities of their fathers 
shall they pine away with them 
if they shall confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their 
fathers with their trespass which they trespassed against me and 
that also they have walked contrary unto me and that i also 
have walked contrary unto them and have brought them into the land of 
their enemies if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled and they 
then accept of the punishment of their iniquity then will i 
remember my covenant with jacob and also my covenant with isaac and 
also my covenant with abraham will i remember and i will remember the 
land 
the land also shall be left of them and shall enjoy her 
sabbaths while she lieth desolate without them and they shall accept 
of the punishment of their iniquity because even because they 
despised my judgments and because their soul abhorred my statutes 
and yet for all that when they be in the land of their enemies 
i will not cast them away neither will i abhor them to destroy them 
utterly and to break my covenant with them for i am the lord their 
god 
but i will for their sakes remember the covenant of their 
ancestors whom i brought forth out of the land of egypt in the sight 
of the heathen that i might be their god i am the lord 
these are the statutes and judgments and laws which the lord 
made between him and the children of israel in mount sinai by the hand 
of moses 
and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto the 
children of israel and say unto them when a man shall make a 
singular vow the persons shall be for the lord by thy estimation 
and thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old

and every offering of all the holy things of the children of 
israel which they bring unto the priest shall be his 
and every man s hallowed things shall be his whatsoever any man 
giveth the priest it shall be his 
and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto the 
children of israel and say unto them if any man s wife go aside and 
commit a trespass against him and a man lie with her carnally 
and it be hid from the eyes of her husband and be kept close and she 
be defiled and there be no witness against her neither she be taken 
with the manner and the spirit of jealousy come upon him and he 
be jealous of his wife and she be defiled or if the spirit of 
jealousy come upon him and he be jealous of his wife and she be not 
defiled then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest and 
he shall bring her offering for her the tenth part of an ephah of 
barley meal he shall pour no oil upon it nor put frankincense 
thereon for it is an offering of jealousy an offering of memorial 
bringing iniquity to remembrance 
and the priest shall bring her near and set her before the lord 
and the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel and of 
the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take 
and put it into the water and the priest shall set the woman 
before the lord and uncover the woman s head and put the offering of 
memorial in her hands which is the jealousy offering and the priest 
shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse 
and the priest shall charge her by an oath and say unto the woman if 
no man have lain with thee and if thou hast not gone aside to 
uncleanness with another instead of thy husband be thou free from 
this bitter water that causeth the curse but if thou hast gone 
aside to another instead of thy husband and if thou be defiled and 
some man have lain with thee beside thine husband then the 
priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing and the priest 
shall say unto the woman the lord make thee a curse and an oath among 
thy people when the lord doth make thy thigh to rot and thy belly to 
swell and this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy 
bowels to make thy belly to swell and thy thigh to rot and the 
woman shall say amen amen 
and the priest shall write these curses in a book and he shall 
blot them out with the bitter water and he shall cause the woman 
to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse and the water that 
causeth the curse shall enter into her and become bitter 
then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the 
woman s hand and shall wave the offering before the lord and offer 
it upon the altar and the priest shall take an handful of the 
offering even the memorial thereof and burn it upon the altar and 
afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water 
and when he hath made her to drink the water then it shall come 
to pass that if she be defiled and have done trespass against her 
husband that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her 
and become bitter and her belly shall swell and her thigh shall rot 
and the woman shall be a curse among her people 
and if the woman be not defiled but be clean then she shall be 
free and shall conceive seed 
this is the law of jealousies when a wife goeth aside to another 
instead of her husband and is defiled or when the spirit of 
jealousy cometh upon him and he be jealous over his wife and shall 
set the woman before the lord and the priest shall execute upon her 
all this law 
then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity and this woman 
shall bear her iniquity 
and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto the children 
of israel and say unto them when either man or woman shall separate 
themselves to vow a vow of a nazarite to separate themselves unto the 
lord he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink and 
shall drink no vinegar of wine or vinegar of strong drink neither 
shall he drink any liquor of grapes nor eat moist grapes or dried 
all the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made 
of the vine tree from the kernels even to the husk 
all the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor 
come upon his head until the days be fulfilled in the which he 
separateth himself unto the lord he shall be holy and shall let the 
locks of the hair of his head grow 
all the days that he separateth himself unto the lord he shall 
come at no dead body 
he shall not make himself unclean for his father or for his 
mother for his brother or for his sister when they die because the 
consecration of his god is upon his head 
all the days of his separation he is holy unto the lord 
and if any man die very suddenly by him and he hath defiled the 
head of his consecration then he shall shave his head in the day of 
his cleansing on the seventh day shall he shave it 
and on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles or two young 
pigeons to the priest to the door of the tabernacle of the 
congregation and the priest shall offer the one for a sin 
offering and the other for a burnt offering and make an atonement 
for him for that he sinned by the dead and shall hallow his head 
that same day 
and he shall consecrate unto the lord the days of his separation 
and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering but 
the days that were before shall be lost because his separation was 
defiled 
and this is the law of the nazarite when the days of his 
separation are fulfilled he shall be brought unto the door of the 
tabernacle of the congregation and he shall offer his offering 
unto the lord one he lamb of the first year without blemish for a 
burnt offering and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for 
a sin offering and one ram without blemish for peace offerings 
and a basket of unleavened bread cakes of fine flour mingled with 
oil and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil and their meat 
offering and their drink offerings 
and the priest shall bring them before the lord and shall offer 
his sin offering and his burnt offering and he shall offer the 
ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the lord with the basket 
of unleavened bread the priest shall offer also his meat offering 
and his drink offering 
and the nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the 
door of the tabernacle of the congregation and shall take the hair of 
the head of his separation and put it in the fire which is under the 
sacrifice of the peace offerings 
and the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram and one 
unleavened cake out of the basket and one unleavened wafer and shall 
put them upon the hands of the nazarite after the hair of his 
separation is shaven and the priest shall wave them for a wave 
offering before the lord this is holy for the priest with the wave 
breast and heave shoulder and after that the nazarite may drink wine 
this is the law of the nazarite who hath vowed and of his 
offering unto the lord for his separation beside that that his hand 
shall get according to the vow which he vowed so he must do after 
the law of his separation 
and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto aaron and 
unto his sons saying on this wise ye shall bless the children of 
israel saying unto them the lord bless thee and keep thee 
the lord make his face shine upon thee and be gracious unto 
thee the lord lift up his countenance upon thee and give thee 
peace 
and they shall put my name upon the children of israel and i 
will bless them 
and it came to pass on the day that moses had fully set up the 
tabernacle and had anointed it and sanctified it and all the

the tribes and were over them that were numbered offered and 
they brought their offering before the lord six covered wagons and 
twelve oxen a wagon for two of the princes and for each one an ox 
and they brought them before the tabernacle 
and the lord spake unto moses saying take it of them that 
they may be to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation 
and thou shalt give them unto the levites to every man according to 
his service

levites

according to their service and four wagons and eight oxen he gave 
unto the sons of merari according unto their service under the hand 
of ithamar the son of aaron the priest

shoulders

and when moses was gone into the tabernacle of the congregation 
to speak with him then he heard the voice of one speaking unto him 
from off the mercy seat that was upon the ark of testimony from 
between the two cherubims and he spake unto him 
and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto aaron and 
say unto him when thou lightest the lamps the seven lamps shall give 
light over against the candlestick 
and aaron did so he lighted the lamps thereof over against the 
candlestick as the lord commanded moses 
and this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold unto the 
shaft thereof unto the flowers thereof was beaten work according 
unto the pattern which the lord had shewed moses so he made the 
candlestick 
and the lord spake unto moses saying take the levites from 
among the children of israel and cleanse them 
and thus shalt thou do unto them to cleanse them sprinkle water 
of purifying upon them and let them shave all their flesh and let 
them wash their clothes and so make themselves clean 
then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering even 
fine flour mingled with oil and another young bullock shalt thou take 
for a sin offering 
and thou shalt bring the levites before the tabernacle of the 
congregation and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the children 
of israel together and thou shalt bring the levites before the 
lord and the children of israel shall put their hands upon the 
levites and aaron shall offer the levites before the lord for an 
offering of the children of israel that they may execute the service 
of the lord 
and the levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the 
bullocks and thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering and the 
other for a burnt offering unto the lord to make an atonement for 
the levites 
and thou shalt set the levites before aaron and before his sons 
and offer them for an offering unto the lord 
thus shalt thou separate the levites from among the children of 
israel and the levites shall be mine 
and after that shall the levites go in to do the service of the 
tabernacle of the congregation and thou shalt cleanse them and offer 
them for an offering 
for they are wholly given unto me from among the children of 
israel instead of such as open every womb even instead of the 
firstborn of all the children of israel have i taken them unto me 
for all the firstborn of the children of israel are mine both 
man and beast on the day that i smote every firstborn in the land of 
egypt i sanctified them for myself 
and i have taken the levites for all the firstborn of the 
children of israel 
and i have given the levites as a gift to aaron and to his sons 
from among the children of israel to do the service of the children 
of israel in the tabernacle of the congregation and to make an 
atonement for the children of israel that there be no plague among 
the children of israel when the children of israel come nigh unto the 
sanctuary 
and moses and aaron and all the congregation of the children of 
israel did to the levites according unto all that the lord commanded 
moses concerning the levites so did the children of israel unto them 
and the levites were purified and they washed their clothes and 
aaron offered them as an offering before the lord and aaron made an 
atonement for them to cleanse them 
and after that went the levites in to do their service in the 
tabernacle of the congregation before aaron and before his sons as 
the lord had commanded moses concerning the levites so did they unto 
them 
and the lord spake unto moses saying this is it that 
belongeth unto the levites from twenty and five years old and upward 
they shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of the 
congregation and from the age of fifty years they shall cease 
waiting upon the service thereof and shall serve no more but 
shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the 
congregation to keep the charge and shall do no service thus shalt 
thou do unto the levites touching their charge 
and the lord spake unto moses in the wilderness of sinai in the 
first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of 
egypt saying let the children of israel also keep the passover 
at his appointed season 
in the fourteenth day of this month at even ye shall keep it in 
his appointed season according to all the rites of it and according 
to all the ceremonies thereof shall ye keep it 
and moses spake unto the children of israel that they should keep 
the passover 
and they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first 
month at even in the wilderness of sinai according to all that the 
lord commanded moses so did the children of israel 
and there were certain men who were defiled by the dead body of a 
man that they could not keep the passover on that day and they came 
before moses and before aaron on that day and those men said unto 
him we are defiled by the dead body of a man wherefore are we kept 
back that we may not offer an offering of the lord in his appointed 
season among the children of israel and moses said unto them 
stand still and i will hear what the lord will command concerning 
you 
and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto the 
children of israel saying if any man of you or of your posterity 
shall be unclean by reason of a dead body or be in a journey afar 
off yet he shall keep the passover unto the lord 
the fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep 
it and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs 
they shall leave none of it unto the morning nor break any bone 
of it according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep 
it 
but the man that is clean and is not in a journey and 
forbeareth to keep the passover even the same soul shall be cut off 
from among his people because he brought not the offering of the lord 
in his appointed season that man shall bear his sin 
and if a stranger shall sojourn among you and will keep the 
passover unto the lord according to the ordinance of the passover 
and according to the manner thereof so shall he do ye shall have one 
ordinance both for the stranger and for him that was born in the 
land 
and on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud 
covered the tabernacle namely the tent of the testimony and at even 
there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire until 
the morning 
so it was alway the cloud covered it by day and the appearance 
of fire by night 
and when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle then after 
that the children of israel journeyed and in the place where the 
cloud abode there the children of israel pitched their tents 
at the commandment of the lord the children of israel journeyed 
and at the commandment of the lord they pitched as long as the cloud 
abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents 
and when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days 
then the children of israel kept the charge of the lord and journeyed 
not 
and so it was when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle 
according to the commandment of the lord they abode in their tents 
and according to the commandment of the lord they journeyed 
and so it was when the cloud abode from even unto the morning 
and that the cloud was taken up in the morning then they journeyed 
whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up they 
journeyed 
or whether it were two days or a month or a year that the 
cloud tarried upon the tabernacle remaining thereon the children of 
israel abode in their tents and journeyed not but when it was taken 
up they journeyed 
at the commandment of the lord they rested in the tents and at 
the commandment of the lord they journeyed they kept the charge of 
the lord at the commandment of the lord by the hand of moses 
and the lord spake unto moses saying make thee two 
trumpets of silver of a whole piece shalt thou make them that thou 
mayest use them for the calling of the assembly and for the 
journeying of the camps 
and when they shall blow with them all the assembly shall 
assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the 
congregation 
and if they blow but with one trumpet then the princes which 
are heads of the thousands of israel shall gather themselves unto 
thee 
when ye blow an alarm then the camps that lie on the east parts 
shall go forward 
when ye blow an alarm the second time then the camps that lie on 
the south side shall take their journey they shall blow an alarm for 
their journeys 
but when the congregation is to be gathered together ye shall 
blow but ye shall not sound an alarm 
and the sons of aaron the priests shall blow with the trumpets 
and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your 
generations 
and if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that 
oppresseth you then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets and ye 
shall be remembered before the lord your god and ye shall be saved 
from your enemies 
also in the day of your gladness and in your solemn days and 
in the beginnings of your months ye shall blow with the trumpets over 
your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings 
that they may be to you for a memorial before your god i am the lord 
your god 
and it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month in 
the second year that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle 
of the testimony 
and the children of israel took their journeys out of the 
wilderness of sinai and the cloud rested in the wilderness of paran 
and they first took their journey according to the commandment 
of the lord by the hand of moses 
in the first place went the standard of the camp of the children 
of judah according to their armies and over his host was nahshon the 
son of amminadab 
and over the host of the tribe of the children of issachar was 
nethaneel the son of zuar 
and over the host of the tribe of the children of zebulun was 
eliab the son of helon 
and the tabernacle was taken down and the sons of gershon and 
the sons of merari set forward bearing the tabernacle 
and the standard of the camp of reuben set forward according to 
their armies and over his host was elizur the son of shedeur 
and over the host of the tribe of the children of simeon was 
shelumiel the son of zurishaddai 
and over the host of the tribe of the children of gad was 
eliasaph the son of deuel 
and the kohathites set forward bearing the sanctuary and the 
other did set up the tabernacle against they came 
and the standard of the camp of the children of ephraim set 
forward according to their armies and over his host was elishama the 
son of ammihud 
and over the host of the tribe of the children of manasseh was 
gamaliel the son of pedahzur 
and over the host of the tribe of the children of benjamin was 
abidan the son of gideoni 
and the standard of the camp of the children of dan set forward 
which was the rereward of all the camps throughout their hosts and 
over his host was ahiezer the son of ammishaddai 
and over the host of the tribe of the children of asher was 
pagiel the son of ocran 
and over the host of the tribe of the children of naphtali was 
ahira the son of enan 
thus were the journeyings of the children of israel according to 
their armies when they set forward 
and moses said unto hobab the son of raguel the midianite 
moses father in law we are journeying unto the place of which the 
lord said i will give it you come thou with us and we will do thee 
good for the lord hath spoken good concerning israel 
and he said unto him i will not go but i will depart to mine 
own land and to my kindred 
and he said leave us not i pray thee forasmuch as thou 
knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness and thou mayest be to 
us instead of eyes 
and it shall be if thou go with us yea it shall be that what 
goodness the lord shall do unto us the same will we do unto thee 
and they departed from the mount of the lord three days 
journey and the ark of the covenant of the lord went before them in 
the three days journey to search out a resting place for them 
and the cloud of the lord was upon them by day when they went 
out of the camp 
and it came to pass when the ark set forward that moses said 
rise up lord and let thine enemies be scattered and let them that 
hate thee flee before thee 
and when it rested he said return o lord unto the many 
thousands of israel 
and when the people complained it displeased the lord and the 
lord heard it and his anger was kindled and the fire of the lord 
burnt among them and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts 
of the camp 
and the people cried unto moses and when moses prayed unto the 
lord the fire was quenched 
and he called the name of the place taberah because the fire of 
the lord burnt among them 
and the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting and 
the children of israel also wept again and said who shall give us 
flesh to eat we remember the fish which we did eat in egypt 
freely the cucumbers and the melons and the leeks and the onions 
and the garlick but now our soul is dried away there is nothing 
at all beside this manna before our eyes 
and the manna was as coriander seed and the colour thereof as 
the colour of bdellium 
and the people went about and gathered it and ground it in 
mills or beat it in a mortar and baked it in pans and made cakes of 
it and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil 
and when the dew fell upon the camp in the night the manna fell 
upon it 
then moses heard the people weep throughout their families 
every man in the door of his tent and the anger of the lord was 
kindled greatly moses also was displeased 
and moses said unto the lord wherefore hast thou afflicted thy 
servant and wherefore have i not found favour in thy sight that thou 
layest the burden of all this people upon me have i conceived 
all this people have i begotten them that thou shouldest say unto 
me carry them in thy bosom as a nursing father beareth the sucking 
child unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers 
whence should i have flesh to give unto all this people for they weep 
unto me saying give us flesh that we may eat 
i am not able to bear all this people alone because it is too 
heavy for me 
and if thou deal thus with me kill me i pray thee out of 
hand if i have found favour in thy sight and let me not see my 
wretchedness 
and the lord said unto moses gather unto me seventy men of the 
elders of israel whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people 
and officers over them and bring them unto the tabernacle of the 
congregation that they may stand there with thee 
and i will come down and talk with thee there and i will take 
of the spirit which is upon thee and will put it upon them and they 
shall bear the burden of the people with thee that thou bear it not 
thyself alone 
and say thou unto the people sanctify yourselves against to 
morrow and ye shall eat flesh for ye have wept in the ears of the 
lord saying who shall give us flesh to eat for it was well with us 
in egypt therefore the lord will give you flesh and ye shall eat 
ye shall not eat one day nor two days nor five days neither 
ten days nor twenty days but even a whole month until it come 
out at your nostrils and it be loathsome unto you because that ye 
have despised the lord which is among you and have wept before him 
saying why came we forth out of egypt and moses said the 
people among whom i am are six hundred thousand footmen and thou 
hast said i will give them flesh that they may eat a whole month 
shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them to suffice 
them or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them 
to suffice them and the lord said unto moses is the lord s 
hand waxed short thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to 
pass unto thee or not 
and moses went out and told the people the words of the lord 
and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people and set them 
round about the tabernacle 
and the lord came down in a cloud and spake unto him and took 
of the spirit that was upon him and gave it unto the seventy elders 
and it came to pass that when the spirit rested upon them they 
prophesied and did not cease 
but there remained two of the men in the camp the name of the 
one was eldad and the name of the other medad and the spirit rested 
upon them and they were of them that were written but went not out 
unto the tabernacle and they prophesied in the camp 
and there ran a young man and told moses and said eldad and 
medad do prophesy in the camp 
and joshua the son of nun the servant of moses one of his 
young men answered and said my lord moses forbid them 
and moses said unto him enviest thou for my sake would god 
that all the lord s people were prophets and that the lord would put 
his spirit upon them and moses gat him into the camp he and 
the elders of israel 
and there went forth a wind from the lord and brought quails 
from the sea and let them fall by the camp as it were a day s 
journey on this side and as it were a day s journey on the other 
side round about the camp and as it were two cubits high upon the 
face of the earth 
and the people stood up all that day and all that night and 
all the next day and they gathered the quails he that gathered least 
gathered ten homers and they spread them all abroad for themselves 
round about the camp 
and while the flesh was yet between their teeth ere it was 
chewed the wrath of the lord was kindled against the people and the 
lord smote the people with a very great plague 
and he called the name of that place kibrothhattaavah because 
there they buried the people that lusted 
and the people journeyed from kibrothhattaavah unto hazeroth 
and abode at hazeroth 
and miriam and aaron spake against moses because of the ethiopian 
woman whom he had married for he had married an ethiopian woman 
and they said hath the lord indeed spoken only by moses hath he 
not spoken also by us and the lord heard it 
now the man moses was very meek above all the men which were 
upon the face of the earth and the lord spake suddenly unto 
moses and unto aaron and unto miriam come out ye three unto the 
tabernacle of the congregation and they three came out 
and the lord came down in the pillar of the cloud and stood in 
the door of the tabernacle and called aaron and miriam and they both 
came forth 
and he said hear now my words if there be a prophet among you 
i the lord will make myself known unto him in a vision and will speak 
unto him in a dream 
my servant moses is not so who is faithful in all mine house 
with him will i speak mouth to mouth even apparently and not in 
dark speeches and the similitude of the lord shall he behold 
wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant moses 
and the anger of the lord was kindled against them and he 
departed 
and the cloud departed from off the tabernacle and behold 
miriam became leprous white as snow and aaron looked upon miriam 
and behold she was leprous 
and aaron said unto moses alas my lord i beseech thee lay 
not the sin upon us wherein we have done foolishly and wherein we 
have sinned 
let her not be as one dead of whom the flesh is half consumed 
when he cometh out of his mother s womb 
and moses cried unto the lord saying heal her now o god i 
beseech thee 
and the lord said unto moses if her father had but spit in her 
face should she not be ashamed seven days let her be shut out from 
the camp seven days and after that let her be received in again 
and miriam was shut out from the camp seven days and the people 
journeyed not till miriam was brought in again 
and afterward the people removed from hazeroth and pitched in 
the wilderness of paran 
and the lord spake unto moses saying send thou men that 
they may search the land of canaan which i give unto the children of 
israel of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man every one 
a ruler among them 
and moses by the commandment of the lord sent them from the 
wilderness of paran all those men were heads of the children of 
israel 
and these were their names of the tribe of reuben shammua the 
son of zaccur 
of the tribe of simeon shaphat the son of hori 
of the tribe of judah caleb the son of jephunneh 
of the tribe of issachar igal the son of joseph 
of the tribe of ephraim oshea the son of nun 
of the tribe of benjamin palti the son of raphu 
of the tribe of zebulun gaddiel the son of sodi 
of the tribe of joseph namely of the tribe of manasseh gaddi 
the son of susi 
of the tribe of dan ammiel the son of gemalli 
of the tribe of asher sethur the son of michael 
of the tribe of naphtali nahbi the son of vophsi 
of the tribe of gad geuel the son of machi 
these are the names of the men which moses sent to spy out the 
land 
and moses called oshea the son of nun jehoshua 
and moses sent them to spy out the land of canaan and said unto 
them get you up this way southward and go up into the mountain 
and see the land what it is and the people that dwelleth 
therein whether they be strong or weak few or many and what 
the land is that they dwell in whether it be good or bad and what 
cities they be that they dwell in whether in tents or in strong 
holds and what the land is whether it be fat or lean whether 
there be wood therein or not and be ye of good courage and bring of 
the fruit of the land now the time was the time of the firstripe 
grapes 
so they went up and searched the land from the wilderness of 
zin unto rehob as men come to hamath 
and they ascended by the south and came unto hebron where 
ahiman sheshai and talmai the children of anak were now hebron 
was built seven years before zoan in egypt and they came unto 
the brook of eshcol and cut down from thence a branch with one 
cluster of grapes and they bare it between two upon a staff and they 
brought of the pomegranates and of the figs 
the place was called the brook eshcol because of the cluster of 
grapes which the children of israel cut down from thence 
and they returned from searching of the land after forty days 
and they went and came to moses and to aaron and to all the 
congregation of the children of israel unto the wilderness of paran 
to kadesh and brought back word unto them and unto all the 
congregation and shewed them the fruit of the land 
and they told him and said we came unto the land whither thou 
sentest us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the 
fruit of it 
nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and 
the cities are walled and very great and moreover we saw the 
children of anak there 
the amalekites dwell in the land of the south and the hittites 
and the jebusites and the amorites dwell in the mountains and the 
canaanites dwell by the sea and by the coast of jordan 
and caleb stilled the people before moses and said let us go 
up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it 
but the men that went up with him said we be not able to go up 
against the people for they are stronger than we 
and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had 
searched unto the children of israel saying the land through which 
we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants 
thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great 
stature 
and there we saw the giants the sons of anak which come of the 
giants and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers and so we were 
in their sight 
and all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried and 
the people wept that night 
and all the children of israel murmured against moses and against 
aaron and the whole congregation said unto them would god that we 
had died in the land of egypt or would god we had died in this 
wilderness and wherefore hath the lord brought us unto this 
land to fall by the sword that our wives and our children should be 
a prey were it not better for us to return into egypt and they 
said one to another let us make a captain and let us return into 
egypt 
then moses and aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly 
of the congregation of the children of israel 
and joshua the son of nun and caleb the son of jephunneh which 
were of them that searched the land rent their clothes and they 
spake unto all the company of the children of israel saying the 
land which we passed through to search it is an exceeding good land 
if the lord delight in us then he will bring us into this land 
and give it us a land which floweth with milk and honey 
only rebel not ye against the lord neither fear ye the people of 
the land for they are bread for us their defence is departed from 
them and the lord is with us fear them not 
but all the congregation bade stone them with stones and the 
glory of the lord appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation 
before all the children of israel 
and the lord said unto moses how long will this people provoke 
me and how long will it be ere they believe me for all the signs 
which i have shewed among them i will smite them with the 
pestilence and disinherit them and will make of thee a greater 
nation and mightier than they 
and moses said unto the lord then the egyptians shall hear it 
for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them 
and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land for they 
have heard that thou lord art among this people that thou lord art 
seen face to face and that thy cloud standeth over them and that 
thou goest before them by day time in a pillar of a cloud and in a 
pillar of fire by night 
now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man then the 
nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak saying 
because the lord was not able to bring this people into the land which 
he sware unto them therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness 
and now i beseech thee let the power of my lord be great 
according as thou hast spoken saying the lord is 
longsuffering and of great mercy forgiving iniquity and 
transgression and by no means clearing the guilty visiting the 
iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth 
generation 
pardon i beseech thee the iniquity of this people according 
unto the greatness of thy mercy and as thou hast forgiven this 
people from egypt even until now 
and the lord said i have pardoned according to thy word 
but as truly as i live all the earth shall be filled with the glory 
of the lord 
because all those men which have seen my glory and my miracles 
which i did in egypt and in the wilderness and have tempted me now 
these ten times and have not hearkened to my voice surely they 
shall not see the land which i sware unto their fathers neither shall 
any of them that provoked me see it but my servant caleb 
because he had another spirit with him and hath followed me fully 
him will i bring into the land whereinto he went and his seed shall 
possess it 
now the amalekites and the canaanites dwelt in the valley 
tomorrow turn you and get you into the wilderness by the way of the 
red sea 
and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron saying how 
long shall i bear with this evil congregation which murmur against 
me i have heard the murmurings of the children of israel which they 
murmur against me 
say unto them as truly as i live saith the lord as ye have 
spoken in mine ears so will i do to you your carcases shall 
fall in this wilderness and all that were numbered of you according 
to your whole number from twenty years old and upward which have 
murmured against me 
doubtless ye shall not come into the land concerning which i 
sware to make you dwell therein save caleb the son of jephunneh and 
joshua the son of nun 
but your little ones which ye said should be a prey them will 
i bring in and they shall know the land which ye have despised 
but as for you your carcases they shall fall in this 
wilderness 
and your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years 
and bear your whoredoms until your carcases be wasted in the 
wilderness 
after the number of the days in which ye searched the land even 
forty days each day for a year shall ye bear your iniquities even 
forty years and ye shall know my breach of promise 
i the lord have said i will surely do it unto all this evil 
congregation that are gathered together against me in this 
wilderness they shall be consumed and there they shall die 
and the men which moses sent to search the land who returned 
and made all the congregation to murmur against him by bringing up a 
slander upon the land even those men that did bring up the evil 
report upon the land died by the plague before the lord 
but joshua the son of nun and caleb the son of jephunneh which 
were of the men that went to search the land lived still 
and moses told these sayings unto all the children of israel 
and the people mourned greatly 
and they rose up early in the morning and gat them up into the 
top of the mountain saying lo we be here and will go up unto the 
place which the lord hath promised for we have sinned 
and moses said wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment 
of the lord but it shall not prosper 
go not up for the lord is not among you that ye be not smitten 
before your enemies 
for the amalekites and the canaanites are there before you and 
ye shall fall by the sword because ye are turned away from the lord 
therefore the lord will not be with you 
but they presumed to go up unto the hill top nevertheless the 
ark of the covenant of the lord and moses departed not out of the 
camp 
then the amalekites came down and the canaanites which dwelt in 
that hill and smote them and discomfited them even unto hormah 
and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto the 
children of israel and say unto them when ye be come into the land 
of your habitations which i give unto you and will make an 
offering by fire unto the lord a burnt offering or a sacrifice in 
performing a vow or in a freewill offering or in your solemn feasts 
to make a sweet savour unto the lord of the herd or of the flock 
then shall he that offereth his offering unto the lord bring a 
meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of 
an hin of oil 
and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt 
thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice for one lamb 
or for a ram thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth 
deals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil 
and for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an 
hin of wine for a sweet savour unto the lord 
and when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering or for a 
sacrifice in performing a vow or peace offerings unto the lord 
then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth 
deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil 
and thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine 
for an offering made by fire of a sweet savour unto the lord 
thus shall it be done for one bullock or for one ram or for a 
lamb or a kid 
according to the number that ye shall prepare so shall ye do to 
every one according to their number 
all that are born of the country shall do these things after 
this manner in offering an offering made by fire of a sweet savour 
unto the lord 
and if a stranger sojourn with you or whosoever be among you in 
your generations and will offer an offering made by fire of a sweet 
savour unto the lord as ye do so he shall do 
one ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation and 
also for the stranger that sojourneth with you an ordinance for ever 
in your generations as ye are so shall the stranger be before the 
lord 
one law and one manner shall be for you and for the stranger 
that sojourneth with you 
and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto the 
children of israel and say unto them when ye come into the land 
whither i bring you then it shall be that when ye eat of the 
bread of the land ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the lord 
ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave 
offering as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor so shall 
ye heave it 
of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the lord an heave 
offering in your generations 
and if ye have erred and not observed all these commandments 
which the lord hath spoken unto moses even all that the lord 
hath commanded you by the hand of moses from the day that the lord 
commanded moses and henceforward among your generations then 
it shall be if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge 
of the congregation that all the congregation shall offer one young 
bullock for a burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the lord with 
his meat offering and his drink offering according to the manner 
and one kid of the goats for a sin offering 
and the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation 
of the children of israel and it shall be forgiven them for it is 
ignorance and they shall bring their offering a sacrifice made by 
fire unto the lord and their sin offering before the lord for their 
ignorance and it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the 
children of israel and the stranger that sojourneth among them 
seeing all the people were in ignorance 
and if any soul sin through ignorance then he shall bring a she 
goat of the first year for a sin offering 
and the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth 
ignorantly when he sinneth by ignorance before the lord to make an 
atonement for him and it shall be forgiven him 
ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance 
both for him that is born among the children of israel and for the 
stranger that sojourneth among them 
but the soul that doeth ought presumptuously whether he be born 
in the land or a stranger the same reproacheth the lord and that 
soul shall be cut off from among his people 
because he hath despised the word of the lord and hath broken 
his commandment that soul shall utterly be cut off his iniquity 
shall be upon him 
and while the children of israel were in the wilderness they 
found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day 
and they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto moses 
and aaron and unto all the congregation 
and they put him in ward because it was not declared what 
should be done to him 
and the lord said unto moses the man shall be surely put to 
death all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the 
camp 
and all the congregation brought him without the camp and 
stoned him with stones and he died as the lord commanded moses 
and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto the 
children of israel and bid them that they make them fringes in the 
borders of their garments throughout their generations and that they 
put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue and it 
shall be unto you for a fringe that ye may look upon it and remember 
all the commandments of the lord and do them and that ye seek not 
after your own heart and your own eyes after which ye use to go a 
whoring that ye may remember and do all my commandments and 
be holy unto your god 
i am the lord your god which brought you out of the land of 
egypt to be your god i am the lord your god 
now korah the son of izhar the son of kohath the son of levi 
and dathan and abiram the sons of eliab and on the son of peleth 
sons of reuben took men and they rose up before moses with 
certain of the children of israel two hundred and fifty princes of 
the assembly famous in the congregation men of renown and they 
gathered themselves together against moses and against aaron and said 
unto them ye take too much upon you seeing all the congregation are 
holy every one of them and the lord is among them wherefore then 
lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the lord and 
when moses heard it he fell upon his face and he spake unto 
korah and unto all his company saying even to morrow the lord will 
shew who are his and who is holy and will cause him to come near 
unto him even him whom he hath chosen will he because to come near unto 
him 
this do take you censers korah and all his company and 
put fire therein and put incense in them before the lord to morrow 
and it shall be that the man whom the lord doth choose he shall be 
holy ye take too much upon you ye sons of levi 
and moses said unto korah hear i pray you ye sons of levi 
seemeth it but a small thing unto you that the god of israel 
hath separated you from the congregation of israel to bring you near 
to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the lord and to 
stand before the congregation to minister unto them and he 
hath brought thee near to him and all thy brethren the sons of levi 
with thee and seek ye the priesthood also for which because 
both thou and all thy company are gathered together against the lord 
and what is aaron that ye murmur against him and moses sent 
to call dathan and abiram the sons of eliab which said we will not 
come up is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of 
a land that floweth with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness 
except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us moreover 
thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey 
or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards wilt thou put out the 
eyes of these men we will not come up 
and moses was very wroth and said unto the lord respect not 
thou their offering i have not taken one ass from them neither have 
i hurt one of them 
and moses said unto korah be thou and all thy company before 
the lord thou and they and aaron to morrow and take every 
man his censer and put incense in them and bring ye before the lord 
every man his censer two hundred and fifty censers thou also and 
aaron each of you his censer 
and they took every man his censer and put fire in them and 
laid incense thereon and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the 
congregation with moses and aaron 
and korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the 
door of the tabernacle of the congregation and the glory of the lord 
appeared unto all the congregation 
and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron saying 
separate yourselves from among this congregation that i may consume 
them in a moment 
and they fell upon their faces and said o god the god of the 
spirits of all flesh shall one man sin and wilt thou be wroth with 
all the congregation and the lord spake unto moses saying 
speak unto the congregation saying get you up from about the 
tabernacle of korah dathan and abiram 
and moses rose up and went unto dathan and abiram and the 
elders of israel followed him 
and he spake unto the congregation saying depart i pray you 
from the tents of these wicked men and touch nothing of their s lest 
ye be consumed in all their sins 
so they gat up from the tabernacle of korah dathan and abiram 
on every side and dathan and abiram came out and stood in the door 
of their tents and their wives and their sons and their little 
children 
and moses said hereby ye shall know that the lord hath sent me 
to do all these works for i have not done them of mine own mind 
if these men die the common death of all men or if they be 
visited after the visitation of all men then the lord hath not sent 
me 
but if the lord make a new thing and the earth open her mouth 
and swallow them up with all that appertain unto them and they go 
down quick into the pit then ye shall understand that these men have 
provoked the lord 
and it came to pass as he had made an end of speaking all these 
words that the ground clave asunder that was under them and 
the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up and their houses 
and all the men that appertained unto korah and all their goods 
they and all that appertained to them went down alive into the 
pit and the earth closed upon them and they perished from among the 
congregation 
and all israel that were round about them fled at the cry of 
them for they said lest the earth swallow us up also 
and there came out a fire from the lord and consumed the two 
hundred and fifty men that offered incense 
and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto eleazar 
the son of aaron the priest that he take up the censers out of the 
burning and scatter thou the fire yonder for they are hallowed 
the censers of these sinners against their own souls let them 
make them broad plates for a covering of the altar for they offered 
them before the lord therefore they are hallowed and they shall be a 
sign unto the children of israel 
and eleazar the priest took the brasen censers wherewith they 
that were burnt had offered and they were made broad plates for a 
covering of the altar to be a memorial unto the children of 
israel that no stranger which is not of the seed of aaron come near 
to offer incense before the lord that he be not as korah and as his 
company as the lord said to him by the hand of moses 
but on the morrow all the congregation of the children of israel 
murmured against moses and against aaron saying ye have killed the 
people of the lord 
and it came to pass when the congregation was gathered against 
moses and against aaron that they looked toward the tabernacle of the 
congregation and behold the cloud covered it and the glory of the 
lord appeared 
and moses and aaron came before the tabernacle of the 
congregation 
and the lord spake unto moses saying get you up from 
among this congregation that i may consume them as in a moment and 
they fell upon their faces 
and moses said unto aaron take a censer and put fire therein 
from off the altar and put on incense and go quickly unto the 
congregation and make an atonement for them for there is wrath gone 
out from the lord the plague is begun 
and aaron took as moses commanded and ran into the midst of the 
congregation and behold the plague was begun among the people and 
he put on incense and made an atonement for the people 
and he stood between the dead and the living and the plague was 
stayed 
now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and 
seven hundred beside them that died about the matter of korah 
and aaron returned unto moses unto the door of the tabernacle of 
the congregation and the plague was stayed 
and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto the 
children of israel and take of every one of them a rod according to 
the house of their fathers of all their princes according to the 
house of their fathers twelve rods write thou every man s name upon 
his rod 
and thou shalt write aaron s name upon the rod of levi for one 
rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers 
and thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation 
before the testimony where i will meet with you 
and it shall come to pass that the man s rod whom i shall 
choose shall blossom and i will make to cease from me the murmurings 
of the children of israel whereby they murmur against you 
and moses spake unto the children of israel and every one of 
their princes gave him a rod apiece for each prince one according to 
their fathers houses even twelve rods and the rod of aaron was 
among their rods 
and moses laid up the rods before the lord in the tabernacle of 
witness 
and it came to pass that on the morrow moses went into the 
tabernacle of witness and behold the rod of aaron for the house of 
levi was budded and brought forth buds and bloomed blossoms and 
yielded almonds 
and moses brought out all the rods from before the lord unto all 
the children of israel and they looked and took every man his rod 
and the lord said unto moses bring aaron s rod again before the 
testimony to be kept for a token against the rebels and thou shalt 
quite take away their murmurings from me that they die not 
and moses did so as the lord commanded him so did he 
and the children of israel spake unto moses saying behold we 
die we perish we all perish 
whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the lord 
shall die shall we be consumed with dying and the lord said 
unto aaron thou and thy sons and thy father s house with thee shall 
bear the iniquity of the sanctuary and thou and thy sons with thee 
shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood 
and thy brethren also of the tribe of levi the tribe of thy 
father bring thou with thee that they may be joined unto thee and 
minister unto thee but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister 
before the tabernacle of witness 
and they shall keep thy charge and the charge of all the 
tabernacle only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary 
and the altar that neither they nor ye also die 
and they shall be joined unto thee and keep the charge of the 
tabernacle of the congregation for all the service of the tabernacle 
and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you 
and ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary and the charge of 
the altar that there be no wrath any more upon the children of 
israel 
and i behold i have taken your brethren the levites from among 
the children of israel to you they are given as a gift for the lord 
to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation 
therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest s 
office for everything of the altar and within the vail and ye shall 
serve i have given your priest s office unto you as a service of 
gift and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death 
and the lord spake unto aaron behold i also have given thee the 
charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the 
children of israel unto thee have i given them by reason of the 
anointing and to thy sons by an ordinance for ever 
this shall be thine of the most holy things reserved from the 
fire every oblation of theirs every meat offering of theirs and 
every sin offering of theirs and every trespass offering of theirs 
which they shall render unto me shall be most holy for thee and for 
thy sons 
in the most holy place shalt thou eat it every male shall eat 
it it shall be holy unto thee 
and this is thine the heave offering of their gift with all 
the wave offerings of the children of israel i have given them unto 
thee and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee by a statute for 
ever every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it 
all the best of the oil and all the best of the wine and of 
the wheat the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the 
lord them have i given thee 
and whatsoever is first ripe in the land which they shall bring 
unto the lord shall be thine every one that is clean in thine house 
shall eat of it 
every thing devoted in israel shall be thine 
every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh which they 
bring unto the lord whether it be of men or beasts shall be thine 
nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem and the 
firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem 
and those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou 
redeem according to thine estimation for the money of five shekels 
after the shekel of the sanctuary which is twenty gerahs 
but the firstling of a cow or the firstling of a sheep or the 
firstling of a goat thou shalt not redeem they are holy thou shalt 
sprinkle their blood upon the altar and shalt burn their fat for an 
offering made by fire for a sweet savour unto the lord 
and the flesh of them shall be thine as the wave breast and as 
the right shoulder are thine 
all the heave offerings of the holy things which the children 
of israel offer unto the lord have i given thee and thy sons and thy 
daughters with thee by a statute for ever it is a covenant of salt 
for ever before the lord unto thee and to thy seed with thee 
and the lord spake unto aaron thou shalt have no inheritance in 
their land neither shalt thou have any part among them i am thy part 
and thine inheritance among the children of israel 
and behold i have given the children of levi all the tenth in 
israel for an inheritance for their service which they serve even 
the service of the tabernacle of the congregation 
neither must the children of israel henceforth come nigh the 
tabernacle of the congregation lest they bear sin and die 
but the levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the 
congregation and they shall bear their iniquity it shall be a 
statute for ever throughout your generations that among the children 
of israel they have no inheritance 
but the tithes of the children of israel which they offer as an 
heave offering unto the lord i have given to the levites to inherit 
therefore i have said unto them among the children of israel they 
shall have no inheritance 
and the lord spake unto moses saying thus speak unto the 
levites and say unto them when ye take of the children of israel the 
tithes which i have given you from them for your inheritance then ye 
shall offer up an heave offering of it for the lord even a tenth part 
of the tithe 
and this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you as 
though it were the corn of the threshingfloor and as the fulness of 
the winepress 
thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the lord of all 
your tithes which ye receive of the children of israel and ye shall 
give thereof the lord s heave offering to aaron the priest 
out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the 
lord of all the best thereof even the hallowed part thereof out of 
it 
therefore thou shalt say unto them when ye have heaved the best 
thereof from it then it shall be counted unto the levites as the 
increase of the threshingfloor and as the increase of the winepress 
and ye shall eat it in every place ye and your households for 
it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the 
congregation 
and ye shall bear no sin by reason of it when ye have heaved 
from it the best of it neither shall ye pollute the holy things of 
the children of israel lest ye die 
and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron saying this 
is the ordinance of the law which the lord hath commanded saying 
speak unto the children of israel that they bring thee a red heifer 
without spot wherein is no blemish and upon which never came yoke 
and ye shall give her unto eleazar the priest that he may bring 
her forth without the camp and one shall slay her before his face 
and eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger 
and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the 
congregation seven times and one shall burn the heifer in his 
sight her skin and her flesh and her blood with her dung shall he 
burn and the priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and 
scarlet and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer 
then the priest shall wash his clothes and he shall bathe his 
flesh in water and afterward he shall come into the camp and the 
priest shall be unclean until the even 
and he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water and 
bathe his flesh in water and shall be unclean until the even 
and a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer 
and lay them up without the camp in a clean place and it shall be 
kept for the congregation of the children of israel for a water of 
separation it is a purification for sin 
and he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his 
clothes and be unclean until the even and it shall be unto the 
children of israel and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them 
for a statute for ever 
he that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven 
days 
he shall purify himself with it on the third day and on the 
seventh day he shall be clean but if he purify not himself the third 
day then the seventh day he shall not be clean 
whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead and 
purifieth not himself defileth the tabernacle of the lord and that 
soul shall be cut off from israel because the water of separation was 
not sprinkled upon him he shall be unclean his uncleanness is yet 
upon him 
this is the law when a man dieth in a tent all that come into 
the tent and all that is in the tent shall be unclean seven days 
and every open vessel which hath no covering bound upon it is 
unclean 
and whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the 
open fields or a dead body or a bone of a man or a grave shall be 
unclean seven days 
and for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the 
burnt heifer of purification for sin and running water shall be put 
thereto in a vessel and a clean person shall take hyssop and 
dip it in the water and sprinkle it upon the tent and upon all the 
vessels and upon the persons that were there and upon him that 
touched a bone or one slain or one dead or a grave and the 
clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day and on 
the seventh day and on the seventh day he shall purify himself and 
wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and shall be clean at 
even 
but the man that shall be unclean and shall not purify himself 
that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation because he 
hath defiled the sanctuary of the lord the water of separation hath 
not been sprinkled upon him he is unclean 
and it shall be a perpetual statute unto them that he that 
sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes and he that 
toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even 
and whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean and 
the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even 
then came the children of israel even the whole congregation 
into the desert of zin in the first month and the people abode in 
kadesh and miriam died there and was buried there 
and there was no water for the congregation and they gathered 
themselves together against moses and against aaron 
and the people chode with moses and spake saying would god 
that we had died when our brethren died before the lord and why 
have ye brought up the congregation of the lord into this wilderness 
that we and our cattle should die there and wherefore have ye 
made us to come up out of egypt to bring us in unto this evil place 
it is no place of seed or of figs or of vines or of pomegranates 
neither is there any water to drink 
and moses and aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto 
the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and they fell upon 
their faces and the glory of the lord appeared unto them 
and the lord spake unto moses saying take the rod and 
gather thou the assembly together thou and aaron thy brother and 
speak ye unto the rock before their eyes and it shall give forth his 
water and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock so 
thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink 
and moses took the rod from before the lord as he commanded him 
and moses and aaron gathered the congregation together before 
the rock and he said unto them hear now ye rebels must we fetch 
you water out of this rock and moses lifted up his hand and 
with his rod he smote the rock twice and the water came out 
abundantly and the congregation drank and their beasts also 
and the lord spake unto moses and aaron because ye believed me 
not to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of israel therefore 
ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which i have given 
them 
this is the water of meribah because the children of israel 
strove with the lord and he was sanctified in them 
and moses sent messengers from kadesh unto the king of edom 
thus saith thy brother israel thou knowest all the travail that hath 
befallen us how our fathers went down into egypt and we have 
dwelt in egypt a long time and the egyptians vexed us and our 
fathers and when we cried unto the lord he heard our voice 
and sent an angel and hath brought us forth out of egypt and 
behold we are in kadesh a city in the uttermost of thy border 
let us pass i pray thee through thy country we will not pass 
through the fields or through the vineyards neither will we drink of 
the water of the wells we will go by the king s high way we will not 
turn to the right hand nor to the left until we have passed thy 
borders 
and edom said unto him thou shalt not pass by me lest i come 
out against thee with the sword 
and the children of israel said unto him we will go by the high 
way and if i and my cattle drink of thy water then i will pay for 
it i will only without doing anything else go through on my feet 
and he said thou shalt not go through and edom came out 
against him with much people and with a strong hand 
thus edom refused to give israel passage through his border 
wherefore israel turned away from him 
and the children of israel even the whole congregation 
journeyed from kadesh and came unto mount hor 
and the lord spake unto moses and aaron in mount hor by the 
coast of the land of edom saying aaron shall be gathered unto 
his people for he shall not enter into the land which i have given 
unto the children of israel because ye rebelled against my word at 
the water of meribah 
take aaron and eleazar his son and bring them up unto mount 
hor and strip aaron of his garments and put them upon eleazar 
his son and aaron shall be gathered unto his people and shall die 
there 
and moses did as the lord commanded and they went up into mount 
hor in the sight of all the congregation 
and moses stripped aaron of his garments and put them upon 
eleazar his son and aaron died there in the top of the mount and 
moses and eleazar came down from the mount 
and when all the congregation saw that aaron was dead they 
mourned for aaron thirty days even all the house of israel 
and when king arad the canaanite which dwelt in the south heard 
tell that israel came by the way of the spies then he fought against 
israel and took some of them prisoners 
and israel vowed a vow unto the lord and said if thou wilt 
indeed deliver this people into my hand then i will utterly destroy 
their cities 
and the lord hearkened to the voice of israel and delivered up 
the canaanites and they utterly destroyed them and their cities and 
he called the name of the place hormah 
and they journeyed from mount hor by the way of the red sea to 
compass the land of edom and the soul of the people was much 
discouraged because of the way 
and the people spake against god and against moses wherefore 
have ye brought us up out of egypt to die in the wilderness for there 
is no bread neither is there any water and our soul loatheth this 
light bread 
and the lord sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit 
the people and much people of israel died 
therefore the people came to moses and said we have sinned for 
we have spoken against the lord and against thee pray unto the lord 
that he take away the serpents from us and moses prayed for the 
people 
and the lord said unto moses make thee a fiery serpent and set 
it upon a pole and it shall come to pass that every one that is 
bitten when he looketh upon it shall live 
and moses made a serpent of brass and put it upon a pole and it 
came to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man when he beheld the 
serpent of brass he lived 
and the children of israel set forward and pitched in oboth 
and they journeyed from oboth and pitched at ijeabarim in the 
wilderness which is before moab toward the sunrising 
from thence they removed and pitched in the valley of zared 
from thence they removed and pitched on the other side of 
arnon which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the 
amorites for arnon is the border of moab between moab and the 
amorites 
wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the lord what 
he did in the red sea and in the brooks of arnon and at the 
stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of ar and lieth 
upon the border of moab 
and from thence they went to beer that is the well whereof the 
lord spake unto moses gather the people together and i will give 
them water 
then israel sang this song spring up o well sing ye unto it 
the princes digged the well the nobles of the people digged it 
by the direction of the lawgiver with their staves and from the 
wilderness they went to mattanah and from mattanah to nahaliel 
and from nahaliel to bamoth and from bamoth in the valley that 
is in the country of moab to the top of pisgah which looketh toward 
jeshimon 
and israel sent messengers unto sihon king of the amorites 
saying let me pass through thy land we will not turn into the 
fields or into the vineyards we will not drink of the waters of the 
well but we will go along by the king s high way until we be past 
thy borders 
and sihon would not suffer israel to pass through his border 
but sihon gathered all his people together and went out against 
israel into the wilderness and he came to jahaz and fought against 
israel 
and israel smote him with the edge of the sword and possessed 
his land from arnon unto jabbok even unto the children of ammon for 
the border of the children of ammon was strong 
and israel took all these cities and israel dwelt in all the 
cities of the amorites in heshbon and in all the villages thereof 
for heshbon was the city of sihon the king of the amorites who 
had fought against the former king of moab and taken all his land out 
of his hand even unto arnon 
wherefore they that speak in proverbs say come into heshbon 
let the city of sihon be built and prepared for there is a fire 
gone out of heshbon a flame from the city of sihon it hath consumed 
ar of moab and the lords of the high places of arnon 
woe to thee moab thou art undone o people of chemosh he hath 
given his sons that escaped and his daughters into captivity unto 
sihon king of the amorites 
we have shot at them heshbon is perished even unto dibon and 
we have laid them waste even unto nophah which reacheth unto medeba 
thus israel dwelt in the land of the amorites 
and moses sent to spy out jaazer and they took the villages 
thereof and drove out the amorites that were there 
and they turned and went up by the way of bashan and og the 
king of bashan went out against them he and all his people to the 
battle at edrei 
and the lord said unto moses fear him not for i have delivered 
him into thy hand and all his people and his land and thou shalt do 
to him as thou didst unto sihon king of the amorites which dwelt at 
heshbon 
so they smote him and his sons and all his people until there 
was none left him alive and they possessed his land 
and the children of israel set forward and pitched in the plains 
of moab on this side jordan by jericho 
and balak the son of zippor saw all that israel had done to the 
amorites 
and moab was sore afraid of the people because they were many 
and moab was distressed because of the children of israel 
and moab said unto the elders of midian now shall this company 
lick up all that are round about us as the ox licketh up the grass of 
the field 
and balak the son of zippor was king of the moabites at that time 
he sent messengers therefore unto balaam the son of beor to 
pethor which is by the river of the land of the children of his 
people to call him saying behold there is a people come out from 
egypt behold they cover the face of the earth and they abide over 
against me come now therefore i pray thee curse me this 
people for they are too mighty for me peradventure i shall prevail 
that we may smite them and that i may drive them out of the land for 
i wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed and he whom thou cursest 
is cursed 
and the elders of moab and the elders of midian departed with the 
rewards of divination in their hand and they came unto balaam and 
spake unto him the words of balak 
and he said unto them lodge here this night and i will bring 
you word again as the lord shall speak unto me and the princes of 
moab abode with balaam 
and god came unto balaam and said what men are these with thee 
and balaam said unto god balak the son of zippor king of moab 
hath sent unto me saying behold there is a people come out of 
egypt which covereth the face of the earth come now curse me them 
peradventure i shall be able to overcome them and drive them out 
and god said unto balaam thou shalt not go with them thou 
shalt not curse the people for they are blessed 
and balaam rose up in the morning and said unto the princes of 
balak get you into your land for the lord refuseth to give me leave 
to go with you 
and the princes of moab rose up and they went unto balak and 
said balaam refuseth to come with us 
and balak sent yet again princes more and more honourable than 
they 
and they came to balaam and said to him thus saith balak the 
son of zippor let nothing i pray thee hinder thee from coming unto 
me for i will promote thee unto very great honour and i will 
do whatsoever thou sayest unto me come therefore i pray thee curse 
me this people 
and balaam answered and said unto the servants of balak if 
balak would give me his house full of silver and gold i cannot go 
beyond the word of the lord my god to do less or more 
now therefore i pray you tarry ye also here this night that i 
may know what the lord will say unto me more 
and god came unto balaam at night and said unto him if the men 
come to call thee rise up and go with them but yet the word which i 
shall say unto thee that shalt thou do 
and balaam rose up in the morning and saddled his ass and went 
with the princes of moab 
and god s anger was kindled because he went and the angel of 
the lord stood in the way for an adversary against him now he was 
riding upon his ass and his two servants were with him 
and the ass saw the angel of the lord standing in the way and 
his sword drawn in his hand and the ass turned aside out of the way 
and went into the field and balaam smote the ass to turn her into 
the way 
but the angel of the lord stood in a path of the vineyards a 
wall being on this side and a wall on that side 
and when the ass saw the angel of the lord she thrust herself 
unto the wall and crushed balaam s foot against the wall and he 
smote her again 
and the angel of the lord went further and stood in a narrow 
place where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the 
left 
and when the ass saw the angel of the lord she fell down under 
balaam and balaam s anger was kindled and he smote the ass with a 
staff 
and the lord opened the mouth of the ass and she said unto 
balaam what have i done unto thee that thou hast smitten me these 
three times and balaam said unto the ass because thou hast 
mocked me i would there were a sword in mine hand for now would i 
kill thee 
and the ass said unto balaam am not i thine ass upon which 
thou hast ridden ever since i was thine unto this day was i ever will not 
to do so unto thee and he said nay 
then the lord opened the eyes of balaam and he saw the angel of 
the lord standing in the way and his sword drawn in his hand and he 
bowed down his head and fell flat on his face 
and the angel of the lord said unto him wherefore hast thou 
smitten thine ass these three times behold i went out to withstand 
thee because thy way is perverse before me and the ass saw me 
and turned from me these three times unless she had turned from me 
surely now also i had slain thee and saved her alive 
and balaam said unto the angel of the lord i have sinned for i 
knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me now therefore if 
it displease thee i will get me back again 
and the angel of the lord said unto balaam go with the men but 
only the word that i shall speak unto thee that thou shalt speak so 
balaam went with the princes of balak 
and when balak heard that balaam was come he went out to meet 
him unto a city of moab which is in the border of arnon which is in 
the utmost coast 
and balak said unto balaam did i not earnestly send unto thee 
to call thee wherefore camest thou not unto me am i not able indeed 
to promote thee to honour and balaam said unto balak lo i am 
come unto thee have i now any power at all to say any thing the word 
that god putteth in my mouth that shall i speak 
and balaam went with balak and they came unto kirjathhuzoth 
and balak offered oxen and sheep and sent to balaam and to the 
princes that were with him 
and it came to pass on the morrow that balak took balaam and 
brought him up into the high places of baal that thence he might see 
the utmost part of the people 
and balaam said unto balak build me here seven altars and 
prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams 
and balak did as balaam had spoken and balak and balaam offered 
on every altar a bullock and a ram 
and balaam said unto balak stand by thy burnt offering and i 
will go peradventure the lord will come to meet me and whatsoever he 
sheweth me i will tell thee and he went to an high place 
and god met balaam and he said unto him i have prepared seven 
altars and i have offered upon every altar a bullock and a ram 
and the lord put a word in balaam s mouth and said return unto 
balak and thus thou shalt speak 
and he returned unto him and lo he stood by his burnt 
sacrifice he and all the princes of moab 
and he took up his parable and said balak the king of moab hath 
brought me from aram out of the mountains of the east saying come 
curse me jacob and come defy israel 
how shall i curse whom god hath not cursed or how shall i defy 
whom the lord hath not defied for from the top of the rocks i 
see him and from the hills i behold him lo the people shall dwell 
alone and shall not be reckoned among the nations 
who can count the dust of jacob and the number of the fourth 
part of israel let me die the death of the righteous and let my last 
end be like his and balak said unto balaam what hast thou 
done unto me i took thee to curse mine enemies and behold thou 
hast blessed them altogether 
and he answered and said must i not take heed to speak that 
which the lord hath put in my mouth and balak said unto him 
come i pray thee with me unto another place from whence thou mayest 
see them thou shalt see but the utmost part of them and shalt not 
see them all and curse me them from thence 
and he brought him into the field of zophim to the top of 
pisgah and built seven altars and offered a bullock and a ram on 
every altar 
and he said unto balak stand here by thy burnt offering while 
i meet the lord yonder 
and the lord met balaam and put a word in his mouth and said 
go again unto balak and say thus 
and when he came to him behold he stood by his burnt offering 
and the princes of moab with him and balak said unto him what hath 
the lord spoken and he took up his parable and said rise up 
balak and hear hearken unto me thou son of zippor god is not 
a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should 
repent hath he said and shall he not do it or hath he spoken and 
shall he not make it good behold i have received commandment 
to bless and he hath blessed and i cannot reverse it 
he hath not beheld iniquity in jacob neither hath he seen 
perverseness in israel the lord his god is with him and the shout of 
a king is among them 
god brought them out of egypt he hath as it were the strength 
of an unicorn 
surely there is no enchantment against jacob neither is there 
any divination against israel according to this time it shall be said 
of jacob and of israel what hath god wrought behold the 
people shall rise up as a great lion and lift up himself as a young 
lion he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey and drink the 
blood of the slain 
and balak said unto balaam neither curse them at all nor bless 
them at all 
but balaam answered and said unto balak told not i thee 
saying all that the lord speaketh that i must do and balak 
said unto balaam come i pray thee i will bring thee unto another 
place peradventure it will please god that thou mayest curse me them 
from thence 
and balak brought balaam unto the top of peor that looketh 
toward jeshimon 
and balaam said unto balak build me here seven altars and 
prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams 
and balak did as balaam had said and offered a bullock and a 
ram on every altar 
and when balaam saw that it pleased the lord to bless israel he 
went not as at other times to seek for enchantments but he set his 
face toward the wilderness 
and balaam lifted up his eyes and he saw israel abiding in his 
tents according to their tribes and the spirit of god came upon him 
and he took up his parable and said balaam the son of beor hath 
said and the man whose eyes are open hath said he hath said 
which heard the words of god which saw the vision of the almighty 
falling into a trance but having his eyes open how goodly are 
thy tents o jacob and thy tabernacles o israel as the 
valleys are they spread forth as gardens by the river s side as the 
trees of lign aloes which the lord hath planted and as cedar trees 
beside the waters 
he shall pour the water out of his buckets and his seed shall be 
in many waters and his king shall be higher than agag and his 
kingdom shall be exalted 
god brought him forth out of egypt he hath as it were the 
strength of an unicorn he shall eat up the nations his enemies and 
shall break their bones and pierce them through with his arrows 
he couched he lay down as a lion and as a great lion who shall 
stir him up blessed is he that blesseth thee and cursed is he that 
curseth thee 
and balak s anger was kindled against balaam and he smote his 
hands together and balak said unto balaam i called thee to curse 
mine enemies and behold thou hast altogether blessed them these 
three times 
therefore now flee thou to thy place i thought to promote thee 
unto great honour but lo the lord hath kept thee back from honour 
and balaam said unto balak spake i not also to thy messengers 
which thou sentest unto me saying if balak would give me his 
house full of silver and gold i cannot go beyond the commandment of 
the lord to do either good or bad of mine own mind but what the lord 
saith that will i speak and now behold i go unto my people 
come therefore and i will advertise thee what this people shall do to 
thy people in the latter days 
and he took up his parable and said balaam the son of beor 
hath said and the man whose eyes are open hath said he hath 
said which heard the words of god and knew the knowledge of the most 
high which saw the vision of the almighty falling into a trance but 
having his eyes open i shall see him but not now i shall 
behold him but not nigh there shall come a star out of jacob and a 
sceptre shall rise out of israel and shall smite the corners of moab 
and destroy all the children of sheth 
and edom shall be a possession seir also shall be a possession 
for his enemies and israel shall do valiantly 
out of jacob shall come he that shall have dominion and shall 
destroy him that remaineth of the city 
and when he looked on amalek he took up his parable and said 
amalek was the first of the nations but his latter end shall be that 
he perish for ever 
and he looked on the kenites and took up his parable and said 
strong is thy dwellingplace and thou puttest thy nest in a rock 
nevertheless the kenite shall be wasted until asshur shall 
carry thee away captive 
and he took up his parable and said alas who shall live when 
god doeth this and ships shall come from the coast of chittim 
and shall afflict asshur and shall afflict eber and he also shall 
perish for ever 
and balaam rose up and went and returned to his place and 
balak also went his way 
and israel abode in shittim and the people began to commit 
whoredom with the daughters of moab 
and they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods and 
the people did eat and bowed down to their gods 
and israel joined himself unto baalpeor and the anger of the 
lord was kindled against israel 
and the lord said unto moses take all the heads of the people 
and hang them up before the lord against the sun that the fierce 
anger of the lord may be turned away from israel 
and moses said unto the judges of israel slay ye every one his 
men that were joined unto baalpeor 
and behold one of the children of israel came and brought unto 
his brethren a midianitish woman in the sight of moses and in the 
sight of all the congregation of the children of israel who were 
weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation 
and when phinehas the son of eleazar the son of aaron the 
priest saw it he rose up from among the congregation and took a 
javelin in his hand and he went after the man of israel into the 
tent and thrust both of them through the man of israel and the 
woman through her belly so the plague was stayed from the children of 
israel 
and those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand 
and the lord spake unto moses saying phinehas the son 
of eleazar the son of aaron the priest hath turned my wrath away 
from the children of israel while he was zealous for my sake among 
them that i consumed not the children of israel in my jealousy

and moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the 
children of israel saying this is the thing which the lord hath 
commanded 
if a man vow a vow unto the lord or swear an oath to bind his 
soul with a bond he shall not break his word he shall do according 
to all that proceedeth out of his mouth 
if a woman also vow a vow unto the lord and bind herself by a 
bond being in her father s house in her youth and her father 
hear her vow and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul and her 
father shall hold his peace at her then all her vows shall stand and 
every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand 
but if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth not 
any of her vows or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul 
shall stand and the lord shall forgive her because her father 
disallowed her 
and if she had at all an husband when she vowed or uttered 
ought out of her lips wherewith she bound her soul and her 
husband heard it and held his peace at her in the day that he heard 
it then her vows shall stand and her bonds wherewith she bound her 
soul shall stand 
but if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it 
then he shall make her vow which she vowed and that which she uttered 
with her lips wherewith she bound her soul of none effect and the 
lord shall forgive her 
but every vow of a widow and of her that is divorced wherewith 
they have bound their souls shall stand against her 
and if she vowed in her husband s house or bound her soul by a 
bond with an oath and her husband heard it and held his peace 
at her and disallowed her not then all her vows shall stand and 
every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand 
but if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he 
heard them then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her 
vows or concerning the bond of her soul shall not stand her husband 
hath made them void and the lord shall forgive her 
every vow and every binding oath to afflict the soul her 
husband may establish it or her husband may make it void 
but if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to 
day then he establisheth all her vows or all her bonds which are 
upon her he confirmeth them because he held his peace at her in the 
day that he heard them 
but if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard 
them then he shall bear her iniquity 
these are the statutes which the lord commanded moses between 
a man and his wife between the father and his daughter being yet in 
her youth in her father s house 
and the lord spake unto moses saying avenge the children 
of israel of the midianites afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy 
people 
and moses spake unto the people saying arm some of yourselves 
unto the war and let them go against the midianites and avenge the 
lord of midian 
of every tribe a thousand throughout all the tribes of israel 
shall ye send to the war 
so there were delivered out of the thousands of israel a 
thousand of every tribe twelve thousand armed for war 
and moses sent them to the war a thousand of every tribe them 
and phinehas the son of eleazar the priest to the war with the holy 
instruments and the trumpets to blow in his hand 
and they warred against the midianites as the lord commanded 
moses and they slew all the males 
and they slew the kings of midian beside the rest of them that 
were slain namely evi and rekem and zur and hur and reba five 
kings of midian balaam also the son of beor they slew with the sword 
and the children of israel took all the women of midian captives 
and their little ones and took the spoil of all their cattle and all 
their flocks and all their goods 
and they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt and all 
their goodly castles with fire 
and they took all the spoil and all the prey both of men and 
of beasts 
and they brought the captives and the prey and the spoil unto 
moses and eleazar the priest and unto the congregation of the 
children of israel unto the camp at the plains of moab which are by 
jordan near jericho 
and moses and eleazar the priest and all the princes of the 
congregation went forth to meet them without the camp 
and moses was wroth with the officers of the host with the 
captains over thousands and captains over hundreds which came from 
the battle 
and moses said unto them have ye saved all the women alive 
behold these caused the children of israel through the counsel 
of balaam to commit trespass against the lord in the matter of peor 
and there was a plague among the congregation of the lord 
now therefore kill every male among the little ones and kill 
every woman that hath known man by lying with him 
but all the women children that have not known a man by lying 
with him keep alive for yourselves 
and do ye abide without the camp seven days whosoever hath 
killed any person and whosoever hath touched any slain purify both 
yourselves and your captives on the third day and on the seventh day 
and purify all your raiment and all that is made of skins and 
all work of goats hair and all things made of wood 
and eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to 
the battle this is the ordinance of the law which the lord commanded 
moses only the gold and the silver the brass the iron the 
tin and the lead every thing that may abide the fire ye shall 
make it go through the fire and it shall be clean nevertheless it 
shall be purified with the water of separation and all that abideth 
not the fire ye shall make go through the water 
and ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day and ye shall 
be clean and afterward ye shall come into the camp 
and the lord spake unto moses saying take the sum of the 
prey that was taken both of man and of beast thou and eleazar the 
priest and the chief fathers of the congregation and divide 
the prey into two parts between them that took the war upon them who 
went out to battle and between all the congregation and levy a 
tribute unto the lord of the men of war which went out to battle one 
soul of five hundred both of the persons and of the beeves and of 
the asses and of the sheep take it of their half and give it 
unto eleazar the priest for an heave offering of the lord 
and of the children of israel s half thou shalt take one 
portion of fifty of the persons of the beeves of the asses and of 
the flocks of all manner of beasts and give them unto the levites 
which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the lord 
and moses and eleazar the priest did as the lord commanded 
moses 
and the booty being the rest of the prey which the men of war 
had caught was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five 
thousand sheep and threescore and twelve thousand beeves 
and threescore and one thousand asses and thirty and two 
thousand persons in all of women that had not known man by lying with 
him 
and the half which was the portion of them that went out to 
war was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty 
thousand and five hundred sheep and the lord s tribute of the 
sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen 
and the beeves were thirty and six thousand of which the lord s 
tribute was threescore and twelve 
and the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred of which 
the lord s tribute was threescore and one 
and the persons were sixteen thousand of which the lord s 
tribute was thirty and two persons 
and moses gave the tribute which was the lord s heave offering 
unto eleazar the priest as the lord commanded moses 
and of the children of israel s half which moses divided from 
the men that warred now the half that pertained unto the 
congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven 
thousand and five hundred sheep and thirty and six thousand 
beeves and thirty thousand asses and five hundred and 
sixteen thousand persons even of the children of israel s 
half moses took one portion of fifty both of man and of beast and 
gave them unto the levites which kept the charge of the tabernacle of 
the lord as the lord commanded moses 
and the officers which were over thousands of the host the 
captains of thousands and captains of hundreds came near unto moses 
and they said unto moses thy servants have taken the sum of the 
men of war which are under our charge and there lacketh not one man 
of us 
we have therefore brought an oblation for the lord what every 
man hath gotten of jewels of gold chains and bracelets rings 
earrings and tablets to make an atonement for our souls before the 
lord 
and moses and eleazar the priest took the gold of them even all 
wrought jewels 
and all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the 
lord of the captains of thousands and of the captains of hundreds 
was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels 
for the men of war had taken spoil every man for himself 
and moses and eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains 
of thousands and of hundreds and brought it into the tabernacle of 
the congregation for a memorial for the children of israel before the 
lord 
now the children of reuben and the children of gad had a very 
great multitude of cattle and when they saw the land of jazer and 
the land of gilead that behold the place was a place for cattle 
the children of gad and the children of reuben came and spake 
unto moses and to eleazar the priest and unto the princes of the 
congregation saying ataroth and dibon and jazer and nimrah 
and heshbon and elealeh and shebam and nebo and beon even 
the country which the lord smote before the congregation of israel is 
a land for cattle and thy servants have cattle wherefore said 
they if we have found grace in thy sight let this land be given unto 
thy servants for a possession and bring us not over jordan 
and moses said unto the children of gad and to the children of 
reuben shall your brethren go to war and shall ye sit here 
and wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of israel from 
going over into the land which the lord hath given them thus 
did your fathers when i sent them from kadeshbarnea to see the land 
for when they went up unto the valley of eshcol and saw the 
land they discouraged the heart of the children of israel that they 
should not go into the land which the lord had given them 
and the lord s anger was kindled the same time and he sware 
saying surely none of the men that came up out of egypt from 
twenty years old and upward shall see the land which i sware unto 
abraham unto isaac and unto jacob because they have not wholly 
followed me save caleb the son of jephunneh the kenezite and 
joshua the son of nun for they have wholly followed the lord 
and the lord s anger was kindled against israel and he made 
them wander in the wilderness forty years until all the generation 
that had done evil in the sight of the lord was consumed 
and behold ye are risen up in your fathers stead an increase 
of sinful men to augment yet the fierce anger of the lord toward 
israel 
for if ye turn away from after him he will yet again leave them 
in the wilderness and ye shall destroy all this people 
and they came near unto him and said we will build sheepfolds 
here for our cattle and cities for our little ones but we 
ourselves will go ready armed before the children of israel until we 
have brought them unto their place and our little ones shall dwell in 
the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land 
we will not return unto our houses until the children of israel 
have inherited every man his inheritance 
for we will not inherit with them on yonder side jordan or 
forward because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side jordan 
eastward 
and moses said unto them if ye will do this thing if ye will 
go armed before the lord to war and will go all of you armed 
over jordan before the lord until he hath driven out his enemies from 
before him and the land be subdued before the lord then 
afterward ye shall return and be guiltless before the lord and 
before israel and this land shall be your possession before the lord 
but if ye will not do so behold ye have sinned against the 
lord and be sure your sin will find you out 
build you cities for your little ones and folds for your sheep 
and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth 
and the children of gad and the children of reuben spake unto 
moses saying thy servants will do as my lord commandeth 
our little ones our wives our flocks and all our cattle 
shall be there in the cities of gilead but thy servants will 
pass over every man armed for war before the lord to battle as my 
lord saith 
so concerning them moses commanded eleazar the priest and 
joshua the son of nun and the chief fathers of the tribes of the 
children of israel and moses said unto them if the children of 
gad and the children of reuben will pass with you over jordan every 
man armed to battle before the lord and the land shall be subdued 
before you then ye shall give them the land of gilead for a 
possession but if they will not pass over with you armed they 
shall have possessions among you in the land of canaan 
and the children of gad and the children of reuben answered 
saying as the lord hath said unto thy servants so will we do 
we will pass over armed before the lord into the land of canaan 
that the possession of our inheritance on this side jordan may be 
ours 
and moses gave unto them even to the children of gad and to 
the children of reuben and unto half the tribe of manasseh the son of 
joseph the kingdom of sihon king of the amorites and the kingdom of 
og king of bashan the land with the cities thereof in the coasts 
even the cities of the country round about 
and the children of gad built dibon and ataroth and aroer 
and atroth shophan and jaazer and jogbehah and 
bethnimrah and bethharan fenced cities and folds for sheep 
and the children of reuben built heshbon and elealeh and 
kirjathaim and nebo and baalmeon their names being changed 
and shibmah and gave other names unto the cities which they builded 
and the children of machir the son of manasseh went to gilead 
and took it and dispossessed the amorite which was in it 
and moses gave gilead unto machir the son of manasseh and he 
dwelt therein 
and jair the son of manasseh went and took the small towns 
thereof and called them havothjair 
and nobah went and took kenath and the villages thereof and 
called it nobah after his own name 
these are the journeys of the children of israel which went 
forth out of the land of egypt with their armies under the hand of 
moses and aaron 
and moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by 
the commandment of the lord and these are their journeys according to 
their goings out 
and they departed from rameses in the first month on the 
fifteenth day of the first month on the morrow after the passover the 
children of israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the 
egyptians 
for the egyptians buried all their firstborn which the lord had 
smitten among them upon their gods also the lord executed judgments 
and the children of israel removed from rameses and pitched in 
succoth 
and they departed from succoth and pitched in etham which is in 
the edge of the wilderness 
and they removed from etham and turned again unto pihahiroth 
which is before baalzephon and they pitched before migdol 
and they departed from before pihahiroth and passed through the 
midst of the sea into the wilderness and went three days journey in 
the wilderness of etham and pitched in marah 
and they removed from marah and came unto elim and in elim were 
twelve fountains of water and threescore and ten palm trees and they 
pitched there 
and they removed from elim and encamped by the red sea

wilderness of sin 
and they took their journey out of the wilderness of sin and 
encamped in dophkah 
and they departed from dophkah and encamped in alush

and they departed from moseroth and pitched in benejaakan 
and they removed from benejaakan and encamped at horhagidgad 
and they went from horhagidgad and pitched in jotbathah 
and they removed from jotbathah and encamped at ebronah 
and they departed from ebronah and encamped at eziongaber 
and they removed from eziongaber and pitched in the wilderness 
of zin which is kadesh 
and they removed from kadesh and pitched in mount hor in the 
edge of the land of edom 
and aaron the priest went up into mount hor at the commandment 
of the lord and died there in the fortieth year after the children 
of israel were come out of the land of egypt in the first day of the 
fifth month 
and aaron was an hundred and twenty and three years old when he 
died in mount hor 
and king arad the canaanite which dwelt in the south in the 
land of canaan heard of the coming of the children of israel 
and they departed from mount hor and pitched in zalmonah 
and they departed from zalmonah and pitched in punon 
and they departed from punon and pitched in oboth

and they removed from dibongad and encamped in almondiblathaim 
and they removed from almondiblathaim and pitched in the 
mountains of abarim before nebo 
and they departed from the mountains of abarim and pitched in 
the plains of moab by jordan near jericho 
and they pitched by jordan from bethjesimoth even unto 
abelshittim in the plains of moab 
and the lord spake unto moses in the plains of moab by jordan 
near jericho saying speak unto the children of israel and say 
unto them when ye are passed over jordan into the land of canaan 
then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from 
before you and destroy all their pictures and destroy all their 
molten images and quite pluck down all their high places and 
ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land and dwell therein 
for i have given you the land to possess it 
and ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among 
your families and to the more ye shall give the more inheritance and 
to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance every man s 
inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falleth according to 
the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit 
but if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from 
before you then it shall come to pass that those which ye let remain 
of them shall be pricks in your eyes and thorns in your sides and 
shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell 
moreover it shall come to pass that i shall do unto you as i 
thought to do unto them 
and the lord spake unto moses saying command the children 
of israel and say unto them when ye come into the land of canaan 
this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance even 
the land of canaan with the coasts thereof then your south 
quarter shall be from the wilderness of zin along by the coast of 
edom and your south border shall be the outmost coast of the salt sea 
eastward and your border shall turn from the south to the ascent 
of akrabbim and pass on to zin and the going forth thereof shall be 
from the south to kadeshbarnea and shall go on to hazaraddar and 
pass on to azmon and the border shall fetch a compass from azmon 
unto the river of egypt and the goings out of it shall be at the sea 
and as for the western border ye shall even have the great sea 
for a border this shall be your west border 
and this shall be your north border from the great sea ye shall 
point out for you mount hor from mount hor ye shall point out 
your border unto the entrance of hamath and the goings forth of the 
border shall be to zedad and the border shall go on to ziphron 
and the goings out of it shall be at hazarenan this shall be your 
north border 
and ye shall point out your east border from hazarenan to 
shepham and the coast shall go down from shepham to riblah on 
the east side of ain and the border shall descend and shall reach 
unto the side of the sea of chinnereth eastward and the border 
shall go down to jordan and the goings out of it shall be at the salt 
sea this shall be your land with the coasts thereof round about 
and moses commanded the children of israel saying this is the 
land which ye shall inherit by lot which the lord commanded to give 
unto the nine tribes and to the half tribe for the tribe of 
the children of reuben according to the house of their fathers and 
the tribe of the children of gad according to the house of their 
fathers have received their inheritance and half the tribe of 
manasseh have received their inheritance the two tribes and the 
half tribe have received their inheritance on this side jordan near 
jericho eastward toward the sunrising 
and the lord spake unto moses saying these are the names 
of the men which shall divide the land unto you eleazar the priest 
and joshua the son of nun 
and ye shall take one prince of every tribe to divide the land 
by inheritance 
and the names of the men are these of the tribe of judah caleb 
the son of jephunneh 
and of the tribe of the children of simeon shemuel the son of 
ammihud 
of the tribe of benjamin elidad the son of chislon 
and the prince of the tribe of the children of dan bukki the 
son of jogli 
the prince of the children of joseph for the tribe of the 
children of manasseh hanniel the son of ephod 
and the prince of the tribe of the children of ephraim kemuel 
the son of shiphtan 
and the prince of the tribe of the children of zebulun 
elizaphan the son of parnach 
and the prince of the tribe of the children of issachar paltiel 
the son of azzan 
and the prince of the tribe of the children of asher ahihud the 
son of shelomi 
and the prince of the tribe of the children of naphtali pedahel 
the son of ammihud 
these are they whom the lord commanded to divide the inheritance 
unto the children of israel in the land of canaan 
and the lord spake unto moses in the plains of moab by jordan 
near jericho saying command the children of israel that they 
give unto the levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to 
dwell in and ye shall give also unto the levites suburbs for the 
cities round about them 
and the cities shall they have to dwell in and the suburbs of 
them shall be for their cattle and for their goods and for all their 
beasts 
and the suburbs of the cities which ye shall give unto the 
levites shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand 
cubits round about 
and ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two 
thousand cubits and on the south side two thousand cubits and on the 
west side two thousand cubits and on the north side two thousand 
cubits and the city shall be in the midst this shall be to them the 
suburbs of the cities 
and among the cities which ye shall give unto the levites there 
shall be six cities for refuge which ye shall appoint for the 
manslayer that he may flee thither and to them ye shall add forty 
and two cities 
so all the cities which ye shall give to the levites shall be 
forty and eight cities them shall ye give with their suburbs 
and the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession of 
the children of israel from them that have many ye shall give many 
but from them that have few ye shall give few every one shall give of 
his cities unto the levites according to his inheritance which he 
inheriteth 
and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto the 
children of israel and say unto them when ye be come over jordan 
into the land of canaan then ye shall appoint you cities to be 
cities of refuge for you that the slayer may flee thither which 
killeth any person at unawares 
and they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger 
that the manslayer die not until he stand before the congregation in 
judgment 
and of these cities which ye shall give six cities shall ye have 
for refuge 
ye shall give three cities on this side jordan and three cities 
shall ye give in the land of canaan which shall be cities of refuge 
these six cities shall be a refuge both for the children of 
israel and for the stranger and for the sojourner among them that 
every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither 
and if he smite him with an instrument of iron so that he die 
he is a murderer the murderer shall surely be put to death 
and if he smite him with throwing a stone wherewith he may die 
and he die he is a murderer the murderer shall surely be put to 
death 
or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood wherewith he may 
die and he die he is a murderer the murderer shall surely be put to 
death 
the revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer when he 
meeteth him he shall slay him 
but if he thrust him of hatred or hurl at him by laying of 
wait that he die or in enmity smite him with his hand that he 
die he that smote him shall surely be put to death for he is a 
murderer the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer when he 
meeteth him 
but if he thrust him suddenly without enmity or have cast upon 
him any thing without laying of wait or with any stone 
wherewith a man may die seeing him not and cast it upon him that he 
die and was not his enemy neither sought his harm then the 
congregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of blood 
according to these judgments and the congregation shall deliver 
the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood and the 
congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge whither he 
was fled and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest 
which was anointed with the holy oil 
but if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of 
the city of his refuge whither he was fled and the revenger of 
blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge and the 
revenger of blood kill the slayer he shall not be guilty of blood 
because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until 
the death of the high priest but after the death of the high priest 
the slayer shall return into the land of his possession 
so these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you 
throughout your generations in all your dwellings 
whoso killeth any person the murderer shall be put to death by 
the mouth of witnesses but one witness shall not testify against any 
person to cause him to die 
moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a 
murderer which is guilty of death but he shall be surely put to 
death 
and ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the 
city of his refuge that he should come again to dwell in the land 
until the death of the priest 
so ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are for blood it 
defileth the land and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that 
is she would therein but by the blood of him that she would it 
defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit wherein i 
dwell for i the lord dwell among the children of israel 
and the chief fathers of the families of the children of gilead 
the son of machir the son of manasseh of the families of the sons of 
joseph came near and spake before moses and before the princes the 
chief fathers of the children of israel and they said the lord 
commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the 
children of israel and my lord was commanded by the lord to give the 
inheritance of zelophehad our brother unto his daughters 
and if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of 
the children of israel then shall their inheritance be taken from the 
inheritance of our fathers and shall be put to the inheritance of the 
tribe whereunto they are received so shall it be taken from the lot 
of our inheritance 
and when the jubile of the children of israel shall be then 
shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe 
whereunto they are received so shall their inheritance be taken away 
from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers 
and moses commanded the children of israel according to the word 
of the lord saying the tribe of the sons of joseph hath said well 
this is the thing which the lord doth command concerning the 
daughters of zelophehad saying let them marry to whom they think 
best only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they 
marry 
so shall not the inheritance of the children of israel remove 
from tribe to tribe for every one of the children of israel shall 
keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers 
and every daughter that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe 
of the children of israel shall be wife unto one of the family of the 
tribe of her father that the children of israel may enjoy every man 
the inheritance of his fathers 
neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another 
tribe but every one of the tribes of the children of israel shall 
keep himself to his own inheritance 
even as the lord commanded moses so did the daughters of 
zelophehad for mahlah tirzah and hoglah and milcah and 
noah the daughters of zelophehad were married unto their father s 
brothers sons and they were married into the families of the 
sons of manasseh the son of joseph and their inheritance remained in 
the tribe of the family of their father 
these are the commandments and the judgments which the lord 
commanded by the hand of moses unto the children of israel in the 
plains of moab by jordan near jericho 
the fifth book of moses called deuteronomy 
these be the words which moses spake unto all israel on this side 
jordan in the wilderness in the plain over against the red sea 
between paran and tophel and laban and hazeroth and dizahab 
there are eleven days journey from horeb by the way of mount 
seir unto kadeshbarnea and it came to pass in the fortieth 
year in the eleventh month on the first day of the month that moses 
spake unto the children of israel according unto all that the lord 
had given him in commandment unto them after he had slain sihon 
the king of the amorites which dwelt in heshbon and og the king of 
bashan which dwelt at astaroth in edrei on this side jordan in 
the land of moab began moses to declare this law saying the 
lord our god spake unto us in horeb saying ye have dwelt long enough 
in this mount turn you and take your journey and go to the 
mount of the amorites and unto all the places nigh thereunto in the 
plain in the hills and in the vale and in the south and by the sea 
side to the land of the canaanites and unto lebanon unto the great 
river the river euphrates 
behold i have set the land before you go in and possess the land 
which the lord sware unto your fathers abraham isaac and jacob to 
give unto them and to their seed after them 
and i spake unto you at that time saying i am not able to bear 
you myself alone the lord your god hath multiplied you and 
behold ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude 
the lord god of your fathers make you a thousand times so many 
more as ye are and bless you as he hath promised you how can 
i myself alone bear your cumbrance and your burden and your strife 
take you wise men and understanding and known among your 
tribes and i will make them rulers over you 
and ye answered me and said the thing which thou hast spoken is 
good for us to do 
so i took the chief of your tribes wise men and known and made 
them heads over you captains over thousands and captains over 
hundreds and captains over fifties and captains over tens and 
officers among your tribes 
and i charged your judges at that time saying hear the causes 
between your brethren and judge righteously between every man and his 
brother and the stranger that is with him 
ye shall not respect persons in judgment but ye shall hear the 
small as well as the great ye shall not be afraid of the face of man 
for the judgment is god s and the because that is too hard for you 
bring it unto me and i will hear it 
and i commanded you at that time all the things which ye should 
do 
and when we departed from horeb we went through all that great 
and terrible wilderness which ye saw by the way of the mountain of 
the amorites as the lord our god commanded us and we came to 
kadeshbarnea 
and i said unto you ye are come unto the mountain of the 
amorites which the lord our god doth give unto us 
behold the lord thy god hath set the land before thee go up and 
possess it as the lord god of thy fathers hath said unto thee fear 
not neither be discouraged 
and ye came near unto me every one of you and said we will send 
men before us and they shall search us out the land and bring us 
word again by what way we must go up and into what cities we shall 
come 
and the saying pleased me well and i took twelve men of you one 
of a tribe and they turned and went up into the mountain and 
came unto the valley of eshcol and searched it out 
and they took of the fruit of the land in their hands and 
brought it down unto us and brought us word again and said it is a 
good land which the lord our god doth give us 
notwithstanding ye would not go up but rebelled against the 
commandment of the lord your god and ye murmured in your tents 
and said because the lord hated us he hath brought us forth out of 
the land of egypt to deliver us into the hand of the amorites to 
destroy us 
whither shall we go up our brethren have discouraged our heart 
saying the people is greater and taller than we the cities are great 
and walled up to heaven and moreover we have seen the sons of the 
anakims there 
then i said unto you dread not neither be afraid of them 
the lord your god which goeth before you he shall fight for you 
according to all that he did for you in egypt before your eyes 
and in the wilderness where thou hast seen how that the lord thy god 
bare thee as a man doth bear his son in all the way that ye went 
until ye came into this place 
yet in this thing ye did not believe the lord your god who 
went in the way before you to search you out a place to pitch your 
tents in in fire by night to shew you by what way ye should go and 
in a cloud by day 
and the lord heard the voice of your words and was wroth and 
sware saying surely there shall not one of these men of this 
evil generation see that good land which i sware to give unto your 
fathers 
save caleb the son of jephunneh he shall see it and to him will 
i give the land that he hath trodden upon and to his children 
because he hath wholly followed the lord 
also the lord was angry with me for your sakes saying thou also 
shalt not go in thither 
but joshua the son of nun which standeth before thee he shall 
go in thither encourage him for he shall cause israel to inherit it 
moreover your little ones which ye said should be a prey and 
your children which in that day had no knowledge between good and 
evil they shall go in thither and unto them will i give it and they 
shall possess it 
but as for you turn you and take your journey into the 
wilderness by the way of the red sea 
then ye answered and said unto me we have sinned against the 
lord we will go up and fight according to all that the lord our god 
commanded us 
and when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war ye were ready 
to go up into the hill 
and the lord said unto me say unto them go not up neither 
fight for i am not among you lest ye be smitten before your enemies 
so i spake unto you and ye would not hear but rebelled against 
the commandment of the lord and went presumptuously up into the hill 
and the amorites which dwelt in that mountain came out against 
you and chased you as bees do and destroyed you in seir even unto 
hormah 
and ye returned and wept before the lord but the lord would not 
hearken to your voice nor give ear unto you 
so ye abode in kadesh many days according unto the days that ye 
abode there 
then we turned and took our journey into the wilderness by the 
way of the red sea as the lord spake unto me and we compassed mount 
seir many days 
and the lord spake unto me saying ye have compassed this 
mountain long enough turn you northward 
and command thou the people saying ye are to pass through the 
coast of your brethren the children of esau which dwell in seir and 
they shall be afraid of you take ye good heed unto yourselves 
therefore meddle not with them for i will not give you of their 
land no not so much as a foot breadth because i have given mount 
seir unto esau for a possession 
ye shall buy meat of them for money that ye may eat and ye shall 
also buy water of them for money that ye may drink 
for the lord thy god hath blessed thee in all the works of thy 
hand he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness these 
forty years the lord thy god hath been with thee thou hast lacked 
nothing 
and when we passed by from our brethren the children of esau 
which dwelt in seir through the way of the plain from elath and from 
eziongaber we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of moab 
and the lord said unto me distress not the moabites neither 
contend with them in battle for i will not give thee of their land 
for a possession because i have given ar unto the children of lot for 
a possession 
the emims dwelt therein in times past a people great and many 
and tall as the anakims which also were accounted giants as 
the anakims but the moabites called them emims 
the horims also dwelt in seir beforetime but the children of 
esau succeeded them when they had destroyed them from before them 
and dwelt in their stead as israel did unto the land of his 
possession which the lord gave unto them 
now rise up said i and get you over the brook zered and we 
went over the brook zered 
and the space in which we came from kadeshbarnea until we were 
come over the brook zered was thirty and eight years until all the 
generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host as 
the lord sware unto them 
for indeed the hand of the lord was against them to destroy them 
from among the host until they were consumed 
so it came to pass when all the men of war were consumed and 
dead from among the people that the lord spake unto me saying 
thou art to pass over through ar the coast of moab this day 
and when thou comest nigh over against the children of ammon 
distress them not nor meddle with them for i will not give thee of 
the land of the children of ammon any possession because i have given 
it unto the children of lot for a possession 
that also was accounted a land of giants giants dwelt therein 
in old time and the ammonites call them zamzummims a people 
great and many and tall as the anakims but the lord destroyed them 
before them and they succeeded them and dwelt in their stead 
as he did to the children of esau which dwelt in seir when he 
destroyed the horims from before them and they succeeded them and 
dwelt in their stead even unto this day and the avims which 
dwelt in hazerim even unto azzah the caphtorims which came forth 
out of caphtor destroyed them and dwelt in their stead rise 
ye up take your journey and pass over the river arnon behold i 
have given into thine hand sihon the amorite king of heshbon and his 
land begin to possess it and contend with him in battle 
this day will i begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of 
thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven who shall hear 
report of thee and shall tremble and be in anguish because of thee 
and i sent messengers out of the wilderness of kedemoth unto 
sihon king of heshbon with words of peace saying let me pass 
through thy land i will go along by the high way i will neither turn 
unto the right hand nor to the left 
thou shalt sell me meat for money that i may eat and give me 
water for money that i may drink only i will pass through on my 
feet as the children of esau which dwell in seir and the 
moabites which dwell in ar did unto me until i shall pass over 
jordan into the land which the lord our god giveth us 
but sihon king of heshbon would not let us pass by him for the 
lord thy god hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate that 
he might deliver him into thy hand as appeareth this day 
and the lord said unto me behold i have begun to give sihon and 
his land before thee begin to possess that thou mayest inherit his 
land 
then sihon came out against us he and all his people to fight 
at jahaz 
and the lord our god delivered him before us and we smote him 
and his sons and all his people 
and we took all his cities at that time and utterly destroyed 
the men and the women and the little ones of every city we left 
none to remain only the cattle we took for a prey unto 
ourselves and the spoil of the cities which we took 
from aroer which is by the brink of the river of arnon and from 
the city that is by the river even unto gilead there was not one 
city too strong for us the lord our god delivered all unto us 
only unto the land of the children of ammon thou camest not nor unto 
any place of the river jabbok nor unto the cities in the mountains 
nor unto whatsoever the lord our god forbad us 
then we turned and went up the way to bashan and og the king of 
bashan came out against us he and all his people to battle at edrei 
and the lord said unto me fear him not for i will deliver him 
and all his people and his land into thy hand and thou shalt do 
unto him as thou didst unto sihon king of the amorites which dwelt at 
heshbon 
so the lord our god delivered into our hands og also the king of 
bashan and all his people and we smote him until none was left to 
him remaining 
and we took all his cities at that time there was not a city 
which we took not from them threescore cities all the region of 
argob the kingdom of og in bashan 
all these cities were fenced with high walls gates and bars 
beside unwalled towns a great many 
and we utterly destroyed them as we did unto sihon king of 
heshbon utterly destroying the men women and children of every 
city 
but all the cattle and the spoil of the cities we took for a 
prey to ourselves 
and we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the 
amorites the land that was on this side jordan from the river of 
arnon unto mount hermon which hermon the sidonians call sirion 
and the amorites call it shenir all the cities of the plain 
and all gilead and all bashan unto salchah and edrei cities of the 
kingdom of og in bashan 
for only og king of bashan remained of the remnant of giants 
behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron is it not in rabbath of 
the children of ammon nine cubits was the length thereof and four 
cubits the breadth of it after the cubit of a man 
and this land which we possessed at that time from aroer which 
is by the river arnon and half mount gilead and the cities thereof 
gave i unto the reubenites and to the gadites 
and the rest of gilead and all bashan being the kingdom of og 
gave i unto the half tribe of manasseh all the region of argob with 
all bashan which was called the land of giants 
jair the son of manasseh took all the country of argob unto the 
coasts of geshuri and maachathi and called them after his own name 
bashanhavothjair unto this day 
and i gave gilead unto machir 
and unto the reubenites and unto the gadites i gave from gilead 
even unto the river arnon half the valley and the border even unto 
the river jabbok which is the border of the children of ammon 
the plain also and jordan and the coast thereof from chinnereth 
even unto the sea of the plain even the salt sea under ashdothpisgah 
eastward 
and i commanded you at that time saying the lord your god hath 
given you this land to possess it ye shall pass over armed before 
your brethren the children of israel all that are meet for the war 
but your wives and your little ones and your cattle for i 
know that ye have much cattle shall abide in your cities which i 
have given you until the lord have given rest unto your 
brethren as well as unto you and until they also possess the land 
which the lord your god hath given them beyond jordan and then shall 
ye return every man unto his possession which i have given you 
and i commanded joshua at that time saying thine eyes have seen 
all that the lord your god hath done unto these two kings so shall 
the lord do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest 
ye shall not fear them for the lord your god he shall fight for 
you 
and i besought the lord at that time saying o lord god 
thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness and thy mighty 
hand for what god is there in heaven or in earth that can do 
according to thy works and according to thy might i pray thee 
let me go over and see the good land that is beyond jordan that 
goodly mountain and lebanon 
but the lord was wroth with me for your sakes and would not hear 
me and the lord said unto me let it suffice thee speak no more unto 
me of this matter 
get thee up into the top of pisgah and lift up thine eyes 
westward and northward and southward and eastward and behold it 
with thine eyes for thou shalt not go over this jordan 
but charge joshua and encourage him and strengthen him for he 
shall go over before this people and he shall cause them to inherit 
the land which thou shalt see 
so we abode in the valley over against bethpeor 
now therefore hearken o israel unto the statutes and unto the 
judgments which i teach you for to do them that ye may live and go 
in and possess the land which the lord god of your fathers giveth you 
ye shall not add unto the word which i command you neither shall 
ye diminish ought from it that ye may keep the commandments of the 
lord your god which i command you 
your eyes have seen what the lord did because of baalpeor for all 
the men that followed baalpeor the lord thy god hath destroyed them 
from among you 
but ye that did cleave unto the lord your god are alive every one 
of you this day 
behold i have taught you statutes and judgments even as the lord 
my god commanded me that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to 
possess it 
keep therefore and do them for this is your wisdom and your 
understanding in the sight of the nations which shall hear all these 
statutes and say surely this great nation is a wise and 
understanding people 
for what nation is there so great who hath god so nigh unto them 
as the lord our god is in all things that we call upon him for 
and what nation is there so great that hath statutes and judgments so 
righteous as all this law which i set before you this day only 
take heed to thyself and keep thy soul diligently lest thou forget 
the things which thine eyes have seen and lest they depart from thy 
heart all the days of thy life but teach them thy sons and thy sons 
sons specially the day that thou stoodest before the lord thy 
god in horeb when the lord said unto me gather me the people 
together and i will make them hear my words that they may learn to 
fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth and that 
they may teach their children 
and ye came near and stood under the mountain and the mountain 
burned with fire unto the midst of heaven with darkness clouds and 
thick darkness 
and the lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire ye 
heard the voice of the words but saw no similitude only ye heard a 
voice 
and he declared unto you his covenant which he commanded you to 
perform even ten commandments and he wrote them upon two tables of 
stone 
and the lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and 
judgments that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to 
possess it 
take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves for ye saw no manner 
of similitude on the day that the lord spake unto you in horeb out of 
the midst of the fire lest ye corrupt yourselves and make you a 
graven image the similitude of any figure the likeness of male or 
female the likeness of any beast that is on the earth the 
likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air the likeness 
of any thing that creepeth on the ground the likeness of any fish 
that is in the waters beneath the earth and lest thou lift up 
thine eyes unto heaven and when thou seest the sun and the moon and 
the stars even all the host of heaven shouldest be driven to worship 
them and serve them which the lord thy god hath divided unto all 
nations under the whole heaven 
but the lord hath taken you and brought you forth out of the 
iron furnace even out of egypt to be unto him a people of 
inheritance as ye are this day 
furthermore the lord was angry with me for your sakes and sware 
that i should not go over jordan and that i should not go in unto 
that good land which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance 
but i must die in this land i must not go over jordan but ye 
shall go over and possess that good land 
take heed unto yourselves lest ye forget the covenant of the 
lord your god which he made with you and make you a graven image or 
the likeness of any thing which the lord thy god hath forbidden thee 
for the lord thy god is a consuming fire even a jealous god 
when thou shalt beget children and children s children and ye 
shall have remained long in the land and shall corrupt yourselves 
and make a graven image or the likeness of any thing and shall do 
evil in the sight of the lord thy god to provoke him to anger i 
call heaven and earth to witness against you this day that ye shall 
soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over jordan to 
possess it ye shall not prolong your days upon it but shall utterly 
be destroyed 
and the lord shall scatter you among the nations and ye shall be 
left few in number among the heathen whither the lord shall lead you 
and there ye shall serve gods the work of men s hands wood and 
stone which neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell 
but if from thence thou shalt seek the lord thy god thou shalt 
find him if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul 
when thou art in tribulation and all these things are come upon 
thee even in the latter days if thou turn to the lord thy god and 
shalt be obedient unto his voice for the lord thy god is a 
merciful god he will not forsake thee neither destroy thee nor 
forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them 
for ask now of the days that are past which were before thee 
since the day that god created man upon the earth and ask from the 
one side of heaven unto the other whether there hath been any such 
thing as this great thing is or hath been heard like it did 
ever people hear the voice of god speaking out of the midst of the 
fire as thou hast heard and live or hath god assayed to go 
and take him a nation from the midst of another nation by 
temptations by signs and by wonders and by war and by a mighty 
hand and by a stretched out arm and by great terrors according to 
all that the lord your god did for you in egypt before your eyes 
unto thee it was shewed that thou mightest know that the lord he 
is god there is none else beside him 
out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice that he might 
instruct thee and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire and thou 
heardest his words out of the midst of the fire 
and because he loved thy fathers therefore he chose their seed 
after them and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power 
out of egypt to drive out nations from before thee greater and 
mightier than thou art to bring thee in to give thee their land for 
an inheritance as it is this day 
know therefore this day and consider it in thine heart that the 
lord he is god in heaven above and upon the earth beneath there is 
none else 
thou shalt keep therefore his statutes and his commandments 
which i command thee this day that it may go well with thee and with 
thy children after thee and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon 
the earth which the lord thy god giveth thee for ever 
then moses severed three cities on this side jordan toward the 
sunrising that the slayer might flee thither which should kill 
his neighbour unawares and hated him not in times past and that 
fleeing unto one of these cities he might live namely bezer in 
the wilderness in the plain country of the reubenites and ramoth in 
gilead of the gadites and golan in bashan of the manassites 
and this is the law which moses set before the children of 
israel these are the testimonies and the statutes and the 
judgments which moses spake unto the children of israel after they 
came forth out of egypt 
on this side jordan in the valley over against bethpeor in the 
land of sihon king of the amorites who dwelt at heshbon whom moses 
and the children of israel smote after they were come forth out of 
egypt and they possessed his land and the land of og king of 
bashan two kings of the amorites which were on this side jordan 
toward the sunrising from aroer which is by the bank of the 
river arnon even unto mount sion which is hermon and all the 
plain on this side jordan eastward even unto the sea of the plain 
under the springs of pisgah 
and moses called all israel and said unto them hear o israel 
the statutes and judgments which i speak in your ears this day that 
ye may learn them and keep and do them 
the lord our god made a covenant with us in horeb 
the lord made not this covenant with our fathers but with us 
even us who are all of us here alive this day 
the lord talked with you face to face in the mount out of the 
midst of the fire i stood between the lord and you at that time 
to shew you the word of the lord for ye were afraid by reason of the 
fire and went not up into the mount saying i am the lord thy 
god which brought thee out of the land of egypt from the house of 
bondage 
thou shalt have none other gods before me 
thou shalt not make thee any graven image or any likeness of any 
thing that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or 
that is in the waters beneath the earth thou shalt not bow down 
thyself unto them nor serve them for i the lord thy god am a jealous 
god visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the 
third and fourth generation of them that hate me and shewing 
mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments 
thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain for the 
lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain 
keep the sabbath day to sanctify it as the lord thy god hath 
commanded thee 
six days thou shalt labour and do all thy work but the 
seventh day is the sabbath of the lord thy god in it thou shalt not 
do any work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter nor thy manservant 
nor thy maidservant nor thine ox nor thine ass nor any of thy 
cattle nor thy stranger that is within thy gates that thy manservant 
and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou 
and remember that thou wast a servant in the land of egypt and 
that the lord thy god brought thee out thence through a mighty hand 
and by a stretched out arm therefore the lord thy god commanded thee 
to keep the sabbath day 
honour thy father and thy mother as the lord thy god hath 
commanded thee that thy days may be prolonged and that it may go 
well with thee in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee 
thou shalt not kill 
neither shalt thou commit adultery 
neither shalt thou steal 
neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour 
neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour s wife neither shalt 
thou covet thy neighbour s house his field or his manservant or his 
maidservant his ox or his ass or any thing that is thy neighbour s 
these words the lord spake unto all your assembly in the mount 
out of the midst of the fire of the cloud and of the thick darkness 
with a great voice and he added no more and he wrote them in two 
tables of stone and delivered them unto me 
and it came to pass when ye heard the voice out of the midst of 
the darkness for the mountain did burn with fire that ye came near 
unto me even all the heads of your tribes and your elders and 
ye said behold the lord our god hath shewed us his glory and his 
greatness and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire 
we have seen this day that god doth talk with man and he liveth 
now therefore why should we die for this great fire will consume 
us if we hear the voice of the lord our god any more then we shall 
die 
for who is there of all flesh that hath heard the voice of the 
living god speaking out of the midst of the fire as we have and 
lived go thou near and hear all that the lord our god shall 
say and speak thou unto us all that the lord our god shall speak unto 
thee and we will hear it and do it 
and the lord heard the voice of your words when ye spake unto 
me and the lord said unto me i have heard the voice of the words of 
this people which they have spoken unto thee they have well said all 
that they have spoken 
o that there were such an heart in them that they would fear me 
and keep all my commandments always that it might be well with them 
and with their children for ever go say to them get you into 
your tents again 
but as for thee stand thou here by me and i will speak unto 
thee all the commandments and the statutes and the judgments which 
thou shalt teach them that they may do them in the land which i give 
them to possess it 
ye shall observe to do therefore as the lord your god hath 
commanded you ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the 
left 
ye shall walk in all the ways which the lord your god hath 
commanded you that ye may live and that it may be well with you and 
that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess 
now these are the commandments the statutes and the judgments 
which the lord your god commanded to teach you that ye might do them 
in the land whither ye go to possess it that thou mightest fear 
the lord thy god to keep all his statutes and his commandments which 
i command thee thou and thy son and thy son s son all the days of 
thy life and that thy days may be prolonged 
hear therefore o israel and observe to do it that it may be 
well with thee and that ye may increase mightily as the lord god of 
thy fathers hath promised thee in the land that floweth with milk and 
honey 
hear o israel the lord our god is one lord and thou shalt 
love the lord thy god with all thine heart and with all thy soul and 
with all thy might 
and these words which i command thee this day shall be in thine 
heart and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and 
shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house and when thou 
walkest by the way and when thou liest down and when thou risest up 
and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand and they 
shall be as frontlets between thine eyes 
and thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house and on thy 
gates 
and it shall be when the lord thy god shall have brought thee 
into the land which he sware unto thy fathers to abraham to isaac 
and to jacob to give thee great and goodly cities which thou 
buildedst not and houses full of all good things which thou 
filledst not and wells digged which thou diggedst not vineyards and 
olive trees which thou plantedst not when thou shalt have eaten and 
be full then beware lest thou forget the lord which brought 
thee forth out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage 
thou shalt fear the lord thy god and serve him and shalt swear 
by his name 
ye shall not go after other gods of the gods of the people which 
are round about you for the lord thy god is a jealous god among 
you lest the anger of the lord thy god be kindled against thee and 
destroy thee from off the face of the earth 
ye shall not tempt the lord your god as ye tempted him in 
massah 
ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the lord your god 
and his testimonies and his statutes which he hath commanded thee 
and thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of 
the lord that it may be well with thee and that thou mayest go in 
and possess the good land which the lord sware unto thy fathers 
to cast out all thine enemies from before thee as the lord hath 
spoken 
and when thy son asketh thee in time to come saying what mean 
the testimonies and the statutes and the judgments which the lord 
our god hath commanded you then thou shalt say unto thy son we 
were pharaoh s bondmen in egypt and the lord brought us out of egypt 
with a mighty hand and the lord shewed signs and wonders great 
and sore upon egypt upon pharaoh and upon all his household before 
our eyes and he brought us out from thence that he might bring 
us in to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers 
and the lord commanded us to do all these statutes to fear the 
lord our god for our good always that he might preserve us alive as 
it is at this day 
and it shall be our righteousness if we observe to do all these 
commandments before the lord our god as he hath commanded us 
when the lord thy god shall bring thee into the land whither thou 
goest to possess it and hath cast out many nations before thee the 
hittites and the girgashites and the amorites and the canaanites 
and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites seven nations 
greater and mightier than thou and when the lord thy god shall 
deliver them before thee thou shalt smite them and utterly destroy 
them thou shalt make no covenant with them nor shew mercy unto them 
neither shalt thou make marriages with them thy daughter thou 
shalt not give unto his son nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy 
son 
for they will turn away thy son from following me that they may 
serve other gods so will the anger of the lord be kindled against 
you and destroy thee suddenly 
but thus shall ye deal with them ye shall destroy their altars 
and break down their images and cut down their groves and burn their 
graven images with fire 
for thou art an holy people unto the lord thy god the lord thy 
god hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all 
people that are upon the face of the earth 
the lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because ye 
were more in number than any people for ye were the fewest of all 
people but because the lord loved you and because he would keep 
the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers hath the lord brought 
you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of 
bondmen from the hand of pharaoh king of egypt 
know therefore that the lord thy god he is god the faithful god 
which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his 
commandments to a thousand generations and repayeth them that 
hate him to their face to destroy them he will not be slack to him 
that hateth him he will repay him to his face 
thou shalt therefore keep the commandments and the statutes and 
the judgments which i command thee this day to do them 
wherefore it shall come to pass if ye hearken to these 
judgments and keep and do them that the lord thy god shall keep 
unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers 
and he will love thee and bless thee and multiply thee he will 
also bless the fruit of thy womb and the fruit of thy land thy corn 
and thy wine and thine oil the increase of thy kine and the flocks 
of thy sheep in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give 
thee 
thou shalt be blessed above all people there shall not be male 
or female barren among you or among your cattle 
and the lord will take away from thee all sickness and will put 
none of the evil diseases of egypt which thou knowest upon thee but 
will lay them upon all them that hate thee 
and thou shalt consume all the people which the lord thy god 
shall deliver thee thine eye shall have no pity upon them neither 
shalt thou serve their gods for that will be a snare unto thee 
if thou shalt say in thine heart these nations are more than i 
how can i dispossess them thou shalt not be afraid of them but 
shalt well remember what the lord thy god did unto pharaoh and unto 
all egypt the great temptations which thine eyes saw and the 
signs and the wonders and the mighty hand and the stretched out 
arm whereby the lord thy god brought thee out so shall the lord thy 
god do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid 
moreover the lord thy god will send the hornet among them until 
they that are left and hide themselves from thee be destroyed 
thou shalt not be affrighted at them for the lord thy god is 
among you a mighty god and terrible 
and the lord thy god will put out those nations before thee by 
little and little thou mayest not consume them at once lest the 
beasts of the field increase upon thee 
but the lord thy god shall deliver them unto thee and shall 
destroy them with a mighty destruction until they be destroyed 
and he shall deliver their kings into thine hand and thou shalt 
destroy their name from under heaven there shall no man be able to 
stand before thee until thou have destroyed them 
the graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire thou 
shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them nor take it unto 
thee lest thou be snared therin for it is an abomination to the lord 
thy god 
neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house lest 
thou be a cursed thing like it but thou shalt utterly detest it and 
thou shalt utterly abhor it for it is a cursed thing 
all the commandments which i command thee this day shall ye 
observe to do that ye may live and multiply and go in and possess 
the land which the lord sware unto your fathers 
and thou shalt remember all the way which the lord thy god led 
thee these forty years in the wilderness to humble thee and to prove 
thee to know what was in thine heart whether thou wouldest keep his 
commandments or no 
and he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger and fed thee 
with manna which thou knewest not neither did thy fathers know that 
he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only but by 
every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the lord doth man live 
thy raiment waxed not old upon thee neither did thy foot swell 
these forty years 
thou shalt also consider in thine heart that as a man chasteneth 
his son so the lord thy god chasteneth thee 
therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the lord thy god to 
walk in his ways and to fear him 
for the lord thy god bringeth thee into a good land a land of 
brooks of water of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys 
and hills a land of wheat and barley and vines and fig trees 
and pomegranates a land of oil olive and honey a land wherein 
thou shalt eat bread without scarceness thou shalt not lack any thing 
in it a land whose stones are iron and out of whose hills thou 
mayest dig brass 
when thou hast eaten and art full then thou shalt bless the lord 
thy god for the good land which he hath given thee 
beware that thou forget not the lord thy god in not keeping his 
commandments and his judgments and his statutes which i command 
thee this day lest when thou hast eaten and art full and hast 
built goodly houses and dwelt therein and when thy herds and 
thy flocks multiply and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied and 
all that thou hast is multiplied then thine heart be lifted up 
and thou forget the lord thy god which brought thee forth out of the 
land of egypt from the house of bondage who led thee through 
that great and terrible wilderness wherein were fiery serpents and 
scorpions and drought where there was no water who brought thee 
forth water out of the rock of flint who fed thee in the 
wilderness with manna which thy fathers knew not that he might 
humble thee and that he might prove thee to do thee good at thy 
latter end and thou say in thine heart my power and the might 
of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth 
but thou shalt remember the lord thy god for it is he that 
giveth thee power to get wealth that he may establish his covenant 
which he sware unto thy fathers as it is this day 
and it shall be if thou do at all forget the lord thy god and 
walk after other gods and serve them and worship them i testify 
against you this day that ye shall surely perish 
as the nations which the lord destroyeth before your face so 
shall ye perish because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of 
the lord your god 
hear o israel thou art to pass over jordan this day to go in to 
possess nations greater and mightier than thyself cities great and 
fenced up to heaven a people great and tall the children of the 
anakims whom thou knowest and of whom thou hast heard say who can 
stand before the children of anak understand therefore this day 
that the lord thy god is he which goeth over before thee as a 
consuming fire he shall destroy them and he shall bring them down 
before thy face so shalt thou drive them out and destroy them 
quickly as the lord hath said unto thee 
speak not thou in thine heart after that the lord thy god hath 
cast them out from before thee saying for my righteousness the lord 
hath brought me in to possess this land but for the wickedness of 
these nations the lord doth drive them out from before thee 
not for thy righteousness or for the uprightness of thine heart 
dost thou go to possess their land but for the wickedness of these 
nations the lord thy god doth drive them out from before thee and 
that he may perform the word which the lord sware unto thy fathers 
abraham isaac and jacob 
understand therefore that the lord thy god giveth thee not this 
good land to possess it for thy righteousness for thou art a 
stiffnecked people 
remember and forget not how thou provokedst the lord thy god to 
wrath in the wilderness from the day that thou didst depart out of 
the land of egypt until ye came unto this place ye have been 
rebellious against the lord 
also in horeb ye provoked the lord to wrath so that the lord was 
angry with you to have destroyed you 
when i was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone 
even the tables of the covenant which the lord made with you then i 
abode in the mount forty days and forty nights i neither did eat 
bread nor drink water and the lord delivered unto me two tables 
of stone written with the finger of god and on them was written 
according to all the words which the lord spake with you in the mount 
out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly 
and it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights 
that the lord gave me the two tables of stone even the tables of the 
covenant 
and the lord said unto me arise get thee down quickly from 
hence for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of egypt have 
corrupted themselves they are quickly turned aside out of the way 
which i commanded them they have made them a molten image 
furthermore the lord spake unto me saying i have seen this 
people and behold it is a stiffnecked people let me alone 
that i may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven 
and i will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they 
so i turned and came down from the mount and the mount burned 
with fire and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands 
and i looked and behold ye had sinned against the lord your 
god and had made you a molten calf ye had turned aside quickly out 
of the way which the lord had commanded you 
and i took the two tables and cast them out of my two hands and 
brake them before your eyes 
and i fell down before the lord as at the first forty days and 
forty nights i did neither eat bread nor drink water because of all 
your sins which ye sinned in doing wickedly in the sight of the lord 
to provoke him to anger 
for i was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure wherewith the 
lord was wroth against you to destroy you but the lord hearkened unto 
me at that time also 
and the lord was very angry with aaron to have destroyed him and 
i prayed for aaron also the same time 
and i took your sin the calf which ye had made and burnt it 
with fire and stamped it and ground it very small even until it was 
as small as dust and i cast the dust thereof into the brook that 
descended out of the mount 
and at taberah and at massah and at kibrothhattaavah ye 
provoked the lord to wrath 
likewise when the lord sent you from kadeshbarnea saying go up 
and possess the land which i have given you then ye rebelled against 
the commandment of the lord your god and ye believed him not nor 
hearkened to his voice 
ye have been rebellious against the lord from the day that i knew 
you 
thus i fell down before the lord forty days and forty nights as 
i fell down at the first because the lord had said he would destroy 
you 
i prayed therefore unto the lord and said o lord god destroy 
not thy people and thine inheritance which thou hast redeemed through 
thy greatness which thou hast brought forth out of egypt with a 
mighty hand 
remember thy servants abraham isaac and jacob look not unto 
the stubbornness of this people nor to their wickedness nor to their 
sin lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say because the 
lord was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them 
and because he hated them he hath brought them out to slay them in 
the wilderness 
yet they are thy people and thine inheritance which thou 
broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm 
at that time the lord said unto me hew thee two tables of stone 
like unto the first and come up unto me into the mount and make thee 
an ark of wood 
and i will write on the tables the words that were in the first 
tables which thou brakest and thou shalt put them in the ark 
and i made an ark of shittim wood and hewed two tables of stone 
like unto the first and went up into the mount having the two tables 
in mine hand 
and he wrote on the tables according to the first writing the 
ten commandments which the lord spake unto you in the mount out of 
the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly and the lord gave 
them unto me 
and i turned myself and came down from the mount and put the 
tables in the ark which i had made and there they be as the lord 
commanded me 
and the children of israel took their journey from beeroth of the 
children of jaakan to mosera there aaron died and there he was 
buried and eleazar his son ministered in the priest s office in his 
stead 
from thence they journeyed unto gudgodah and from gudgodah to 
jotbath a land of rivers of waters 
at that time the lord separated the tribe of levi to bear the 
ark of the covenant of the lord to stand before the lord to minister 
unto him and to bless in his name unto this day 
wherefore levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren 
the lord is his inheritance according as the lord thy god promised 
him 
and i stayed in the mount according to the first time forty 
days and forty nights and the lord hearkened unto me at that time 
also and the lord would not destroy thee 
and the lord said unto me arise take thy journey before the 
people that they may go in and possess the land which i sware unto 
their fathers to give unto them 
and now israel what doth the lord thy god require of thee but 
to fear the lord thy god to walk in all his ways and to love him 
and to serve the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy 
soul to keep the commandments of the lord and his statutes 
which i command thee this day for thy good behold the heaven 
and the heaven of heavens is the lord s thy god the earth also with 
all that therein is 
only the lord had a delight in thy fathers to love them and he 
chose their seed after them even you above all people as it is this 
day 
circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart and be no more 
stiffnecked 
for the lord your god is god of gods and lord of lords a great 
god a mighty and a terrible which regardeth not persons nor taketh 
reward he doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and 
widow and loveth the stranger in giving him food and raiment 
love ye therefore the stranger for ye were strangers in the 
land of egypt 
thou shalt fear the lord thy god him shalt thou serve and to 
him shalt thou cleave and swear by his name 
he is thy praise and he is thy god that hath done for thee 
these great and terrible things which thine eyes have seen 
thy fathers went down into egypt with threescore and ten 
persons and now the lord thy god hath made thee as the stars of 
heaven for multitude 
therefore thou shalt love the lord thy god and keep his charge 
and his statutes and his judgments and his commandments alway 
and know ye this day for i speak not with your children which 
have not known and which have not seen the chastisement of the lord 
your god his greatness his mighty hand and his stretched out arm 
and his miracles and his acts which he did in the midst of 
egypt unto pharaoh the king of egypt and unto all his land and 
what he did unto the army of egypt unto their horses and to their 
chariots how he made the water of the red sea to overflow them as 
they pursued after you and how the lord hath destroyed them unto this 
day and what he did unto you in the wilderness until ye came 
into this place and what he did unto dathan and abiram the sons 
of eliab the son of reuben how the earth opened her mouth and 
swallowed them up and their households and their tents and all the 
substance that was in their possession in the midst of all israel 
but your eyes have seen all the great acts of the lord which he 
did 
therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which i command you 
this day that ye may be strong and go in and possess the land 
whither ye go to possess it and that ye may prolong your days in 
the land which the lord sware unto your fathers to give unto them and 
to their seed a land that floweth with milk and honey 
for the land whither thou goest in to possess it is not as the 
land of egypt from whence ye came out where thou sowedst thy seed 
and wateredst it with thy foot as a garden of herbs but the 
land whither ye go to possess it is a land of hills and valleys and 
drinketh water of the rain of heaven a land which the lord thy 
god careth for the eyes of the lord thy god are always upon it from 
the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year 
and it shall come to pass if ye shall hearken diligently unto 
my commandments which i command you this day to love the lord your 
god and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul 
that i will give you the rain of your land in his due season 
the first rain and the latter rain that thou mayest gather in thy 
corn and thy wine and thine oil 
and i will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle that thou 
mayest eat and be full 
take heed to yourselves that your heart be not deceived and ye 
turn aside and serve other gods and worship them and then the 
lord s wrath be kindled against you and he shut up the heaven that 
there be no rain and that the land yield not her fruit and lest ye 
perish quickly from off the good land which the lord giveth you 
therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in 
your soul and bind them for a sign upon your hand that they may be 
as frontlets between your eyes 
and ye shall teach them your children speaking of them when 
thou sittest in thine house and when thou walkest by the way when 
thou liest down and when thou risest up 
and thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house 
and upon thy gates that your days may be multiplied and the 
days of your children in the land which the lord sware unto your 
fathers to give them as the days of heaven upon the earth 
for if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which i 
command you to do them to love the lord your god to walk in all his 
ways and to cleave unto him then will the lord drive out all 
these nations from before you and ye shall possess greater nations 
and mightier than yourselves 
every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be 
yours from the wilderness and lebanon from the river the river 
euphrates even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be 
there shall no man be able to stand before you for the lord 
your god shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the 
land that ye shall tread upon as he hath said unto you 
behold i set before you this day a blessing and a curse 
a blessing if ye obey the commandments of the lord your god which i 
command you this day and a curse if ye will not obey the 
commandments of the lord your god but turn aside out of the way which 
i command you this day to go after other gods which ye have not 
known 
and it shall come to pass when the lord thy god hath brought 
thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it that thou 
shalt put the blessing upon mount gerizim and the curse upon mount 
ebal 
are they not on the other side jordan by the way where the sun 
goeth down in the land of the canaanites which dwell in the 
champaign over against gilgal beside the plains of moreh for 
ye shall pass over jordan to go in to possess the land which the lord 
your god giveth you and ye shall possess it and dwell therein 
and ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which 
i set before you this day 
these are the statutes and judgments which ye shall observe to 
do in the land which the lord god of thy fathers giveth thee to 
possess it all the days that ye live upon the earth 
ye shall utterly destroy all the places wherein the nations 
which ye shall possess served their gods upon the high mountains and 
upon the hills and under every green tree and ye shall 
overthrow their altars and break their pillars and burn their groves 
with fire and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods and 
destroy the names of them out of that place 
ye shall not do so unto the lord your god 
but unto the place which the lord your god shall choose out of 
all your tribes to put his name there even unto his habitation shall 
ye seek and thither thou shalt come and thither ye shall bring 
your burnt offerings and your sacrifices and your tithes and heave 
offerings of your hand and your vows and your freewill offerings 
and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks and there ye 
shall eat before the lord your god and ye shall rejoice in all that 
ye put your hand unto ye and your households wherein the lord thy 
god hath blessed thee 
ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day 
every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes 
for ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance 
which the lord your god giveth you 
but when ye go over jordan and dwell in the land which the lord 
your god giveth you to inherit and when he giveth you rest from all 
your enemies round about so that ye dwell in safety then there 
shall be a place which the lord your god shall choose to cause his 
name to dwell there thither shall ye bring all that i command you 
your burnt offerings and your sacrifices your tithes and the heave 
offering of your hand and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the 
lord and ye shall rejoice before the lord your god ye and 
your sons and your daughters and your menservants and your 
maidservants and the levite that is within your gates forasmuch as 
he hath no part nor inheritance with you 
take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in 
every place that thou seest but in the place which the lord 
shall choose in one of thy tribes there thou shalt offer thy burnt 
offerings and there thou shalt do all that i command thee 
notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates 
whatsoever thy soul lusteth after according to the blessing of the 
lord thy god which he hath given thee the unclean and the clean may 
eat thereof as of the roebuck and as of the hart 
only ye shall not eat the blood ye shall pour it upon the earth 
as water 
thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn or 
of thy wine or of thy oil or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy 
flock nor any of thy vows which thou vowest nor thy freewill 
offerings or heave offering of thine hand but thou must eat 
them before the lord thy god in the place which the lord thy god shall 
choose thou and thy son and thy daughter and thy manservant and 
thy maidservant and the levite that is within thy gates and thou 
shalt rejoice before the lord thy god in all that thou puttest thine 
hands unto 
take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the levite as long as 
thou livest upon the earth 
when the lord thy god shall enlarge thy border as he hath 
promised thee and thou shalt say i will eat flesh because thy soul 
longeth to eat flesh thou mayest eat flesh whatsoever thy soul 
lusteth after 
if the place which the lord thy god hath chosen to put his name 
there be too far from thee then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of 
thy flock which the lord hath given thee as i have commanded thee 
and thou shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after 
even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten so thou shalt eat 
them the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike 
only be sure that thou eat not the blood for the blood is the 
life and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh 
thou shalt not eat it thou shalt pour it upon the earth as 
water 
thou shalt not eat it that it may go well with thee and with 
thy children after thee when thou shalt do that which is right in the 
sight of the lord 
only thy holy things which thou hast and thy vows thou shalt 
take and go unto the place which the lord shall choose and 
thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings the flesh and the blood upon 
the altar of the lord thy god and the blood of thy sacrifices shall 
be poured out upon the altar of the lord thy god and thou shalt eat 
the flesh 
observe and hear all these words which i command thee that it 
may go well with thee and with thy children after thee for ever when 
thou doest that which is good and right in the sight of the lord thy 
god 
when the lord thy god shall cut off the nations from before 
thee whither thou goest to possess them and thou succeedest them 
and dwellest in their land take heed to thyself that thou be 
not snared by following them after that they be destroyed from before 
thee and that thou enquire not after their gods saying how did 
these nations serve their gods even so will i do likewise 
thou shalt not do so unto the lord thy god for every 
abomination to the lord which he hateth have they done unto their 
gods for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the 
fire to their gods 
what thing soever i command you observe to do it thou shalt 
not add thereto nor diminish from it 
if there arise among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams and 
giveth thee a sign or a wonder and the sign or the wonder come 
to pass whereof he spake unto thee saying let us go after other 
gods which thou hast not known and let us serve them thou 
shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet or that dreamer of 
dreams for the lord your god proveth you to know whether ye love the 
lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul 
ye shall walk after the lord your god and fear him and keep his 
commandments and obey his voice and ye shall serve him and cleave 
unto him 
and that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to 
death because he hath spoken to turn you away from the lord your god 
which brought you out of the land of egypt and redeemed you out of 
the house of bondage to thrust thee out of the way which the lord thy 
god commanded thee to walk in so shalt thou put the evil away from 
the midst of thee 
if thy brother the son of thy mother or thy son or thy 
daughter or the wife of thy bosom or thy friend which is as thine 
own soul entice thee secretly saying let us go and serve other 
gods which thou hast not known thou nor thy fathers namely 
of the gods of the people which are round about you nigh unto thee 
or far off from thee from the one end of the earth even unto the 
other end of the earth thou shalt not consent unto him nor 
hearken unto him neither shall thine eye pity him neither shalt thou 
spare neither shalt thou conceal him but thou shalt surely kill 
him thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death and 
afterwards the hand of all the people 
and thou shalt stone him with stones that he die because he 
hath sought to thrust thee away from the lord thy god which brought 
thee out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage 
and all israel shall hear and fear and shall do no more any 
such wickedness as this is among you 
if thou shalt hear say in one of thy cities which the lord thy 
god hath given thee to dwell there saying certain men the 
children of belial are gone out from among you and have withdrawn 
the inhabitants of their city saying let us go and serve other gods 
which ye have not known then shalt thou enquire and make 
search and ask diligently and behold if it be truth and the thing 
certain that such abomination is wrought among you thou shalt 
surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword 
destroying it utterly and all that is therein and the cattle 
thereof with the edge of the sword 
and thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the 
street thereof and shalt burn with fire the city and all the spoil 
thereof every whit for the lord thy god and it shall be an heap for 
ever it shall not be built again 
and there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand 
that the lord may turn from the fierceness of his anger and shew thee 
mercy and have compassion upon thee and multiply thee as he hath 
sworn unto thy fathers when thou shalt hearken to the voice of 
the lord thy god to keep all his commandments which i command thee 
this day to do that which is right in the eyes of the lord thy god 
ye are the children of the lord your god ye shall not cut 
yourselves nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead 
for thou art an holy people unto the lord thy god and the lord 
hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself above all the 
nations that are upon the earth 
thou shalt not eat any abominable thing 
these are the beasts which ye shall eat the ox the sheep and 
the goat the hart and the roebuck and the fallow deer and the 
wild goat and the pygarg and the wild ox and the chamois 
and every beast that parteth the hoof and cleaveth the cleft 
into two claws and cheweth the cud among the beasts that ye shall 
eat 
nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud or 
of them that divide the cloven hoof as the camel and the hare and 
the coney for they chew the cud but divide not the hoof therefore 
they are unclean unto you

vulture after his kind and every raven after his kind 
and the owl and the night hawk and the cuckow and the hawk after 
his kind the little owl and the great owl and the swan 
and the pelican and the gier eagle and the cormorant and the 
stork and the heron after her kind and the lapwing and the bat 
and every creeping thing that flieth is unclean unto you they 
shall not be eaten 
but of all clean fowls ye may eat

give it unto the stranger that is in thy gates that he may eat it or

the lord thy god

field bringeth forth year by year 
and thou shalt eat before the lord thy god in the place which 
he shall choose to place his name there the tithe of thy corn of thy 
wine and of thine oil and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy 
flocks that thou mayest learn to fear the lord thy god always 
and if the way be too long for thee so that thou art not able 
to carry it or if the place be too far from thee which the lord thy 
god shall choose to set his name there when the lord thy god hath 
blessed thee then shalt thou turn it into money and bind up 
the money in thine hand and shalt go unto the place which the lord 
thy god shall choose and thou shalt bestow that money for 
whatsoever thy soul lusteth after for oxen or for sheep or for 
wine or for strong drink or for whatsoever thy soul desireth and 
thou shalt eat there before the lord thy god and thou shalt rejoice 
thou and thine household and the levite that is within thy 
gates thou shalt not forsake him for he hath no part nor inheritance 
with thee 
at the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe 
of thine increase the same year and shalt lay it up within thy gates

thee and the stranger and the fatherless and the widow which are 
within thy gates shall come and shall eat and be satisfied that the 
lord thy god may bless thee in all the work of thine hand which thou 
doest 
at the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release 
and this is the manner of the release every creditor that 
lendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release it he shall not exact 
it of his neighbour or of his brother because it is called the 
lord s release 
of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again but that which is 
thine with thy brother thine hand shall release save when there 
shall be no poor among you for the lord shall greatly bless thee in 
the land which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance to 
possess it only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the 
lord thy god to observe to do all these commandments which i command 
thee this day 
for the lord thy god blesseth thee as he promised thee and thou 
shalt lend unto many nations but thou shalt not borrow and thou 
shalt reign over many nations but they shall not reign over thee 
if there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within 
any of thy gates in thy land which the lord thy god giveth thee thou 
shalt not harden thine heart nor shut thine hand from thy poor 
brother but thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him and shalt 
surely lend him sufficient for his need in that which he wanteth 
beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart saying 
the seventh year the year of release is at hand and thine eye be 
evil against thy poor brother and thou givest him nought and he cry 
unto the lord against thee and it be sin unto thee

when thou givest unto him because that for this thing the lord thy 
god shall bless thee in all thy works and in all that thou puttest 
thine hand unto 
for the poor shall never cease out of the land therefore i 
command thee saying thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy 
brother to thy poor and to thy needy in thy land 
and if thy brother an hebrew man or an hebrew woman be sold 
unto thee and serve thee six years then in the seventh year thou 
shalt let him go free from thee 
and when thou sendest him out free from thee thou shalt not let 
him go away empty thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy 
flock and out of thy floor and out of thy winepress of that 
wherewith the lord thy god hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him 
and thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of 
egypt and the lord thy god redeemed thee therefore i command thee 
this thing to day 
and it shall be if he say unto thee i will not go away from 
thee because he loveth thee and thine house because he is well with 
thee then thou shalt take an aul and thrust it through his ear 
unto the door and he shall be thy servant for ever and also unto thy 
maidservant thou shalt do likewise 
it shall not seem hard unto thee when thou sendest him away 
free from thee for he hath been worth a double hired servant to thee 
in serving thee six years and the lord thy god shall bless thee in 
all that thou doest

thou shalt sanctify unto the lord thy god thou shalt do no work with 
the firstling of thy bullock nor shear the firstling of thy sheep

choose to place his name there

and there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy 
coast seven days neither shall there any thing of the flesh which 
thou sacrificedst the first day at even remain all night until the

thy god in the place which he shall choose in the feast of unleavened 
bread and in the feast of weeks and in the feast of tabernacles and

give as he is able according to the blessing of the lord thy god 
which he hath given thee

altar of the lord thy god which thou shalt make thee 
neither shalt thou set thee up any image which the lord thy god 
hateth

sheep wherein is blemish or any evilfavouredness for that is an 
abomination unto the lord thy god 
if there be found among you within any of thy gates which the 
lord thy god giveth thee man or woman that hath wrought wickedness 
in the sight of the lord thy god in transgressing his covenant 
and hath gone and served other gods and worshipped them either the 
sun or moon or any of the host of heaven which i have not 
commanded and it be told thee and thou hast heard of it and 
enquired diligently and behold it be true and the thing certain 
that such abomination is wrought in israel then shalt thou bring 
forth that man or that woman which have committed that wicked thing 
unto thy gates even that man or that woman and shalt stone them with 
stones till they die 
at the mouth of two witnesses or three witnesses shall he that 
is worthy of death be put to death but at the mouth of one witness he 
shall not be put to death

death and afterward the hands of all the people so thou shalt put 
the evil away from among you 
if there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment between 
blood and blood between plea and plea and between stroke and stroke 
being matters of controversy within thy gates then shalt thou arise 
and get thee up into the place which the lord thy god shall choose 
and thou shalt come unto the priests the levites and unto the 
judge that shall be in those days and enquire and they shall shew 
thee the sentence of judgment and thou shalt do according to 
the sentence which they of that place which the lord shall choose 
shall shew thee and thou shalt observe to do according to all that 
they inform thee according to the sentence of the law which 
they shall teach thee and according to the judgment which they shall 
tell thee thou shalt do thou shalt not decline from the sentence 
which they shall shew thee to the right hand nor to the left 
and the man that will do presumptuously and will not hearken 
unto the priest that standeth to minister there before the lord thy 
god or unto the judge even that man shall die and thou shalt put 
away the evil from israel 
and all the people shall hear and fear and do no more 
presumptuously 
when thou art come unto the land which the lord thy god giveth 
thee and shalt possess it and shalt dwell therein and shalt say i 
will set a king over me like as all the nations that are about me

god shall choose one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over 
thee thou mayest not set a stranger over thee which is not thy 
brother 
but he shall not multiply horses to himself nor because the 
people to return to egypt to the end that he should multiply horses 
forasmuch as the lord hath said unto you ye shall henceforth return 
no more that way 
neither shall he multiply wives to himself that his heart turn 
not away neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and 
gold 
and it shall be when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom 
that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which 
is before the priests the levites and it shall be with him and 
he shall read therein all the days of his life that he may learn to 
fear the lord his god to keep all the words of this law and these 
statutes to do them that his heart be not lifted up above his 
brethren and that he turn not aside from the commandment to the 
right hand or to the left to the end that he may prolong his days in 
his kingdom he and his children in the midst of israel 
the priests the levites and all the tribe of levi shall have no 
part nor inheritance with israel they shall eat the offerings of the 
lord made by fire and his inheritance 
therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren 
the lord is their inheritance as he hath said unto them 
and this shall be the priest s due from the people from them 
that offer a sacrifice whether it be ox or sheep and they shall give 
unto the priest the shoulder and the two cheeks and the maw 
the firstfruit also of thy corn of thy wine and of thine oil 
and the first of the fleece of thy sheep shalt thou give him 
for the lord thy god hath chosen him out of all thy tribes to 
stand to minister in the name of the lord him and his sons for ever 
and if a levite come from any of thy gates out of all israel 
where he sojourned and come with all the desire of his mind unto the 
place which the lord shall choose then he shall minister in the 
name of the lord his god as all his brethren the levites do which 
stand there before the lord 
they shall have like portions to eat beside that which cometh of 
the sale of his patrimony 
when thou art come into the land which the lord thy god giveth 
thee thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those 
nations 
there shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son 
or his daughter to pass through the fire or that useth divination or 
an observer of times or an enchanter or a witch 
or a charmer or a consulter with familiar spirits or a wizard 
or a necromancer 
for all that do these things are an abomination unto the lord 
and because of these abominations the lord thy god doth drive them out 
from before thee 
thou shalt be perfect with the lord thy god 
for these nations which thou shalt possess hearkened unto 
observers of times and unto diviners but as for thee the lord thy 
god hath not suffered thee so to do 
the lord thy god will raise up unto thee a prophet from the 
midst of thee of thy brethren like unto me unto him ye shall 
hearken according to all that thou desiredst of the lord thy 
god in horeb in the day of the assembly saying let me not hear again 
the voice of the lord my god neither let me see this great fire any 
more that i die not 
and the lord said unto me they have well spoken that which they 
have spoken 
i will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren like 
unto thee and will put my words in his mouth and he shall speak unto 
them all that i shall command him 
and it shall come to pass that whosoever will not hearken unto 
my words which he shall speak in my name i will require it of him 
but the prophet which shall presume to speak a word in my name 
which i have not commanded him to speak or that shall speak in the 
name of other gods even that prophet shall die 
and if thou say in thine heart how shall we know the word which 
the lord hath not spoken when a prophet speaketh in the name 
of the lord if the thing follow not nor come to pass that is the 
thing which the lord hath not spoken but the prophet hath spoken it 
presumptuously thou shalt not be afraid of him 
when the lord thy god hath cut off the nations whose land the 
lord thy god giveth thee and thou succeedest them and dwellest in 
their cities and in their houses thou shalt separate three 
cities for thee in the midst of thy land which the lord thy god 
giveth thee to possess it 
thou shalt prepare thee a way and divide the coasts of thy land 
which the lord thy god giveth thee to inherit into three parts that 
every slayer may flee thither 
and this is the case of the slayer which shall flee thither 
that he may live whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly whom he 
hated not in time past as when a man goeth into the wood with 
his neighbour to hew wood and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe 
to cut down the tree and the head slippeth from the helve and 
lighteth upon his neighbour that he die he shall flee unto one of 
those cities and live lest the avenger of the blood pursue the 
slayer while his heart is hot and overtake him because the way is 
long and slay him whereas he was not worthy of death inasmuch as he 
hated him not in time past 
wherefore i command thee saying thou shalt separate three 
cities for thee 
and if the lord thy god enlarge thy coast as he hath sworn unto 
thy fathers and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto 
thy fathers if thou shalt keep all these commandments to do 
them which i command thee this day to love the lord thy god and to 
walk ever in his ways then shalt thou add three cities more for thee 
beside these three that innocent blood be not she would in thy land 
which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance and so blood be 
upon thee 
but if any man hate his neighbour and lie in wait for him and 
rise up against him and smite him mortally that he die and fleeth 
into one of these cities then the elders of his city shall send 
and fetch him thence and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of 
blood that he may die 
thine eye shall not pity him but thou shalt put away the guilt 
of innocent blood from israel that it may go well with thee 
thou shalt not remove thy neighbour s landmark which they of 
old time have set in thine inheritance which thou shalt inherit in 
the land that the lord thy god giveth thee to possess it 
one witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity or 
for any sin in any sin that he sinneth at the mouth of two 
witnesses or at the mouth of three witnesses shall the matter be 
established 
if a false witness rise up against any man to testify against 
him that which is wrong then both the men between whom the 
controversy is shall stand before the lord before the priests and 
the judges which shall be in those days and the judges shall 
make diligent inquisition and behold if the witness be a false 
witness and hath testified falsely against his brother then 
shall ye do unto him as he had thought to have done unto his brother 
so shalt thou put the evil away from among you 
and those which remain shall hear and fear and shall 
henceforth commit no more any such evil among you 
and thine eye shall not pity but life shall go for life eye 
for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot 
when thou goest out to battle against thine enemies and seest 
horses and chariots and a people more than thou be not afraid of 
them for the lord thy god is with thee which brought thee up out of 
the land of egypt 
and it shall be when ye are come nigh unto the battle that the 
priest shall approach and speak unto the people and shall say 
unto them hear o israel ye approach this day unto battle against 
your enemies let not your hearts faint fear not and do not tremble 
neither be ye terrified because of them for the lord your god is 
he that goeth with you to fight for you against your enemies to save 
you 
and the officers shall speak unto the people saying what man is 
there that hath built a new house and hath not dedicated it let him 
go and return to his house lest he die in the battle and another man 
dedicate it 
and what man is he that hath planted a vineyard and hath not yet 
eaten of it let him also go and return unto his house lest he die in 
the battle and another man eat of it 
and what man is there that hath betrothed a wife and hath not 
taken her let him go and return unto his house lest he die in the 
battle and another man take her 
and the officers shall speak further unto the people and they 
shall say what man is there that is fearful and fainthearted let him 
go and return unto his house lest his brethren s heart faint as well 
as his heart 
and it shall be when the officers have made an end of speaking 
unto the people that they shall make captains of the armies to lead 
the people 
when thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it then 
proclaim peace unto it 
and it shall be if it make thee answer of peace and open unto 
thee then it shall be that all the people that is found therein 
shall be tributaries unto thee and they shall serve thee 
and if it will make no peace with thee but will make war 
against thee then thou shalt besiege it and when the lord thy 
god hath delivered it into thine hands thou shalt smite every male 
thereof with the edge of the sword but the women and the 
little ones and the cattle and all that is in the city even all the 
spoil thereof shalt thou take unto thyself and thou shalt eat the 
spoil of thine enemies which the lord thy god hath given thee 
thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off 
from thee which are not of the cities of these nations 
but of the cities of these people which the lord thy god doth 
give thee for an inheritance thou shalt save alive nothing that 
breatheth but thou shalt utterly destroy them namely the 
hittites and the amorites the canaanites and the perizzites the 
hivites and the jebusites as the lord thy god hath commanded thee 
that they teach you not to do after all their abominations 
which they have done unto their gods so should ye sin against the 
lord your god 
when thou shalt besiege a city a long time in making war 
against it to take it thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by 
forcing an axe against them for thou mayest eat of them and thou 
shalt not cut them down for the tree of the field is man s life to 
employ them in the siege only the trees which thou knowest that 
they be not trees for meat thou shalt destroy and cut them down and 
thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee 
until it be subdued 
if one be found slain in the land which the lord thy god giveth 
thee to possess it lying in the field and it be not known who hath 
slain him then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth and 
they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is 
slain and it shall be that the city which is next unto the 
slain man even the elders of that city shall take an heifer which 
hath not been wrought with and which hath not drawn in the yoke 
and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough 
valley which is neither eared nor sown and shall strike off the 
heifer s neck there in the valley and the priests the sons of 
levi shall come near for them the lord thy god hath chosen to 
minister unto him and to bless in the name of the lord and by their 
word shall every controversy and every stroke be tried and all 
the elders of that city that are next unto the slain man shall wash 
their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley and 
they shall answer and say our hands have not she would this blood neither 
have our eyes seen it 
be merciful o lord unto thy people israel whom thou hast 
redeemed and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of israel s 
charge and the blood shall be forgiven them 
so shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among 
you when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the lord 
when thou goest forth to war against thine enemies and the lord 
thy god hath delivered them into thine hands and thou hast taken them 
captive and seest among the captives a beautiful woman and 
hast a desire unto her that thou wouldest have her to thy wife 
then thou shalt bring her home to thine house and she shall shave her 
head and pare her nails and she shall put the raiment of her 
captivity from off her and shall remain in thine house and bewail 
her father and her mother a full month and after that thou shalt go 
in unto her and be her husband and she shall be thy wife 
and it shall be if thou have no delight in her then thou shalt 
let her go whither she will but thou shalt not sell her at all for 
money thou shalt not make merchandise of her because thou hast 
humbled her 
if a man have two wives one beloved and another hated and 
they have born him children both the beloved and the hated and if 
the firstborn son be hers that was hated then it shall be when 
he maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath that he may not make 
the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated which is 
indeed the firstborn but he shall acknowledge the son of the 
hated for the firstborn by giving him a double portion of all that he 
hath for he is the beginning of his strength the right of the 
firstborn is his 
if a man have a stubborn and rebellious son which will not obey 
the voice of his father or the voice of his mother and that when 
they have chastened him will not hearken unto them then shall 
his father and his mother lay hold on him and bring him out unto the 
elders of his city and unto the gate of his place and they 
shall say unto the elders of his city this our son is stubborn and 
rebellious he will not obey our voice he is a glutton and a 
drunkard 
and all the men of his city shall stone him with stones that he 
die so shalt thou put evil away from among you and all israel shall 
hear and fear 
and if a man have committed a sin worthy of death and he be to 
be put to death and thou hang him on a tree his body shall not 
remain all night upon the tree but thou shalt in any wise bury him 
that day for he that is hanged is accursed of god that thy land be 
not defiled which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance 
thou shalt not see thy brother s ox or his sheep go astray and 
hide thyself from them thou shalt in any case bring them again unto 
thy brother 
and if thy brother be not nigh unto thee or if thou know him 
not then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house and it shall be 
with thee until thy brother seek after it and thou shalt restore it 
to him again 
in like manner shalt thou do with his ass and so shalt thou do 
with his raiment and with all lost thing of thy brother s which he 
hath lost and thou hast found shalt thou do likewise thou mayest 
not hide thyself 
thou shalt not see thy brother s ass or his ox fall down by the 
way and hide thyself from them thou shalt surely help him to lift 
them up again 
the woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man 
neither shall a man put on a woman s garment for all that do so are 
abomination unto the lord thy god 
if a bird s nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree 
or on the ground whether they be young ones or eggs and the dam 
sitting upon the young or upon the eggs thou shalt not take the dam 
with the young but thou shalt in any wise let the dam go and 
take the young to thee that it may be well with thee and that thou 
mayest prolong thy days 
when thou buildest a new house then thou shalt make a battlement 
for thy roof that thou bring not blood upon thine house if any man 
fall from thence 
thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds lest the fruit 
of thy seed which thou hast sown and the fruit of thy vineyard be 
defiled 
thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together 
thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts as of woollen and 
linen together 
thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four quarters of thy 
vesture wherewith thou coverest thyself 
if any man take a wife and go in unto her and hate her 
and give occasions of speech against her and bring up an evil name 
upon her and say i took this woman and when i came to her i found 
her not a maid then shall the father of the damsel and her 
mother take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel s virginity unto 
the elders of the city in the gate and the damsel s father 
shall say unto the elders i gave my daughter unto this man to wife 
and he hateth her and lo he hath given occasions of speech 
against her saying i found not thy daughter a maid and yet these 
are the tokens of my daughter s virginity and they shall spread the 
cloth before the elders of the city 
and the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise 
him and they shall amerce him in an hundred shekels of silver 
and give them unto the father of the damsel because he hath brought 
up an evil name upon a virgin of israel and she shall be his wife he 
may not put her away all his days 
but if this thing be true and the tokens of virginity be not 
found for the damsel then they shall bring out the damsel to 
the door of her father s house and the men of her city shall stone 
her with stones that she die because she hath wrought folly in 
israel to play the whore in her father s house so shalt thou put 
evil away from among you 
if a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband then 
they shall both of them die both the man that lay with the woman and 
the woman so shalt thou put away evil from israel 
if a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband and a 
man find her in the city and lie with her then ye shall bring 
them both out unto the gate of that city and ye shall stone them with 
stones that they die the damsel because she cried not being in the 
city and the man because he hath humbled his neighbour s wife so 
thou shalt put away evil from among you 
but if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field and the man 
force her and lie with her then the man only that lay with her shall 
die 
but unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing there is in the 
damsel no sin worthy of death for as when a man riseth against his 
neighbour and slayeth him even so is this matter for he found 
her in the field and the betrothed damsel cried and there was none 
to save her 
if a man find a damsel that is a virgin which is not betrothed 
and lay hold on her and lie with her and they be found then

because they hired against thee balaam the son of beor of pethor of 
mesopotamia to curse thee 
nevertheless the lord thy god would not hearken unto balaam but 
the lord thy god turned the curse into a blessing unto thee because 
the lord thy god loved thee

for ever

sun is down he shall come into the camp again 
thou shalt have a place also without the camp whither thou 
shalt go forth abroad and thou shalt have a paddle upon thy 
weapon and it shall be when thou wilt ease thyself abroad thou 
shalt dig therewith and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh 
from thee for the lord thy god walketh in the midst of thy 
camp to deliver thee and to give up thine enemies before thee

thee and turn away from thee

shalt not lend upon usury that the lord thy god may bless thee in all 
that thou settest thine hand to in the land whither thou goest to 
possess it 
when thou shalt vow a vow unto the lord thy god thou shalt not 
slack to pay it for the lord thy god will surely require it of thee 
and it would be sin in thee 
but if thou shalt forbear to vow it shall be no sin in thee

divorcement and giveth it in her hand and sendeth her out of his 
house or if the latter husband die which took her to be his wife

remember that thou wast a bondman in egypt and the lord thy god 
redeemed thee thence therefore i command thee to do this thing

when thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard thou shalt not 
glean it afterward it shall be for the stranger for the fatherless 
and for the widow 
and thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of 
egypt therefore i command thee to do this thing 
if there be a controversy between men and they come unto 
judgment that the judges may judge them then they shall justify the 
righteous and condemn the wicked 
and it shall be if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten that 
the judge shall cause him to lie down and to be beaten before his 
face according to his fault by a certain number 
forty stripes he may give him and not exceed lest if he should 
exceed and beat him above these with many stripes then thy brother

secrets then thou shalt cut off her hand thine eye shall not 
pity her 
thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights a great and a 
small

a small 
but thou shalt have a perfect and just weight a perfect and 
just measure shalt thou have that thy days may be lengthened in the 
land which the lord thy god giveth thee

remember what amalek did unto thee by the way when ye were come 
forth out of egypt how he met thee by the way and smote the 
hindmost of thee even all that were feeble behind thee when thou 
wast faint and weary and he feared not god 
therefore it shall be when the lord thy god hath given thee

thy god giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it that thou shalt 
blot out the remembrance of amalek from under heaven thou shalt not 
forget it 
and it shall be when thou art come in unto the land which the 
lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance and possessest it and 
dwellest therein that thou shalt take of the first of all the 
fruit of the earth which thou shalt bring of thy land that the lord 
thy god giveth thee and shalt put it in a basket and shalt go unto 
the place which the lord thy god shall choose to place his name there 
and thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days 
and say unto him i profess this day unto the lord thy god that i am 
come unto the country which the lord sware unto our fathers for to 
give us 
and the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand and set 
it down before the altar of the lord thy god 
and thou shalt speak and say before the lord thy god a syrian 
ready to perish was my father and he went down into egypt and 
sojourned there with a few and became there a nation great mighty 
and populous and the egyptians evil entreated us and afflicted 
us and laid upon us hard bondage and when we cried unto the 
lord god of our fathers the lord heard our voice and looked on our 
affliction and our labour and our oppression and the lord 
brought us forth out of egypt with a mighty hand and with an 
outstretched arm and with great terribleness and with signs and 
with wonders and he hath brought us into this place and hath 
given us this land even a land that floweth with milk and honey 
and now behold i have brought the firstfruits of the land 
which thou o lord hast given me and thou shalt set it before the 
lord thy god and worship before the lord thy god and thou 
shalt rejoice in every good thing which the lord thy god hath given 
unto thee and unto thine house thou and the levite and the 
stranger that is among you 
when thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine 
increase the third year which is the year of tithing and hast given 
it unto the levite the stranger the fatherless and the widow that 
they may eat within thy gates and be filled then thou shalt 
say before the lord thy god i have brought away the hallowed things 
out of mine house and also have given them unto the levite and unto 
the stranger to the fatherless and to the widow according to all 
thy commandments which thou hast commanded me i have not transgressed 
thy commandments neither have i forgotten them 
i have not eaten thereof in my mourning neither have i taken 
away ought thereof for any unclean use nor given ought thereof for 
the dead but i have hearkened to the voice of the lord my god and 
have done according to all that thou hast commanded me 
look down from thy holy habitation from heaven and bless thy 
people israel and the land which thou hast given us as thou swarest 
unto our fathers a land that floweth with milk and honey 
this day the lord thy god hath commanded thee to do these 
statutes and judgments thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all 
thine heart and with all thy soul 
thou hast avouched the lord this day to be thy god and to walk 
in his ways and to keep his statutes and his commandments and his 
judgments and to hearken unto his voice and the lord hath 
avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people as he hath promised 
thee and that thou shouldest keep all his commandments and to 
make thee high above all nations which he hath made in praise and in 
name and in honour and that thou mayest be an holy people unto the 
lord thy god as he hath spoken 
and moses with the elders of israel commanded the people saying 
keep all the commandments which i command you this day 
and it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over jordan unto 
the land which the lord thy god giveth thee that thou shalt set thee 
up great stones and plaister them with plaister and thou shalt 
write upon them all the words of this law when thou art passed over 
that thou mayest go in unto the land which the lord thy god giveth 
thee a land that floweth with milk and honey as the lord god of thy 
fathers hath promised thee 
therefore it shall be when ye be gone over jordan that ye shall 
set up these stones which i command you this day in mount ebal and 
thou shalt plaister them with plaister 
and there shalt thou build an altar unto the lord thy god an 
altar of stones thou shalt not lift up any iron tool upon them

and thou shalt offer burnt offerings thereon unto the lord thy god

very plainly 
and moses and the priests the levites spake unto all israel 
saying take heed and hearken o israel this day thou art become the 
people of the lord thy god 
thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the lord thy god and do 
his commandments and his statutes which i command thee this day 
and moses charged the people the same day saying these 
shall stand upon mount gerizim to bless the people when ye are come 
over jordan simeon and levi and judah and issachar and joseph 
and benjamin and these shall stand upon mount ebal to curse 
reuben gad and asher and zebulun dan and naphtali 
and the levites shall speak and say unto all the men of israel 
with a loud voice cursed be the man that maketh any graven or 
molten image an abomination unto the lord the work of the hands of 
the craftsman and putteth it in a secret place and all the people 
shall answer and say amen

them and all the people shall say amen

the voice of the lord thy god to observe and to do all his

set thee on high above all nations of the earth and all these 
blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee if thou shalt hearken

and the lord shall make thee plenteous in goods in the fruit of 
thy body and in the fruit of thy cattle and in the fruit of thy 
ground in the land which the lord sware unto thy fathers to give 
thee 
the lord shall open unto thee his good treasure the heaven to 
give the rain unto thy land in his season and to bless all the work 
of thine hand and thou shalt lend unto many nations and thou shalt

thou shalt be above only and thou shalt not be beneath if that thou 
hearken unto the commandments of the lord thy god which i command 
thee this day to observe and to do them and thou shalt not go 
aside from any of the words which i command thee this day to the 
right hand or to the left to go after other gods to serve them 
but it shall come to pass if thou wilt not hearken unto the 
voice of the lord thy god to observe to do all his commandments and 
his statutes which i command thee this day that all these curses 
shall come upon thee and overtake thee cursed shalt thou be in 
the city and cursed shalt thou be in the field 
cursed shall be thy basket and thy store

have consumed thee from off the land whither thou goest to possess 
it

emerods and with the scab and with the itch whereof thou canst not 
be healed 
the lord shall smite thee with madness and blindness and

high and thou shalt come down very low 
he shall lend to thee and thou shalt not lend to him he shall

hearkenedst not unto the voice of the lord thy god to keep his 
commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee and they 
shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder and upon thy seed for 
ever 
because thou servedst not the lord thy god with joyfulness and 
with gladness of heart for the abundance of all things 
therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the lord shall send 
against thee in hunger and in thirst and in nakedness and in want 
of all things and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck until he 
have destroyed thee 
the lord shall bring a nation against thee from far from the

and he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle and the fruit of thy 
land until thou be destroyed which also shall not leave thee either

sheep until he have destroyed thee 
and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates until thy high and 
fenced walls come down wherein thou trustedst throughout all thy 
land and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy 
land which the lord thy god hath given thee 
and thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body the flesh of thy 
sons and of thy daughters which the lord thy god hath given thee in 
the siege and in the straitness wherewith thine enemies shall 
distress thee so that the man that is tender among you and 
very delicate his eye shall be evil toward his brother and toward 
the wife of his bosom and toward the remnant of his children which he 
shall leave so that he will not give to any of them of the 
flesh of his children whom he shall eat because he hath nothing left 
him in the siege and in the straitness wherewith thine enemies shall 
distress thee in all thy gates 
the tender and delicate woman among you which would not 
adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness 
and tenderness her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom 
and toward her son and toward her daughter and toward her 
young one that cometh out from between her feet and toward her 
children which she shall bear for she shall eat them for want of all 
things secretly in the siege and straitness wherewith thine enemy 
shall distress thee in thy gates 
if thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that 
are written in this book that thou mayest fear this glorious and 
fearful name the lord thy god then the lord will make thy 
plagues wonderful and the plagues of thy seed even great plagues 
and of long continuance and sore sicknesses and of long continuance 
moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of egypt 
which thou wast afraid of and they shall cleave unto thee 
also every sickness and every plague which is not written in 
the book of this law them will the lord bring upon thee until thou 
be destroyed 
and ye shall be left few in number whereas ye were as the stars 
of heaven for multitude because thou wouldest not obey the voice of 
the lord thy god 
and it shall come to pass that as the lord rejoiced over you to 
do you good and to multiply you so the lord will rejoice over you to 
destroy you and to bring you to nought and ye shall be plucked from 
off the land whither thou goest to possess it 
and the lord shall scatter thee among all people from the one 
end of the earth even unto the other and there thou shalt serve other 
gods which neither thou nor thy fathers have known even wood and 
stone 
and among these nations shalt thou find no ease neither shall 
the sole of thy foot have rest but the lord shall give thee there a 
trembling heart and failing of eyes and sorrow of mind and 
thy life shall hang in doubt before thee and thou shalt fear day and 
night and shalt have none assurance of thy life in the morning 
thou shalt say would god it were even and at even thou shalt say 
would god it were morning for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou 
shalt fear and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see 
and the lord shall bring thee into egypt again with ships by 
the way whereof i spake unto thee thou shalt see it no more again 
and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and 
bondwomen and no man shall buy you 
these are the words of the covenant which the lord commanded 
moses to make with the children of israel in the land of moab beside 
the covenant which he made with them in horeb 
and moses called unto all israel and said unto them ye have 
seen all that the lord did before your eyes in the land of egypt unto 
pharaoh and unto all his servants and unto all his land the 
great temptations which thine eyes have seen the signs and those 
great miracles yet the lord hath not given you an heart to 
perceive and eyes to see and ears to hear unto this day 
and i have led you forty years in the wilderness your clothes 
are not waxen old upon you and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy 
foot 
ye have not eaten bread neither have ye drunk wine or strong 
drink that ye might know that i am the lord your god 
and when ye came unto this place sihon the king of heshbon and 
og the king of bashan came out against us unto battle and we smote 
them and we took their land and gave it for an inheritance unto 
the reubenites and to the gadites and to the half tribe of manasseh 
keep therefore the words of this covenant and do them that ye 
may prosper in all that ye do 
ye stand this day all of you before the lord your god your 
captains of your tribes your elders and your officers with all the 
men of israel your little ones your wives and thy stranger 
that is in thy camp from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy 
water that thou shouldest enter into covenant with the lord thy 
god and into his oath which the lord thy god maketh with thee this 
day that he may establish thee to day for a people unto 
himself and that he may be unto thee a god as he hath said unto 
thee and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers to abraham to isaac and 
to jacob 
neither with you only do i make this covenant and this oath 
but with him that standeth here with us this day before the lord 
our god and also with him that is not here with us this day 
for ye know how we have dwelt in the land of egypt and how we came 
through the nations which ye passed by and ye have seen their 
abominations and their idols wood and stone silver and gold which 
were among them lest there should be among you man or woman 
or family or tribe whose heart turneth away this day from the lord 
our god to go and serve the gods of these nations lest there should 
be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood and it come 
to pass when he heareth the words of this curse that he bless 
himself in his heart saying i shall have peace though i walk in the 
imagination of mine heart to add drunkenness to thirst the 
lord will not spare him but then the anger of the lord and his 
jealousy shall smoke against that man and all the curses that are 
written in this book shall lie upon him and the lord shall blot out 
his name from under heaven 
and the lord shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes 
of israel according to all the curses of the covenant that are 
written in this book of the law so that the generation to come 
of your children that shall rise up after you and the stranger that 
shall come from a far land shall say when they see the plagues of 
that land and the sicknesses which the lord hath laid upon it 
and that the whole land thereof is brimstone and salt and burning 
that it is not sown nor beareth nor any grass groweth therein like 
the overthrow of sodom and gomorrah admah and zeboim which the 
lord overthrew in his anger and in his wrath even all nations 
shall say wherefore hath the lord done thus unto this land what 
meaneth the heat of this great anger then men shall say 
because they have forsaken the covenant of the lord god of their 
fathers which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the 
land of egypt for they went and served other gods and 
worshipped them gods whom they knew not and whom he had not given 
unto them and the anger of the lord was kindled against this 
land to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book 
and the lord rooted them out of their land in anger and in 
wrath and in great indignation and cast them into another land as 
it is this day 
the secret things belong unto the lord our god but those things 
which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever that 
we may do all the words of this law 
and it shall come to pass when all these things are come upon 
thee the blessing and the curse which i have set before thee and 
thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations whither the lord 
thy god hath driven thee and shalt return unto the lord thy god 
and shalt obey his voice according to all that i command thee this 
day thou and thy children with all thine heart and with all thy 
soul that then the lord thy god will turn thy captivity and 
have compassion upon thee and will return and gather thee from all 
the nations whither the lord thy god hath scattered thee 
if any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven 
from thence will the lord thy god gather thee and from thence will he 
fetch thee and the lord thy god will bring thee into the land 
which thy fathers possessed and thou shalt possess it and he will do 
thee good and multiply thee above thy fathers 
and the lord thy god will circumcise thine heart and the heart 
of thy seed to love the lord thy god with all thine heart and with 
all thy soul that thou mayest live 
and the lord thy god will put all these curses upon thine 
enemies and on them that hate thee which persecuted thee 
and thou shalt return and obey the voice of the lord and do all 
his commandments which i command thee this day 
and the lord thy god will make thee plenteous in every work of 
thine hand in the fruit of thy body and in the fruit of thy cattle 
and in the fruit of thy land for good for the lord will again 
rejoice over thee for good as he rejoiced over thy fathers if 
thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god to keep his 
commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the 
law and if thou turn unto the lord thy god with all thine heart and 
with all thy soul 
for this commandment which i command thee this day it is not 
hidden from thee neither is it far off 
it is not in heaven that thou shouldest say who shall go up 
for us to heaven and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do 
it neither is it beyond the sea that thou shouldest say who 
shall go over the sea for us and bring it unto us that we may hear 
it and do it but the word is very nigh unto thee in thy 
mouth and in thy heart that thou mayest do it 
see i have set before thee this day life and good and death 
and evil in that i command thee this day to love the lord thy 
god to walk in his ways and to keep his commandments and his 
statutes and his judgments that thou mayest live and multiply and 
the lord thy god shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to 
possess it 
but if thine heart turn away so that thou wilt not hear but 
shalt be drawn away and worship other gods and serve them i 
denounce unto you this day that ye shall surely perish and that ye 
shall not prolong your days upon the land whither thou passest over 
jordan to go to possess it 
i call heaven and earth to record this day against you that i 
have set before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore 
choose life that both thou and thy seed may live that thou 
mayest love the lord thy god and that thou mayest obey his voice and 
that thou mayest cleave unto him for he is thy life and the length 
of thy days that thou mayest dwell in the land which the lord sware 
unto thy fathers to abraham to isaac and to jacob to give them 
and moses went and spake these words unto all israel 
and he said unto them i am an hundred and twenty years old this 
day i can no more go out and come in also the lord hath said unto 
me thou shalt not go over this jordan 
the lord thy god he will go over before thee and he will 
destroy these nations from before thee and thou shalt possess them 
and joshua he shall go over before thee as the lord hath said 
and the lord shall do unto them as he did to sihon and to og 
kings of the amorites and unto the land of them whom he destroyed 
and the lord shall give them up before your face that ye may do 
unto them according unto all the commandments which i have commanded 
you 
be strong and of a good courage fear not nor be afraid of them 
for the lord thy god he it is that doth go with thee he will not 
fail thee nor forsake thee 
and moses called unto joshua and said unto him in the sight of 
all israel be strong and of a good courage for thou must go with 
this people unto the land which the lord hath sworn unto their fathers 
to give them and thou shalt because them to inherit it 
and the lord he it is that doth go before thee he will be with 
thee he will not fail thee neither forsake thee fear not neither 
be dismayed 
and moses wrote this law and delivered it unto the priests the 
sons of levi which bare the ark of the covenant of the lord and unto 
all the elders of israel 
and moses commanded them saying at the end of every seven 
years in the solemnity of the year of release in the feast of 
tabernacles when all israel is come to appear before the lord 
thy god in the place which he shall choose thou shalt read this law 
before all israel in their hearing 
gather the people together men and women and children and thy 
stranger that is within thy gates that they may hear and that they 
may learn and fear the lord your god and observe to do all the words 
of this law and that their children which have not known any 
thing may hear and learn to fear the lord your god as long as ye 
live in the land whither ye go over jordan to possess it 
and the lord said unto moses behold thy days approach that 
thou must die call joshua and present yourselves in the tabernacle 
of the congregation that i may give him a charge and moses and 
joshua went and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the 
congregation 
and the lord appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud 
and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle 
and the lord said unto moses behold thou shalt sleep with thy 
fathers and this people will rise up and go a whoring after the gods 
of the strangers of the land whither they go to be among them and 
will forsake me and break my covenant which i have made with them 
then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day and i 
will forsake them and i will hide my face from them and they shall 
be devoured and many evils and troubles shall befall them so that 
they will say in that day are not these evils come upon us because 
our god is not among us and i will surely hide my face in that 
day for all the evils which they shall have wrought in that they are 
turned unto other gods 
now therefore write ye this song for you and teach it the 
children of israel put it in their mouths that this song may be a 
witness for me against the children of israel 
for when i shall have brought them into the land which i sware 
unto their fathers that floweth with milk and honey and they shall 
have eaten and filled themselves and waxen fat then will they turn 
unto other gods and serve them and provoke me and break my 
covenant 
and it shall come to pass when many evils and troubles are 
befallen them that this song shall testify against them as a witness 
for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed for i 
know their imagination which they go about even now before i have 
brought them into the land which i sware 
moses therefore wrote this song the same day and taught it the 
children of israel 
and he gave joshua the son of nun a charge and said be strong 
and of a good courage for thou shalt bring the children of israel 
into the land which i sware unto them and i will be with thee 
and it came to pass when moses had made an end of writing the 
words of this law in a book until they were finished that 
moses commanded the levites which bare the ark of the covenant of the 
lord saying take this book of the law and put it in the side 
of the ark of the covenant of the lord your god that it may be there 
for a witness against thee 
for i know thy rebellion and thy stiff neck behold while i am 
yet alive with you this day ye have been rebellious against the lord 
and how much more after my death gather unto me all the elders 
of your tribes and your officers that i may speak these words in 
their ears and call heaven and earth to record against them 
for i know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt 
yourselves and turn aside from the way which i have commanded you 
and evil will befall you in the latter days because ye will do evil 
in the sight of the lord to provoke him to anger through the work of 
your hands 
and moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of israel 
the words of this song until they were ended 
give ear o ye heavens and i will speak and hear o earth the 
words of my mouth 
my doctrine shall drop as the rain my speech shall distil as the 
dew as the small rain upon the tender herb and as the showers upon 
the grass because i will publish the name of the lord ascribe 
ye greatness unto our god 
he is the rock his work is perfect for all his ways are 
judgment a god of truth and without iniquity just and right is he 
they have corrupted themselves their spot is not the spot of his 
children they are a perverse and crooked generation 
do ye thus requite the lord o foolish people and unwise is not 
he thy father that hath bought thee hath he not made thee and 
established thee remember the days of old consider the years 
of many generations ask thy father and he will shew thee thy 
elders and they will tell thee 
when the most high divided to the nations their inheritance when 
he separated the sons of adam he set the bounds of the people 
according to the number of the children of israel 
for the lord s portion is his people jacob is the lot of his 
inheritance 
he found him in a desert land and in the waste howling 
wilderness he led him about he instructed him he kept him as the 
apple of his eye 
as an eagle stirreth up her nest fluttereth over her young 
spreadeth abroad her wings taketh them beareth them on her wings 
so the lord alone did lead him and there was no strange god 
with him 
he made him ride on the high places of the earth that he might 
eat the increase of the fields and he made him to suck honey out of 
the rock and oil out of the flinty rock butter of kine and 
milk of sheep with fat of lambs and rams of the breed of bashan and 
goats with the fat of kidneys of wheat and thou didst drink the pure 
blood of the grape 
but jeshurun waxed fat and kicked thou art waxen fat thou art 
grown thick thou art covered with fatness then he forsook god which 
made him and lightly esteemed the rock of his salvation 
they provoked him to jealousy with strange gods with 
abominations provoked they him to anger 
they sacrificed unto devils not to god to gods whom they knew 
not to new gods that came newly up whom your fathers feared not 
of the rock that begat thee thou art unmindful and hast 
forgotten god that formed thee 
and when the lord saw it he abhorred them because of the 
provoking of his sons and of his daughters 
and he said i will hide my face from them i will see what 
their end shall be for they are a very froward generation children 
in whom is no faith 
they have moved me to jealousy with that which is not god they 
have provoked me to anger with their vanities and i will move them to 
jealousy with those which are not a people i will provoke them to 
anger with a foolish nation 
for a fire is kindled in mine anger and shall burn unto the 
lowest hell and shall consume the earth with her increase and set on 
fire the foundations of the mountains 
i will heap mischiefs upon them i will spend mine arrows upon 
them 
they shall be burnt with hunger and devoured with burning heat 
and with bitter destruction i will also send the teeth of beasts upon 
them with the poison of serpents of the dust 
the sword without and terror within shall destroy both the 
young man and the virgin the suckling also with the man of gray 
hairs 
i said i would scatter them into corners i would make the 
remembrance of them to cease from among men were it not that i 
feared the wrath of the enemy lest their adversaries should behave 
themselves strangely and lest they should say our hand is high and 
the lord hath not done all this 
for they are a nation void of counsel neither is there any 
understanding in them 
o that they were wise that they understood this that they 
would consider their latter end how should one chase a 
thousand and two put ten thousand to flight except their rock had 
sold them and the lord had shut them up for their rock is not 
as our rock even our enemies themselves being judges 
for their vine is of the vine of sodom and of the fields of 
gomorrah their grapes are grapes of gall their clusters are bitter 
their wine is the poison of dragons and the cruel venom of 
asps 
is not this laid up in store with me and sealed up among my 
treasures to me belongeth vengeance and recompence their foot 
shall slide in due time for the day of their calamity is at hand and 
the things that shall come upon them make haste 
for the lord shall judge his people and repent himself for his 
servants when he seeth that their power is gone and there is none 
shut up or left 
and he shall say where are their gods their rock in whom they 
trusted which did eat the fat of their sacrifices and drank 
the wine of their drink offerings let them rise up and help you and 
be your protection 
see now that i even i am he and there is no god with me i 
kill and i make alive i wound and i heal neither is there any that 
can deliver out of my hand 
for i lift up my hand to heaven and say i live for ever 
if i whet my glittering sword and mine hand take hold on 
judgment i will render vengeance to mine enemies and will reward 
them that hate me 
i will make mine arrows drunk with blood and my sword shall 
devour flesh and that with the blood of the slain and of the 
captives from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy 
rejoice o ye nations with his people for he will avenge the 
blood of his servants and will render vengeance to his adversaries 
and will be merciful unto his land and to his people 
and moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears 
of the people he and hoshea the son of nun 
and moses made an end of speaking all these words to all israel 
and he said unto them set your hearts unto all the words which 
i testify among you this day which ye shall command your children to 
observe to do all the words of this law 
for it is not a vain thing for you because it is your life and 
through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land whither ye 
go over jordan to possess it 
and the lord spake unto moses that selfsame day saying 
get thee up into this mountain abarim unto mount nebo which is in 
the land of moab that is over against jericho and behold the land of 
canaan which i give unto the children of israel for a possession 
and die in the mount whither thou goest up and be gathered unto 
thy people as aaron thy brother died in mount hor and was gathered 
unto his people because ye trespassed against me among the 
children of israel at the waters of meribahkadesh in the wilderness 
of zin because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of 
israel 
yet thou shalt see the land before thee but thou shalt not go 
thither unto the land which i give the children of israel 
and this is the blessing wherewith moses the man of god blessed 
the children of israel before his death 
and he said the lord came from sinai and rose up from seir unto 
them he shined forth from mount paran and he came with ten thousands 
of saints from his right hand went a fiery law for them 
yea he loved the people all his saints are in thy hand and 
they sat down at thy feet every one shall receive of thy words 
moses commanded us a law even the inheritance of the 
congregation of jacob 
and he was king in jeshurun when the heads of the people and the 
tribes of israel were gathered together 
let reuben live and not die and let not his men be few 
and this is the blessing of judah and he said hear lord the 
voice of judah and bring him unto his people let his hands be 
sufficient for him and be thou an help to him from his enemies 
and of levi he said let thy thummim and thy urim be with thy 
holy one whom thou didst prove at massah and with whom thou didst 
strive at the waters of meribah who said unto his father and to 
his mother i have not seen him neither did he acknowledge his 
brethren nor knew his own children for they have observed thy word 
and kept thy covenant 
they shall teach jacob thy judgments and israel thy law they 
shall put incense before thee and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine 
altar 
bless lord his substance and accept the work of his hands 
smite through the loins of them that rise against him and of them 
that hate him that they rise not again 
and of benjamin he said the beloved of the lord shall dwell in 
safety by him and the lord shall cover him all the day long and he 
shall dwell between his shoulders 
and of joseph he said blessed of the lord be his land for the 
precious things of heaven for the dew and for the deep that coucheth 
beneath and for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun 
and for the precious things put forth by the moon and for the 
chief things of the ancient mountains and for the precious things of 
the lasting hills and for the precious things of the earth and 
fulness thereof and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush 
let the blessing come upon the head of joseph and upon the top of the 
head of him that was separated from his brethren 
his glory is like the firstling of his bullock and his horns 
are like the horns of unicorns with them he shall push the people 
together to the ends of the earth and they are the ten thousands of 
ephraim and they are the thousands of manasseh 
and of zebulun he said rejoice zebulun in thy going out and 
issachar in thy tents 
they shall call the people unto the mountain there they shall 
offer sacrifices of righteousness for they shall suck of the 
abundance of the seas and of treasures hid in the sand 
and of gad he said blessed be he that enlargeth gad he 
dwelleth as a lion and teareth the arm with the crown of the head 
and he provided the first part for himself because there in a 
portion of the lawgiver was he seated and he came with the heads of 
the people he executed the justice of the lord and his judgments 
with israel 
and of dan he said dan is a lion s whelp he shall leap from 
bashan 
and of naphtali he said o naphtali satisfied with favour and 
full with the blessing of the lord possess thou the west and the 
south 
and of asher he said let asher be blessed with children let 
him be acceptable to his brethren and let him dip his foot in oil 
thy shoes shall be iron and brass and as thy days so shall thy 
strength be 
there is none like unto the god of jeshurun who rideth upon the 
heaven in thy help and in his excellency on the sky 
the eternal god is thy refuge and underneath are the 
everlasting arms and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee 
and shall say destroy them 
israel then shall dwell in safety alone the fountain of jacob 
shall be upon a land of corn and wine also his heavens shall drop 
down dew 
happy art thou o israel who is like unto thee o people saved 
by the lord the shield of thy help and who is the sword of thy 
excellency and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee and thou 
shalt tread upon their high places 
and moses went up from the plains of moab unto the mountain of 
nebo to the top of pisgah that is over against jericho and the lord 
shewed him all the land of gilead unto dan and all naphtali 
and the land of ephraim and manasseh and all the land of judah unto 
the utmost sea and the south and the plain of the valley of 
jericho the city of palm trees unto zoar 
and the lord said unto him this is the land which i sware unto 
abraham unto isaac and unto jacob saying i will give it unto thy 
seed i have caused thee to see it with thine eyes but thou shalt not 
go over thither 
so moses the servant of the lord died there in the land of moab 
according to the word of the lord 
and he buried him in a valley in the land of moab over against 
bethpeor but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day 
and moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died his 
eye was not dim nor his natural force abated 
and the children of israel wept for moses in the plains of moab 
thirty days so the days of weeping and mourning for moses were ended 
and joshua the son of nun was full of the spirit of wisdom for 
moses had laid his hands upon him and the children of israel 
hearkened unto him and did as the lord commanded moses 
and there arose not a prophet since in israel like unto moses 
whom the lord knew face to face in all the signs and the 
wonders which the lord sent him to do in the land of egypt to 
pharaoh and to all his servants and to all his land and in 
all that mighty hand and in all the great terror which moses shewed 
in the sight of all israel 
the book of joshua 
now after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to 
pass that the lord spake unto joshua the son of nun moses minister 
saying moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over 
this jordan thou and all this people unto the land which i do give 
to them even to the children of israel 
every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon that have 
i given unto you as i said unto moses 
from the wilderness and this lebanon even unto the great river 
the river euphrates all the land of the hittites and unto the great 
sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your coast 
there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days 
of thy life as i was with moses so i will be with thee i will not 
fail thee nor forsake thee 
be strong and of a good courage for unto this people shalt thou 
divide for an inheritance the land which i sware unto their fathers 
to give them 
only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe 
to do according to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee 
turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest 
prosper withersoever thou goest 
this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou 
shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do 
according to all that is written therein for then thou shalt make thy 
way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success 
have not i commanded thee be strong and of a good courage be not 
afraid neither be thou dismayed for the lord thy god is with thee 
whithersoever thou goest 
then joshua commanded the officers of the people saying 
pass through the host and command the people saying prepare you 
victuals for within three days ye shall pass over this jordan to go 
in to possess the land which the lord your god giveth you to possess 
it 
and to the reubenites and to the gadites and to half the tribe 
of manasseh spake joshua saying remember the word which moses 
the servant of the lord commanded you saying the lord your god hath 
given you rest and hath given you this land 
your wives your little ones and your cattle shall remain in 
the land which moses gave you on this side jordan but ye shall pass 
before your brethren armed all the mighty men of valour and help 
them until the lord have given your brethren rest as he hath 
given you and they also have possessed the land which the lord your 
god giveth them then ye shall return unto the land of your 
possession and enjoy it which moses the lord s servant gave you on 
this side jordan toward the sunrising 
and they answered joshua saying all that thou commandest us we 
will do and whithersoever thou sendest us we will go 
according as we hearkened unto moses in all things so will we 
hearken unto thee only the lord thy god be with thee as he was with 
moses 
whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment and will 
not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him he shall 
be put to death only be strong and of a good courage 
and joshua the son of nun sent out of shittim two men to spy 
secretly saying go view the land even jericho and they went and 
came into an harlot s house named rahab and lodged there 
and it was told the king of jericho saying behold there came 
men in hither to night of the children of israel to search out the 
country 
and the king of jericho sent unto rahab saying bring forth the 
men that are come to thee which are entered into thine house for 
they be come to search out all the country 
and the woman took the two men and hid them and said thus there 
came men unto me but i wist not whence they were and it came to 
pass about the time of shutting of the gate when it was dark that 
the men went out whither the men went i wot not pursue after them 
quickly for ye shall overtake them 
but she had brought them up to the roof of the house and hid them 
with the stalks of flax which she had laid in order upon the roof 
and the men pursued after them the way to jordan unto the fords 
and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out they shut 
the gate 
and before they were laid down she came up unto them upon the 
roof and she said unto the men i know that the lord hath given 
you the land and that your terror is fallen upon us and that all the 
inhabitants of the land faint because of you 
for we have heard how the lord dried up the water of the red sea 
for you when ye came out of egypt and what ye did unto the two kings 
of the amorites that were on the other side jordan sihon and og 
whom ye utterly destroyed 
and as soon as we had heard these things our hearts did melt 
neither did there remain any more courage in any man because of you 
for the lord your god he is god in heaven above and in earth 
beneath 
now therefore i pray you swear unto me by the lord since i 
have shewed you kindness that ye will also shew kindness unto my 
father s house and give me a true token and that ye will save 
alive my father and my mother and my brethren and my sisters and 
all that they have and deliver our lives from death 
and the men answered her our life for yours if ye utter not 
this our business and it shall be when the lord hath given us the 
land that we will deal kindly and truly with thee 
then she let them down by a cord through the window for her 
house was upon the town wall and she dwelt upon the wall 
and she said unto them get you to the mountain lest the 
pursuers meet you and hide yourselves there three days until the 
pursuers be returned and afterward may ye go your way 
and the men said unto her we will be blameless of this thine 
oath which thou hast made us swear 
behold when we come into the land thou shalt bind this line of 
scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by and thou 
shalt bring thy father and thy mother and thy brethren and all thy 
father s household home unto thee 
and it shall be that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy 
house into the street his blood shall be upon his head and we will 
be guiltless and whosoever shall be with thee in the house his blood 
shall be on our head if any hand be upon him 
and if thou utter this our business then we will be quit of 
thine oath which thou hast made us to swear 
and she said according unto your words so be it and she sent 
them away and they departed and she bound the scarlet line in the 
window 
and they went and came unto the mountain and abode there three 
days until the pursuers were returned and the pursuers sought them 
throughout all the way but found them not 
so the two men returned and descended from the mountain and 
passed over and came to joshua the son of nun and told him all 
things that befell them and they said unto joshua truly the 
lord hath delivered into our hands all the land for even all the 
inhabitants of the country do faint because of us 
and joshua rose early in the morning and they removed from 
shittim and came to jordan he and all the children of israel and 
lodged there before they passed over 
and it came to pass after three days that the officers went 
through the host and they commanded the people saying when ye 
see the ark of the covenant of the lord your god and the priests the 
levites bearing it then ye shall remove from your place and go after 
it 
yet there shall be a space between you and it about two thousand 
cubits by measure come not near unto it that ye may know the way by 
which ye must go for ye have not passed this way heretofore 
and joshua said unto the people sanctify yourselves for to 
morrow the lord will do wonders among you 
and joshua spake unto the priests saying take up the ark of the 
covenant and pass over before the people and they took up the ark of 
the covenant and went before the people 
and the lord said unto joshua this day will i begin to magnify 
thee in the sight of all israel that they may know that as i was 
with moses so i will be with thee 
and thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the 
covenant saying when ye are come to the brink of the water of 
jordan ye shall stand still in jordan 
and joshua said unto the children of israel come hither and hear 
the words of the lord your god 
and joshua said hereby ye shall know that the living god is 
among you and that he will without fail drive out from before you the 
canaanites and the hittites and the hivites and the perizzites and 
the girgashites and the amorites and the jebusites 
behold the ark of the covenant of the lord of all the earth 
passeth over before you into jordan 
now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of israel 
out of every tribe a man 
and it shall come to pass as soon as the soles of the feet of 
the priests that bear the ark of the lord the lord of all the earth 
shall rest in the waters of jordan that the waters of jordan shall be 
cut off from the waters that come down from above and they shall 
stand upon an heap 
and it came to pass when the people removed from their tents to 
pass over jordan and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant 
before the people and as they that bare the ark were come unto 
jordan and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in 
the brim of the water for jordan overfloweth all his banks all the 
time of harvest that the waters which came down from above 
stood and rose up upon an heap very far from the city adam that is 
beside zaretan and those that came down toward the sea of the plain 
even the salt sea failed and were cut off and the people passed 
over right against jericho 
and the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the lord 
stood firm on dry ground in the midst of jordan and all the 
israelites passed over on dry ground until all the people were passed 
clean over jordan 
and it came to pass when all the people were clean passed over 
jordan that the lord spake unto joshua saying take you twelve 
men out of the people out of every tribe a man and command ye 
them saying take you hence out of the midst of jordan out of the 
place where the priests feet stood firm twelve stones and ye shall 
carry them over with you and leave them in the lodging place where 
ye shall lodge this night 
then joshua called the twelve men whom he had prepared of the 
children of israel out of every tribe a man and joshua said unto 
them pass over before the ark of the lord your god into the midst of 
jordan and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder 
according unto the number of the tribes of the children of israel 
that this may be a sign among you that when your children ask their 
fathers in time to come saying what mean ye by these stones 
then ye shall answer them that the waters of jordan were cut off 
before the ark of the covenant of the lord when it passed over 
jordan the waters of jordan were cut off and these stones shall be 
for a memorial unto the children of israel for ever 
and the children of israel did so as joshua commanded and took up 
twelve stones out of the midst of jordan as the lord spake unto 
joshua according to the number of the tribes of the children of 
israel and carried them over with them unto the place where they 
lodged and laid them down there 
and joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of jordan in the 
place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant 
stood and they are there unto this day 
for the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of jordan 
until everything was finished that the lord commanded joshua to speak 
unto the people according to all that moses commanded joshua and the 
people hasted and passed over 
and it came to pass when all the people were clean passed over 
that the ark of the lord passed over and the priests in the presence 
of the people 
and the children of reuben and the children of gad and half the 
tribe of manasseh passed over armed before the children of israel as 
moses spake unto them about forty thousand prepared for war 
passed over before the lord unto battle to the plains of jericho 
on that day the lord magnified joshua in the sight of all israel 
and they feared him as they feared moses all the days of his life 
and the lord spake unto joshua saying command the priests 
that bear the ark of the testimony that they come up out of jordan 
joshua therefore commanded the priests saying come ye up out of 
jordan 
and it came to pass when the priests that bare the ark of the 
covenant of the lord were come up out of the midst of jordan and the 
soles of the priests feet were lifted up unto the dry land that the 
waters of jordan returned unto their place and flowed over all his 
banks as they did before 
and the people came up out of jordan on the tenth day of the 
first month and encamped in gilgal in the east border of jericho 
and those twelve stones which they took out of jordan did 
joshua pitch in gilgal 
and he spake unto the children of israel saying when your 
children shall ask their fathers in time to come saying what mean 
these stones then ye shall let your children know saying 
israel came over this jordan on dry land 
for the lord your god dried up the waters of jordan from before 
you until ye were passed over as the lord your god did to the red 
sea which he dried up from before us until we were gone over 
that all the people of the earth might know the hand of the lord that 
it is mighty that ye might fear the lord your god for ever 
and it came to pass when all the kings of the amorites which 
were on the side of jordan westward and all the kings of the 
canaanites which were by the sea heard that the lord had dried up 
the waters of jordan from before the children of israel until we were 
passed over that their heart melted neither was there spirit in them 
any more because of the children of israel 
at that time the lord said unto joshua make thee sharp knives 
and circumcise again the children of israel the second time 
and joshua made him sharp knives and circumcised the children of 
israel at the hill of the foreskins 
and this is the because why joshua did circumcise all the people 
that came out of egypt that were males even all the men of war died 
in the wilderness by the way after they came out of egypt 
now all the people that came out were circumcised but all the 
people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth 
out of egypt them they had not circumcised 
for the children of israel walked forty years in the wilderness 
till all the people that were men of war which came out of egypt 
were consumed because they obeyed not the voice of the lord unto 
whom the lord sware that he would not shew them the land which the 
lord sware unto their fathers that he would give us a land that 
floweth with milk and honey 
and their children whom he raised up in their stead them joshua 
circumcised for they were uncircumcised because they had not 
circumcised them by the way 
and it came to pass when they had done circumcising all the 
people that they abode in their places in the camp till they were 
whole 
and the lord said unto joshua this day have i rolled away the 
reproach of egypt from off you wherefore the name of the place is 
called gilgal unto this day 
and the children of israel encamped in gilgal and kept the 
passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of 
jericho 
and they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after 
the passover unleavened cakes and parched corn in the selfsame day 
and the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the 
old corn of the land neither had the children of israel manna any 
more but they did eat of the fruit of the land of canaan that year 
and it came to pass when joshua was by jericho that he lifted 
up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over against 
him with his sword drawn in his hand and joshua went unto him and 
said unto him art thou for us or for our adversaries and he 
said nay but as captain of the host of the lord am i now come and 
joshua fell on his face to the earth and did worship and said unto 
him what saith my lord unto his servant and the captain of the 
lord s host said unto joshua loose thy shoe from off thy foot for 
the place whereon thou standest is holy and joshua did so 
now jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of 
israel none went out and none came in 
and the lord said unto joshua see i have given into thine hand 
jericho and the king thereof and the mighty men of valour 
and ye shall compass the city all ye men of war and go round 
about the city once thus shalt thou do six days 
and seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of 
rams horns and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven 
times and the priests shall blow with the trumpets 
and it shall come to pass that when they make a long blast with 
the ram s horn and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet all the 
people shall shout with a great shout and the wall of the city shall 
fall down flat and the people shall ascend up every man straight 
before him 
and joshua the son of nun called the priests and said unto them 
take up the ark of the covenant and let seven priests bear seven 
trumpets of rams horns before the ark of the lord 
and he said unto the people pass on and compass the city and 
let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the lord 
and it came to pass when joshua had spoken unto the people that 
the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams horns passed on 
before the lord and blew with the trumpets and the ark of the 
covenant of the lord followed them 
and the armed men went before the priests that blew with the 
trumpets and the rereward came after the ark the priests going on 
and blowing with the trumpets 
and joshua had commanded the people saying ye shall not shout 
nor make any noise with your voice neither shall any word proceed out 
of your mouth until the day i bid you shout then shall ye shout 
so the ark of the lord compassed the city going about it once 
and they came into the camp and lodged in the camp 
and joshua rose early in the morning and the priests took up the 
ark of the lord 
and seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams horns before 
the ark of the lord went on continually and blew with the trumpets 
and the armed men went before them but the rereward came after the 
ark of the lord the priests going on and blowing with the trumpets 
and the second day they compassed the city once and returned 
into the camp so they did six days 
and it came to pass on the seventh day that they rose early 
about the dawning of the day and compassed the city after the same 
manner seven times only on that day they compassed the city seven 
times 
and it came to pass at the seventh time when the priests blew 
with the trumpets joshua said unto the people shout for the lord 
hath given you the city 
and the city shall be accursed even it and all that are 
therein to the lord only rahab the harlot shall live she and all 
that are with her in the house because she hid the messengers that we 
sent 
and ye in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing lest 
ye make yourselves accursed when ye take of the accursed thing and 
make the camp of israel a curse and trouble it 
but all the silver and gold and vessels of brass and iron are 
consecrated unto the lord they shall come into the treasury of the 
lord 
so the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets 
and it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the trumpet 
and the people shouted with a great shout that the wall fell down 
flat so that the people went up into the city every man straight 
before him and they took the city 
and they utterly destroyed all that was in the city both man and 
woman young and old and ox and sheep and ass with the edge of the 
sword 
but joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the 
country go into the harlot s house and bring out thence the woman 
and all that she hath as ye sware unto her 
and the young men that were spies went in and brought out rahab 
and her father and her mother and her brethren and all that she 
had and they brought out all her kindred and left them without the 
camp of israel 
and they burnt the city with fire and all that was therein only 
the silver and the gold and the vessels of brass and of iron they 
put into the treasury of the house of the lord 
and joshua saved rahab the harlot alive and her father s 
household and all that she had and she dwelleth in israel even unto 
this day because she hid the messengers which joshua sent to spy out 
jericho 
and joshua adjured them at that time saying cursed be the man 
before the lord that riseth up and buildeth this city jericho he 
shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn and in his youngest 
son shall he set up the gates of it 
so the lord was with joshua and his fame was noised throughout 
all the country 
but the children of israel committed a trespass in the accursed 
thing for achan the son of carmi the son of zabdi the son of 
zerah of the tribe of judah took of the accursed thing and the 
anger of the lord was kindled against the children of israel 
and joshua sent men from jericho to ai which is beside bethaven 
on the east of bethel and spake unto them saying go up and view the 
country 
and the men went up and viewed ai 
and they returned to joshua and said unto him let not all the 
people go up but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite 
ai and make not all the people to labour thither for they are but 
few 
so there went up thither of the people about three thousand men 
and they fled before the men of ai 
and the men of ai smote of them about thirty and six men for they 
chased them from before the gate even unto shebarim and smote them in 
the going down wherefore the hearts of the people melted and became 
as water 
and joshua rent his clothes and fell to the earth upon his face 
before the ark of the lord until the eventide he and the elders of 
israel and put dust upon their heads 
and joshua said alas o lord god wherefore hast thou at all 
brought this people over jordan to deliver us into the hand of the 
amorites to destroy us would to god we had been content and dwelt 
on the other side jordan o lord what shall i say when israel 
turneth their backs before their enemies for the canaanites and 
all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it and shall environ us 
round and cut off our name from the earth and what wilt thou do unto 
thy great name and the lord said unto joshua get thee up 
wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face israel hath sinned and 
they have also transgressed my covenant which i commanded them for 
they have even taken of the accursed thing and have also stolen and 
dissembled also and they have put it even among their own stuff 
therefore the children of israel could not stand before their 
enemies but turned their backs before their enemies because they 
were accursed neither will i be with you any more except ye destroy 
the accursed from among you 
up sanctify the people and say sanctify yourselves against to 
morrow for thus saith the lord god of israel there is an accursed 
thing in the midst of thee o israel thou canst not stand before 
thine enemies until ye take away the accursed thing from among you 
in the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your 
tribes and it shall be that the tribe which the lord taketh shall 
come according to the families thereof and the family which the lord 
shall take shall come by households and the household which the lord 
shall take shall come man by man 
and it shall be that he that is taken with the accursed thing 
shall be burnt with fire he and all that he hath because he hath 
transgressed the covenant of the lord and because he hath wrought 
folly in israel 
so joshua rose up early in the morning and brought israel by 
their tribes and the tribe of judah was taken and he brought 
the family of judah and he took the family of the zarhites and he 
brought the family of the zarhites man by man and zabdi was taken 
and he brought his household man by man and achan the son of 
carmi the son of zabdi the son of zerah of the tribe of judah was 
taken 
and joshua said unto achan my son give i pray thee glory to 
the lord god of israel and make confession unto him and tell me now 
what thou hast done hide it not from me 
and achan answered joshua and said indeed i have sinned against 
the lord god of israel and thus and thus have i done when i saw 
among the spoils a goodly babylonish garment and two hundred shekels 
of silver and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight then i coveted 
them and took them and behold they are hid in the earth in the 
midst of my tent and the silver under it 
so joshua sent messengers and they ran unto the tent and 
behold it was hid in his tent and the silver under it 
and they took them out of the midst of the tent and brought them 
unto joshua and unto all the children of israel and laid them out 
before the lord 
and joshua and all israel with him took achan the son of zerah 
and the silver and the garment and the wedge of gold and his sons 
and his daughters and his oxen and his asses and his sheep and his 
tent and all that he had and they brought them unto the valley of 
achor 
and joshua said why hast thou troubled us the lord shall 
trouble thee this day and all israel stoned him with stones and 
burned them with fire after they had stoned them with stones 
and they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day so 
the lord turned from the fierceness of his anger wherefore the name 
of that place was called the valley of achor unto this day 
and the lord said unto joshua fear not neither be thou dismayed 
take all the people of war with thee and arise go up to ai see i 
have given into thy hand the king of ai and his people and his city 
and his land and thou shalt do to ai and her king as thou didst 
unto jericho and her king only the spoil thereof and the cattle 
thereof shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves lay thee an ambush 
for the city behind it 
so joshua arose and all the people of war to go up against ai 
and joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour and sent 
them away by night 
and he commanded them saying behold ye shall lie in wait 
against the city even behind the city go not very far from the city 
but be ye all ready and i and all the people that are with me 
will approach unto the city and it shall come to pass when they come 
out against us as at the first that we will flee before them 
for they will come out after us till we have drawn them from the 
city for they will say they flee before us as at the first 
therefore we will flee before them 
then ye shall rise up from the ambush and seize upon the city 
for the lord your god will deliver it into your hand 
and it shall be when ye have taken the city that ye shall set 
the city on fire according to the commandment of the lord shall ye 
do see i have commanded you 
joshua therefore sent them forth and they went to lie in ambush 
and abode between bethel and ai on the west side of ai but joshua 
lodged that night among the people 
and joshua rose up early in the morning and numbered the people 
and went up he and the elders of israel before the people to ai 
and all the people even the people of war that were with him 
went up and drew nigh and came before the city and pitched on the 
north side of ai now there was a valley between them and ai 
and he took about five thousand men and set them to lie in 
ambush between bethel and ai on the west side of the city 
and when they had set the people even all the host that was on 
the north of the city and their liers in wait on the west of the 
city joshua went that night into the midst of the valley 
and it came to pass when the king of ai saw it that they hasted 
and rose up early and the men of the city went out against israel to 
battle he and all his people at a time appointed before the plain 
but he wist not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the 
city 
and joshua and all israel made as if they were beaten before 
them and fled by the way of the wilderness 
and all the people that were in ai were called together to pursue 
after them and they pursued after joshua and were drawn away from 
the city 
and there was not a man left in ai or bethel that went not out 
after israel and they left the city open and pursued after israel 
and the lord said unto joshua stretch out the spear that is in 
thy hand toward ai for i will give it into thine hand and joshua 
stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city 
and the ambush arose quickly out of their place and they ran as 
soon as he had stretched out his hand and they entered into the city 
and took it and hasted and set the city on fire 
and when the men of ai looked behind them they saw and behold 
the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven and they had no power to 
flee this way or that way and the people that fled to the wilderness 
turned back upon the pursuers 
and when joshua and all israel saw that the ambush had taken the 
city and that the smoke of the city ascended then they turned again 
and slew the men of ai 
and the other issued out of the city against them so they were 
in the midst of israel some on this side and some on that side and 
they smote them so that they let none of them remain or escape 
and the king of ai they took alive and brought him to joshua 
and it came to pass when israel had made an end of slaying all 
the inhabitants of ai in the field in the wilderness wherein they 
chased them and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword 
until they were consumed that all the israelites returned unto ai 
and smote it with the edge of the sword 
and so it was that all that fell that day both of men and 
women were twelve thousand even all the men of ai 
for joshua drew not his hand back wherewith he stretched out the 
spear until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of ai 
only the cattle and the spoil of that city israel took for a prey 
unto themselves according unto the word of the lord which he 
commanded joshua 
and joshua burnt ai and made it an heap for ever even a 
desolation unto this day 
and the king of ai he hanged on a tree until eventide and as 
soon as the sun was down joshua commanded that they should take his 
carcase down from the tree and cast it at the entering of the gate of 
the city and raise thereon a great heap of stones that remaineth 
unto this day 
then joshua built an altar unto the lord god of israel in mount 
ebal as moses the servant of the lord commanded the children of 
israel as it is written in the book of the law of moses an altar of 
whole stones over which no man hath lift up any iron and they 
offered thereon burnt offerings unto the lord and sacrificed peace 
offerings 
and he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of moses 
which he wrote in the presence of the children of israel 
and all israel and their elders and officers and their judges 
stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the 
levites which bare the ark of the covenant of the lord as well the 
stranger as he that was born among them half of them over against 
mount gerizim and half of them over against mount ebal as moses the 
servant of the lord had commanded before that they should bless the 
people of israel 
and afterward he read all the words of the law the blessings and 
cursings according to all that is written in the book of the law 
there was not a word of all that moses commanded which joshua 
read not before all the congregation of israel with the women and 
the little ones and the strangers that were conversant among them 
and it came to pass when all the kings which were on this side 
jordan in the hills and in the valleys and in all the coasts of the 
great sea over against lebanon the hittite and the amorite the 
canaanite the perizzite the hivite and the jebusite heard thereof 
that they gathered themselves together to fight with joshua and 
with israel with one accord 
and when the inhabitants of gibeon heard what joshua had done unto 
jericho and to ai they did work wilily and went and made as if 
they had been ambassadors and took old sacks upon their asses and 
wine bottles old and rent and bound up and old shoes and 
clouted upon their feet and old garments upon them and all the bread 
of their provision was dry and mouldy 
and they went to joshua unto the camp at gilgal and said unto 
him and to the men of israel we be come from a far country now 
therefore make ye a league with us 
and the men of israel said unto the hivites peradventure ye dwell 
among us and how shall we make a league with you and they said 
unto joshua we are thy servants and joshua said unto them who are 
ye and from whence come ye and they said unto him from a very 
far country thy servants are come because of the name of the lord thy 
god for we have heard the fame of him and all that he did in egypt 
and all that he did to the two kings of the amorites that were 
beyond jordan to sihon king of heshbon and to og king of bashan 
which was at ashtaroth 
wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake 
to us saying take victuals with you for the journey and go to meet 
them and say unto them we are your servants therefore now make ye a 
league with us 
this our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on 
the day we came forth to go unto you but now behold it is dry and 
it is mouldy and these bottles of wine which we filled were 
new and behold they be rent and these our garments and our shoes 
are become old by reason of the very long journey 
and the men took of their victuals and asked not counsel at the 
mouth of the lord 
and joshua made peace with them and made a league with them to 
let them live and the princes of the congregation sware unto them 
and it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made 
a league with them that they heard that they were their neighbours 
and that they dwelt among them 
and the children of israel journeyed and came unto their cities 
on the third day now their cities were gibeon and chephirah and 
beeroth and kirjathjearim 
and the children of israel smote them not because the princes of 
the congregation had sworn unto them by the lord god of israel and 
all the congregation murmured against the princes 
but all the princes said unto all the congregation we have sworn 
unto them by the lord god of israel now therefore we may not touch 
them 
this we will do to them we will even let them live lest wrath 
be upon us because of the oath which we sware unto them 
and the princes said unto them let them live but let them be 
hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation as the 
princes had promised them 
and joshua called for them and he spake unto them saying 
wherefore have ye beguiled us saying we are very far from you when 
ye dwell among us now therefore ye are cursed and there shall 
none of you be freed from being bondmen and hewers of wood and 
drawers of water for the house of my god 
and they answered joshua and said because it was certainly told 
thy servants how that the lord thy god commanded his servant moses to 
give you all the land and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land 
from before you therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of 
you and have done this thing 
and now behold we are in thine hand as it seemeth good and 
right unto thee to do unto us do 
and so did he unto them and delivered them out of the hand of 
the children of israel that they slew them not 
and joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water 
for the congregation and for the altar of the lord even unto this 
day in the place which he should choose 
now it came to pass when adonizedec king of jerusalem had heard 
how joshua had taken ai and had utterly destroyed it as he had done 
to jericho and her king so he had done to ai and her king and how 
the inhabitants of gibeon had made peace with israel and were among 
them that they feared greatly because gibeon was a great city 
as one of the royal cities and because it was greater than ai and 
all the men thereof were mighty 
wherefore adonizedec king of jerusalem sent unto hoham king of 
hebron and unto piram king of jarmuth and unto japhia king of 
lachish and unto debir king of eglon saying come up unto me 
and help me that we may smite gibeon for it hath made peace with 
joshua and with the children of israel 
therefore the five kings of the amorites the king of jerusalem 
the king of hebron the king of jarmuth the king of lachish the king 
of eglon gathered themselves together and went up they and all 
their hosts and encamped before gibeon and made war against it 
and the men of gibeon sent unto joshua to the camp to gilgal 
saying slack not thy hand from thy servants come up to us quickly 
and save us and help us for all the kings of the amorites that dwell 
in the mountains are gathered together against us 
so joshua ascended from gilgal he and all the people of war 
with him and all the mighty men of valour 
and the lord said unto joshua fear them not for i have 
delivered them into thine hand there shall not a man of them stand 
before thee 
joshua therefore came unto them suddenly and went up from gilgal 
all night 
and the lord discomfited them before israel and slew them with 
a great slaughter at gibeon and chased them along the way that goeth 
up to bethhoron and smote them to azekah and unto makkedah 
and it came to pass as they fled from before israel and were 
in the going down to bethhoron that the lord cast down great stones 
from heaven upon them unto azekah and they died they were more which 
died with hailstones than they whom the children of israel slew with 
the sword 
then spake joshua to the lord in the day when the lord delivered 
up the amorites before the children of israel and he said in the 
sight of israel sun stand thou still upon gibeon and thou moon in 
the valley of ajalon 
and the sun stood still and the moon stayed until the people 
had avenged themselves upon their enemies is not this written in the 
book of jasher so the sun stood still in the midst of heaven and 
hasted not to go down about a whole day 
and there was no day like that before it or after it that the 
lord hearkened unto the voice of a man for the lord fought for 
israel 
and joshua returned and all israel with him unto the camp to 
gilgal 
but these five kings fled and hid themselves in a cave at 
makkedah 
and it was told joshua saying the five kings are found hid in 
a cave at makkedah 
and joshua said roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave 
and set men by it for to keep them and stay ye not but pursue 
after your enemies and smite the hindmost of them suffer them not to 
enter into their cities for the lord your god hath delivered them 
into your hand 
and it came to pass when joshua and the children of israel had 
made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter till they 
were consumed that the rest which remained of them entered into 
fenced cities 
and all the people returned to the camp to joshua at makkedah in 
peace none moved his tongue against any of the children of israel 
then said joshua open the mouth of the cave and bring out 
those five kings unto me out of the cave 
and they did so and brought forth those five kings unto him out 
of the cave the king of jerusalem the king of hebron the king of 
jarmuth the king of lachish and the king of eglon 
and it came to pass when they brought out those kings unto 
joshua that joshua called for all the men of israel and said unto 
the captains of the men of war which went with him come near put 
your feet upon the necks of these kings and they came near and put 
their feet upon the necks of them 
and joshua said unto them fear not nor be dismayed be strong 
and of good courage for thus shall the lord do to all your enemies 
against whom ye fight 
and afterward joshua smote them and slew them and hanged them 
on five trees and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening 
and it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun 
that joshua commanded and they took them down off the trees and cast 
them into the cave wherein they had been hid and laid great stones in 
the cave s mouth which remain until this very day 
and that day joshua took makkedah and smote it with the edge of 
the sword and the king thereof he utterly destroyed them and all 
the souls that were therein he let none remain and he did to the 
king of makkedah as he did unto the king of jericho 
then joshua passed from makkedah and all israel with him unto 
libnah and fought against libnah and the lord delivered it 
also and the king thereof into the hand of israel and he smote it 
with the edge of the sword and all the souls that were therein he 
let none remain in it but did unto the king thereof as he did unto 
the king of jericho 
and joshua passed from libnah and all israel with him unto 
lachish and encamped against it and fought against it and the 
lord delivered lachish into the hand of israel which took it on the 
second day and smote it with the edge of the sword and all the souls 
that were therein according to all that he had done to libnah 
then horam king of gezer came up to help lachish and joshua 
smote him and his people until he had left him none remaining 
and from lachish joshua passed unto eglon and all israel with 
him and they encamped against it and fought against it and 
they took it on that day and smote it with the edge of the sword and 
all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day 
according to all that he had done to lachish 
and joshua went up from eglon and all israel with him unto 
hebron and they fought against it and they took it and smote 
it with the edge of the sword and the king thereof and all the 
cities thereof and all the souls that were therein he left none 
remaining according to all that he had done to eglon but destroyed 
it utterly and all the souls that were therein 
and joshua returned and all israel with him to debir and 
fought against it and he took it and the king thereof and all 
the cities thereof and they smote them with the edge of the sword 
and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein he left none 
remaining as he had done to hebron so he did to debir and to the 
king thereof as he had done also to libnah and to her king 
so joshua smote all the country of the hills and of the south 
and of the vale and of the springs and all their kings he left none 
remaining but utterly destroyed all that breathed as the lord god of 
israel commanded 
and joshua smote them from kadeshbarnea even unto gaza and all 
the country of goshen even unto gibeon 
and all these kings and their land did joshua take at one time 
because the lord god of israel fought for israel 
and joshua returned and all israel with him unto the camp to 
gilgal 
and it came to pass when jabin king of hazor had heard those 
things that he sent to jobab king of madon and to the king of 
shimron and to the king of achshaph and to the kings that were 
on the north of the mountains and of the plains south of chinneroth 
and in the valley and in the borders of dor on the west and to 
the canaanite on the east and on the west and to the amorite and the 
hittite and the perizzite and the jebusite in the mountains and to 
the hivite under hermon in the land of mizpeh 
and they went out they and all their hosts with them much 
people even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude with 
horses and chariots very many 
and when all these kings were met together they came and pitched 
together at the waters of merom to fight against israel 
and the lord said unto joshua be not afraid because of them for 
to morrow about this time will i deliver them up all slain before 
israel thou shalt hough their horses and burn their chariots with 
fire 
so joshua came and all the people of war with him against them 
by the waters of merom suddenly and they fell upon them 
and the lord delivered them into the hand of israel who smote 
them and chased them unto great zidon and unto misrephothmaim and 
unto the valley of mizpeh eastward and they smote them until they 
left them none remaining 
and joshua did unto them as the lord bade him he houghed their 
horses and burnt their chariots with fire 
and joshua at that time turned back and took hazor and smote 
the king thereof with the sword for hazor beforetime was the head of 
all those kingdoms 
and they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of 
the sword utterly destroying them there was not any left to breathe 
and he burnt hazor with fire 
and all the cities of those kings and all the kings of them 
did joshua take and smote them with the edge of the sword and he 
utterly destroyed them as moses the servant of the lord commanded 
but as for the cities that stood still in their strength israel 
burned none of them save hazor only that did joshua burn 
and all the spoil of these cities and the cattle the children 
of israel took for a prey unto themselves but every man they smote 
with the edge of the sword until they had destroyed them neither 
left they any to breathe 
as the lord commanded moses his servant so did moses command 
joshua and so did joshua he left nothing undone of all that the lord 
commanded moses 
so joshua took all that land the hills and all the south 
country and all the land of goshen and the valley and the plain 
and the mountain of israel and the valley of the same even 
from the mount halak that goeth up to seir even unto baalgad in the 
valley of lebanon under mount hermon and all their kings he took and 
smote them and slew them 
joshua made war a long time with all those kings 
there was not a city that made peace with the children of 
israel save the hivites the inhabitants of gibeon all other they 
took in battle 
for it was of the lord to harden their hearts that they should 
come against israel in battle that he might destroy them utterly and 
that they might have no favour but that he might destroy them as the 
lord commanded moses 
and at that time came joshua and cut off the anakims from the 
mountains from hebron from debir from anab and from all the 
mountains of judah and from all the mountains of israel joshua 
destroyed them utterly with their cities 
there was none of the anakims left in the land of the children 
of israel only in gaza in gath and in ashdod there remained 
so joshua took the whole land according to all that the lord 
said unto moses and joshua gave it for an inheritance unto israel 
according to their divisions by their tribes and the land rested from 
war 
now these are the kings of the land which the children of israel 
smote and possessed their land on the other side jordan toward the 
rising of the sun from the river arnon unto mount hermon and all the 
plain on the east sihon king of the amorites who dwelt in 
heshbon and ruled from aroer which is upon the bank of the river 
arnon and from the middle of the river and from half gilead even 
unto the river jabbok which is the border of the children of ammon 
and from the plain to the sea of chinneroth on the east and unto 
the sea of the plain even the salt sea on the east the way to 
bethjeshimoth and from the south under ashdothpisgah and the 
coast of og king of bashan which was of the remnant of the giants 
that dwelt at ashtaroth and at edrei and reigned in mount 
hermon and in salcah and in all bashan unto the border of the 
geshurites and the maachathites and half gilead the border of sihon 
king of heshbon 
them did moses the servant of the lord and the children of israel 
smite and moses the servant of the lord gave it for a possession unto 
the reubenites and the gadites and the half tribe of manasseh 
and these are the kings of the country which joshua and the 
children of israel smote on this side jordan on the west from baalgad 
in the valley of lebanon even unto the mount halak that goeth up to 
seir which joshua gave unto the tribes of israel for a possession 
according to their divisions in the mountains and in the 
valleys and in the plains and in the springs and in the wilderness 
and in the south country the hittites the amorites and the 
canaanites the perizzites the hivites and the jebusites the 
king of jericho one the king of ai which is beside bethel one 
the king of jerusalem one the king of hebron one the 
king of jarmuth one the king of lachish one the king of 
eglon one the king of gezer one the king of debir one the 
king of geder one the king of hormah one the king of arad 
one the king of libnah one the king of adullam one 
the king of makkedah one the king of bethel one the king of 
tappuah one the king of hepher one the king of aphek one 
the king of lasharon one the king of madon one the king of 
hazor one the king of shimronmeron one the king of achshaph 
one the king of taanach one the king of megiddo one 
the king of kedesh one the king of jokneam of carmel one the 
king of dor in the coast of dor one the king of the nations of 
gilgal one the king of tirzah one all the kings thirty and 
one 
now joshua was old and stricken in years and the lord said unto 
him thou art old and stricken in years and there remaineth yet very 
much land to be possessed 
this is the land that yet remaineth all the borders of the 
philistines and all geshuri from sihor which is before egypt 
even unto the borders of ekron northward which is counted to the 
canaanite five lords of the philistines the gazathites and the 
ashdothites the eshkalonites the gittites and the ekronites also 
the avites from the south all the land of the canaanites and 
mearah that is beside the sidonians unto aphek to the borders of the 
amorites and the land of the giblites and all lebanon toward 
the sunrising from baalgad under mount hermon unto the entering into 
hamath 
all the inhabitants of the hill country from lebanon unto 
misrephothmaim and all the sidonians them will i drive out from 
before the children of israel only divide thou it by lot unto the 
israelites for an inheritance as i have commanded thee 
now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine 
tribes and the half tribe of manasseh with whom the reubenites 
and the gadites have received their inheritance which moses gave 
them beyond jordan eastward even as moses the servant of the lord 
gave them from aroer that is upon the bank of the river arnon 
and the city that is in the midst of the river and all the plain of 
medeba unto dibon and all the cities of sihon king of the 
amorites which reigned in heshbon unto the border of the children of 
ammon and gilead and the border of the geshurites and 
maachathites and all mount hermon and all bashan unto salcah 
all the kingdom of og in bashan which reigned in ashtaroth and in 
edrei who remained of the remnant of the giants for these did moses 
smite and cast them out 
nevertheless the children of israel expelled not the geshurites 
nor the maachathites but the geshurites and the maachathites dwell 
among the israelites until this day 
only unto the tribes of levi he gave none inheritance the 
sacrifices of the lord god of israel made by fire are their 
inheritance as he said unto them 
and moses gave unto the tribe of the children of reuben 
inheritance according to their families 
and their coast was from aroer that is on the bank of the river 
arnon and the city that is in the midst of the river and all the 
plain by medeba heshbon and all her cities that are in the 
plain dibon and bamothbaal and bethbaalmeon and jahaza and 
kedemoth and mephaath and kirjathaim and sibmah and 
zarethshahar in the mount of the valley and bethpeor and 
ashdothpisgah and bethjeshimoth and all the cities of the 
plain and all the kingdom of sihon king of the amorites which 
reigned in heshbon whom moses smote with the princes of midian evi 
and rekem and zur and hur and reba which were dukes of sihon 
dwelling in the country 
balaam also the son of beor the soothsayer did the children of 
israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them 
and the border of the children of reuben was jordan and the 
border thereof this was the inheritance of the children of reuben 
after their families the cities and the villages thereof 
and moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of gad even unto the 
children of gad according to their families 
and their coast was jazer and all the cities of gilead and 
half the land of the children of ammon unto aroer that is before 
rabbah and from heshbon unto ramathmizpeh and betonim and 
from mahanaim unto the border of debir and in the valley 
betharam and bethnimrah and succoth and zaphon the rest of the 
kingdom of sihon king of heshbon jordan and his border even unto the 
edge of the sea of chinnereth on the other side jordan eastward 
this is the inheritance of the children of gad after their 
families the cities and their villages 
and moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of manasseh and 
this was the possession of the half tribe of the children of manasseh 
by their families 
and their coast was from mahanaim all bashan all the kingdom 
of og king of bashan and all the towns of jair which are in bashan 
threescore cities and half gilead and ashtaroth and edrei 
cities of the kingdom of og in bashan were pertaining unto the 
children of machir the son of manasseh even to the one half of the 
children of machir by their families 
these are the countries which moses did distribute for 
inheritance in the plains of moab on the other side jordan by 
jericho eastward 
but unto the tribe of levi moses gave not any inheritance the 
lord god of israel was their inheritance as he said unto them 
and these are the countries which the children of israel 
inherited in the land of canaan which eleazar the priest and joshua 
the son of nun and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the 
children of israel distributed for inheritance to them 
by lot was their inheritance as the lord commanded by the hand 
of moses for the nine tribes and for the half tribe 
for moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half 
tribe on the other side jordan but unto the levites he gave none 
inheritance among them 
for the children of joseph were two tribes manasseh and ephraim 
therefore they gave no part unto the levites in the land save cities 
to dwell in with their suburbs for their cattle and for their 
substance 
as the lord commanded moses so the children of israel did and 
they divided the land 
then the children of judah came unto joshua in gilgal and caleb 
the son of jephunneh the kenezite said unto him thou knowest the 
thing that the lord said unto moses the man of god concerning me and 
thee in kadeshbarnea 
forty years old was i when moses the servant of the lord sent me 
from kadeshbarnea to espy out the land and i brought him word again 
as it was in mine heart 
nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of 
the people melt but i wholly followed the lord my god 
and moses sware on that day saying surely the land whereon thy 
feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance and thy children s for 
ever because thou hast wholly followed the lord my god 
and now behold the lord hath kept me alive as he said these 
forty and five years even since the lord spake this word unto moses 
while the children of israel wandered in the wilderness and now lo 
i am this day fourscore and five years old 
as yet i am as strong this day as i was in the day that moses 
sent me as my strength was then even so is my strength now for war 
both to go out and to come in 
now therefore give me this mountain whereof the lord spake in 
that day for thou heardest in that day how the anakims were there 
and that the cities were great and fenced if so be the lord will be 
with me then i shall be able to drive them out as the lord said 
and joshua blessed him and gave unto caleb the son of jephunneh 
hebron for an inheritance 
hebron therefore became the inheritance of caleb the son of 
jephunneh the kenezite unto this day because that he wholly followed 
the lord god of israel 
and the name of hebron before was kirjatharba which arba was a 
great man among the anakims and the land had rest from war 
this then was the lot of the tribe of the children of judah by 
their families even to the border of edom the wilderness of zin

south side unto kadeshbarnea and passed along to hezron and went up 
to adar and fetched a compass to karkaa from thence it passed 
toward azmon and went out unto the river of egypt and the goings out 
of that coast were at the sea this shall be your south coast 
and the east border was the salt sea even unto the end of 
jordan 
and their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at 
the uttermost part of jordan and the border went up to 
bethhogla and passed along by the north of betharabah and the border 
went up to the stone of bohan the son of reuben and the border 
went up toward debir from the valley of achor and so northward 
looking toward gilgal that is before the going up to adummim which 
is on the south side of the river and the border passed toward the 
waters of enshemesh and the goings out thereof were at enrogel 
and the border went up by the valley of the son of hinnom unto the 
south side of the jebusite the same is jerusalem and the border went 
up to the top of the mountain that lieth before the valley of hinnom 
westward which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward 
and the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the 
fountain of the water of nephtoah and went out to the cities of mount

and passed along unto the side of mount jearim which is chesalon on 
the north side and went down to bethshemesh and passed on to timnah 
and the border went out unto the side of ekron northward and 
the border was drawn to shicron and passed along to mount baalah and 
went out unto jabneel and the goings out of the border were at the 
sea 
and the west border was to the great sea and the coast thereof 
this is the coast of the children of judah round about according to 
their families 
and unto caleb the son of jephunneh he gave a part among the 
children of judah according to the commandment of the lord to joshua 
even the city of arba the father of anak which city is hebron 
and caleb drove thence the three sons of anak sheshai and 
ahiman and talmai the children of anak 
and he went up thence to the inhabitants of debir and the name 
of debir before was kirjathsepher 
and caleb said he that smiteth kirjathsepher and taketh it to 
him will i give achsah my daughter to wife 
and othniel the son of kenaz the brother of caleb took it and 
he gave him achsah his daughter to wife 
and it came to pass as she came unto him that she moved him to 
ask of her father a field and she lighted off her ass and caleb said 
unto her what wouldest thou who answered give me a blessing 
for thou hast given me a south land give me also springs of water 
and he gave her the upper springs and the nether springs 
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of judah 
according to their families 
and the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of judah 
toward the coast of edom southward were kabzeel and eder and jagur

as for the jebusites the inhabitants of jerusalem the children 
of judah could not drive them out but the jebusites dwell with the 
children of judah at jerusalem unto this day 
and the lot of the children of joseph fell from jordan by 
jericho unto the water of jericho on the east to the wilderness that 
goeth up from jericho throughout mount bethel and goeth out from 
bethel to luz and passeth along unto the borders of archi to ataroth 
and goeth down westward to the coast of japhleti unto the coast 
of bethhoron the nether and to gezer and the goings out thereof are 
at the sea 
so the children of joseph manasseh and ephraim took their 
inheritance 
and the border of the children of ephraim according to their 
families was thus even the border of their inheritance on the east 
side was atarothaddar unto bethhoron the upper and the border 
went out toward the sea to michmethah on the north side and the 
border went about eastward unto taanathshiloh and passed by it on the 
east to janohah and it went down from janohah to ataroth and to 
naarath and came to jericho and went out at jordan 
the border went out from tappuah westward unto the river kanah 
and the goings out thereof were at the sea this is the inheritance of 
the tribe of the children of ephraim by their families 
and the separate cities for the children of ephraim were among 
the inheritance of the children of manasseh all the cities with their 
villages 
and they drave not out the canaanites that dwelt in gezer but 
the canaanites dwell among the ephraimites unto this day and serve 
under tribute 
there was also a lot for the tribe of manasseh for he was the 
firstborn of joseph to wit for machir the firstborn of manasseh the 
father of gilead because he was a man of war therefore he had gilead 
and bashan 
there was also a lot for the rest of the children of manasseh by 
their families for the children of abiezer and for the children of 
helek and for the children of asriel and for the children of 
shechem and for the children of hepher and for the children of 
shemida these were the male children of manasseh the son of joseph by 
their families 
but zelophehad the son of hepher the son of gilead the son of 
machir the son of manasseh had no sons but daughters and these are 
the names of his daughters mahlah and noah hoglah milcah and 
tirzah 
and they came near before eleazar the priest and before joshua 
the son of nun and before the princes saying the lord commanded 
moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren therefore 
according to the commandment of the lord he gave them an inheritance 
among the brethren of their father 
and there fell ten portions to manasseh beside the land of 
gilead and bashan which were on the other side jordan because 
the daughters of manasseh had an inheritance among his sons and the 
rest of manasseh s sons had the land of gilead 
and the coast of manasseh was from asher to michmethah that 
lieth before shechem and the border went along on the right hand unto 
the inhabitants of entappuah 
now manasseh had the land of tappuah but tappuah on the border 
of manasseh belonged to the children of ephraim and the coast 
descended unto the river kanah southward of the river these cities 
of ephraim are among the cities of manasseh the coast of manasseh 
also was on the north side of the river and the outgoings of it were 
at the sea southward it was ephraim s and northward it was 
manasseh s and the sea is his border and they met together in asher 
on the north and in issachar on the east 
and manasseh had in issachar and in asher bethshean and her 
towns and ibleam and her towns and the inhabitants of dor and her 
towns and the inhabitants of endor and her towns and the inhabitants 
of taanach and her towns and the inhabitants of megiddo and her 
towns even three countries 
yet the children of manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants 
of those cities but the canaanites would dwell in that land 
yet it came to pass when the children of israel were waxen 
strong that they put the canaanites to tribute but did not utterly 
drive them out 
and the children of joseph spake unto joshua saying why hast 
thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit seeing i am a 
great people forasmuch as the lord hath blessed me hitherto 
and joshua answered them if thou be a great people then get thee up 
to the wood country and cut down for thyself there in the land of the 
perizzites and of the giants if mount ephraim be too narrow for thee 
and the children of joseph said the hill is not enough for us 
and all the canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have 
chariots of iron both they who are of bethshean and her towns and 
they who are of the valley of jezreel 
and joshua spake unto the house of joseph even to ephraim and 
to manasseh saying thou art a great people and hast great power 
thou shalt not have one lot only but the mountain shall be 
thine for it is a wood and thou shalt cut it down and the outgoings 
of it shall be thine for thou shalt drive out the canaanites though 
they have iron chariots and though they be strong 
and the whole congregation of the children of israel assembled 
together at shiloh and set up the tabernacle of the congregation 
there and the land was subdued before them 
and there remained among the children of israel seven tribes 
which had not yet received their inheritance 
and joshua said unto the children of israel how long are ye 
slack to go to possess the land which the lord god of your fathers 
hath given you give out from among you three men for each 
tribe and i will send them and they shall rise and go through the 
land and describe it according to the inheritance of them and they 
shall come again to me 
and they shall divide it into seven parts judah shall abide in 
their coast on the south and the house of joseph shall abide in their 
coasts on the north 
ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts and bring 
the description hither to me that i may cast lots for you here before 
the lord our god 
but the levites have no part among you for the priesthood of the 
lord is their inheritance and gad and reuben and half the tribe of 
manasseh have received their inheritance beyond jordan on the east 
which moses the servant of the lord gave them 
and the men arose and went away and joshua charged them that 
went to describe the land saying go and walk through the land and 
describe it and come again to me that i may here cast lots for you 
before the lord in shiloh 
and the men went and passed through the land and described it by 
cities into seven parts in a book and came again to joshua to the 
host at shiloh 
and joshua cast lots for them in shiloh before the lord and 
there joshua divided the land unto the children of israel according to 
their divisions

the lord also spake unto joshua saying speak to the 
children of israel saying appoint out for you cities of refuge 
whereof i spake unto you by the hand of moses that the slayer 
that killeth any person unawares and unwittingly may flee thither and 
they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood 
and when he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall stand 
at the entering of the gate of the city and shall declare his because 
in the ears of the elders of that city they shall take him into the 
city unto them and give him a place that he may dwell among them 
and if the avenger of blood pursue after him then they shall not 
deliver the slayer up into his hand because he smote his neighbour 
unwittingly and hated him not beforetime 
and he shall dwell in that city until he stand before the 
congregation for judgment and until the death of the high priest that 
shall be in those days then shall the slayer return and come unto 
his own city and unto his own house unto the city from whence he

and for the stranger that sojourneth among them that whosoever 
killeth any person at unawares might flee thither and not die by the 
hand of the avenger of blood until he stood before the congregation 
then came near the heads of the fathers of the levites unto 
eleazar the priest and unto joshua the son of nun and unto the heads 
of the fathers of the tribes of the children of israel and they 
spake unto them at shiloh in the land of canaan saying the lord 
commanded by the hand of moses to give us cities to dwell in with the 
suburbs thereof for our cattle 
and the children of israel gave unto the levites out of their 
inheritance at the commandment of the lord these cities and their

so all the cities for the children of merari by their families 
which were remaining of the families of the levites were by their lot 
twelve cities 
all the cities of the levites within the possession of the 
children of israel were forty and eight cities with their suburbs 
these cities were every one with their suburbs round about them 
thus were all these cities 
and the lord gave unto israel all the land which he sware to 
give unto their fathers and they possessed it and dwelt therein 
and the lord gave them rest round about according to all that 
he sware unto their fathers and there stood not a man of all their 
enemies before them the lord delivered all their enemies into their 
hand 
there failed not ought of any good thing which the lord had 
spoken unto the house of israel all came to pass 
then joshua called the reubenites and the gadites and the half 
tribe of manasseh and said unto them ye have kept all that 
moses the servant of the lord commanded you and have obeyed my voice 
in all that i commanded you ye have not left your brethren these 
many days unto this day but have kept the charge of the commandment 
of the lord your god 
and now the lord your god hath given rest unto your brethren as 
he promised them therefore now return ye and get you unto your 
tents and unto the land of your possession which moses the servant 
of the lord gave you on the other side jordan 
but take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law which 
moses the servant of the lord charged you to love the lord your god 
and to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments and to 
cleave unto him and to serve him with all your heart and with all 
your soul 
so joshua blessed them and sent them away and they went unto 
their tents 
now to the one half of the tribe of manasseh moses had given 
possession in bashan but unto the other half thereof gave joshua 
among their brethren on this side jordan westward and when joshua 
sent them away also unto their tents then he blessed them and 
he spake unto them saying return with much riches unto your tents 
and with very much cattle with silver and with gold and with brass 
and with iron and with very much raiment divide the spoil of your 
enemies with your brethren 
and the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half 
tribe of manasseh returned and departed from the children of israel 
out of shiloh which is in the land of canaan to go unto the country 
of gilead to the land of their possession whereof they were 
possessed according to the word of the lord by the hand of moses 
and when they came unto the borders of jordan that are in the 
land of canaan the children of reuben and the children of gad and the 
half tribe of manasseh built there an altar by jordan a great altar 
to see to 
and the children of israel heard say behold the children of 
reuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh have 
built an altar over against the land of canaan in the borders of 
jordan at the passage of the children of israel 
and when the children of israel heard of it the whole 
congregation of the children of israel gathered themselves together at 
shiloh to go up to war against them 
and the children of israel sent unto the children of reuben and 
to the children of gad and to the half tribe of manasseh into the 
land of gilead phinehas the son of eleazar the priest and with 
him ten princes of each chief house a prince throughout all the 
tribes of israel and each one was an head of the house of their 
fathers among the thousands of israel 
and they came unto the children of reuben and to the children 
of gad and to the half tribe of manasseh unto the land of gilead 
and they spake with them saying thus saith the whole 
congregation of the lord what trespass is this that ye have committed 
against the god of israel to turn away this day from following the 
lord in that ye have builded you an altar that ye might rebel this 
day against the lord is the iniquity of peor too little for 
us from which we are not cleansed until this day although there was 
a plague in the congregation of the lord but that ye must turn 
away this day from following the lord and it will be seeing ye rebel 
to day against the lord that to morrow he will be wroth with the 
whole congregation of israel 
notwithstanding if the land of your possession be unclean then 
pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the lord wherein the 
lord s tabernacle dwelleth and take possession among us but rebel 
not against the lord nor rebel against us in building you an altar 
beside the altar of the lord our god 
did not achan the son of zerah commit a trespass in the accursed 
thing and wrath fell on all the congregation of israel and that man 
perished not alone in his iniquity 
then the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half 
tribe of manasseh answered and said unto the heads of the thousands 
of israel the lord god of gods the lord god of gods he 
knoweth and israel he shall know if it be in rebellion or if in 
transgression against the lord save us not this day that we 
have built us an altar to turn from following the lord or if to offer 
thereon burnt offering or meat offering or if to offer peace 
offerings thereon let the lord himself require it and if we 
have not rather done it for fear of this thing saying in time to 
come your children might speak unto our children saying what have ye 
to do with the lord god of israel for the lord hath made 
jordan a border between us and you ye children of reuben and children 
of gad ye have no part in the lord so shall your children make our 
children cease from fearing the lord 
therefore we said let us now prepare to build us an altar not 
for burnt offering nor for sacrifice but that it may be a 
witness between us and you and our generations after us that we 
might do the service of the lord before him with our burnt offerings 
and with our sacrifices and with our peace offerings that your 
children may not say to our children in time to come ye have no part 
in the lord 
therefore said we that it shall be when they should so say to 
us or to our generations in time to come that we may say again 
behold the pattern of the altar of the lord which our fathers made 
not for burnt offerings nor for sacrifices but it is a witness 
between us and you 
god forbid that we should rebel against the lord and turn this 
day from following the lord to build an altar for burnt offerings 
for meat offerings or for sacrifices beside the altar of the lord 
our god that is before his tabernacle 
and when phinehas the priest and the princes of the 
congregation and heads of the thousands of israel which were with him 
heard the words that the children of reuben and the children of gad 
and the children of manasseh spake it pleased them 
and phinehas the son of eleazar the priest said unto the 
children of reuben and to the children of gad and to the children of 
manasseh this day we perceive that the lord is among us because ye 
have not committed this trespass against the lord now ye have 
delivered the children of israel out of the hand of the lord 
and phinehas the son of eleazar the priest and the princes 
returned from the children of reuben and from the children of gad 
out of the land of gilead unto the land of canaan to the children of 
israel and brought them word again 
and the thing pleased the children of israel and the children 
of israel blessed god and did not intend to go up against them in 
battle to destroy the land wherein the children of reuben and gad 
dwelt 
and the children of reuben and the children of gad called the 
altar ed for it shall be a witness between us that the lord is god 
and it came to pass a long time after that the lord had given 
rest unto israel from all their enemies round about that joshua waxed 
old and stricken in age 
and joshua called for all israel and for their elders and for 
their heads and for their judges and for their officers and said 
unto them i am old and stricken in age and ye have seen all 
that the lord your god hath done unto all these nations because of 
you for the lord your god is he that hath fought for you 
behold i have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain 
to be an inheritance for your tribes from jordan with all the 
nations that i have cut off even unto the great sea westward 
and the lord your god he shall expel them from before you and 
drive them from out of your sight and ye shall possess their land as 
the lord your god hath promised unto you 
be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is 
written in the book of the law of moses that ye turn not aside 
therefrom to the right hand or to the left that ye come not 
among these nations these that remain among you neither make mention 
of the name of their gods nor because to swear by them neither serve 
them nor bow yourselves unto them but cleave unto the lord your 
god as ye have done unto this day 
for the lord hath driven out from before you great nations and 
strong but as for you no man hath been able to stand before you unto 
this day 
one man of you shall chase a thousand for the lord your god he 
it is that fighteth for you as he hath promised you 
take good heed therefore unto yourselves that ye love the lord 
your god 
else if ye do in any wise go back and cleave unto the remnant 
of these nations even these that remain among you and shall make 
marriages with them and go in unto them and they to you know 
for a certainty that the lord your god will no more drive out any of 
these nations from before you but they shall be snares and traps unto 
you and scourges in your sides and thorns in your eyes until ye 
perish from off this good land which the lord your god hath given you 
and behold this day i am going the way of all the earth and 
ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls that not one thing 
hath failed of all the good things which the lord your god spake 
concerning you all are come to pass unto you and not one thing hath 
failed thereof 
therefore it shall come to pass that as all good things are 
come upon you which the lord your god promised you so shall the lord 
bring upon you all evil things until he have destroyed you from off 
this good land which the lord your god hath given you 
when ye have transgressed the covenant of the lord your god 
which he commanded you and have gone and served other gods and bowed 
yourselves to them then shall the anger of the lord be kindled 
against you and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which 
he hath given unto you 
and joshua gathered all the tribes of israel to shechem and 
called for the elders of israel and for their heads and for their 
judges and for their officers and they presented themselves before 
god 
and joshua said unto all the people thus saith the lord god of 
israel your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time 
even terah the father of abraham and the father of nachor and they 
served other gods 
and i took your father abraham from the other side of the flood 
and led him throughout all the land of canaan and multiplied his 
seed and gave him isaac 
and i gave unto isaac jacob and esau and i gave unto esau mount 
seir to possess it but jacob and his children went down into egypt 
i sent moses also and aaron and i plagued egypt according to 
that which i did among them and afterward i brought you out 
and i brought your fathers out of egypt and ye came unto the 
sea and the egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and 
horsemen unto the red sea 
and when they cried unto the lord he put darkness between you 
and the egyptians and brought the sea upon them and covered them 
and your eyes have seen what i have done in egypt and ye dwelt in the 
wilderness a long season 
and i brought you into the land of the amorites which dwelt on 
the other side jordan and they fought with you and i gave them into 
your hand that ye might possess their land and i destroyed them from 
before you 
then balak the son of zippor king of moab arose and warred 
against israel and sent and called balaam the son of beor to curse 
you but i would not hearken unto balaam therefore he blessed 
you still so i delivered you out of his hand 
and you went over jordan and came unto jericho and the men of 
jericho fought against you the amorites and the perizzites and the 
canaanites and the hittites and the girgashites the hivites and 
the jebusites and i delivered them into your hand 
and i sent the hornet before you which drave them out from 
before you even the two kings of the amorites but not with thy 
sword nor with thy bow 
and i have given you a land for which ye did not labour and 
cities which ye built not and ye dwell in them of the vineyards and 
oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat 
now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in 
truth and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other 
side of the flood and in egypt and serve ye the lord 
and if it seem evil unto you to serve the lord choose you this 
day whom ye will serve whether the gods which your fathers served 
that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites 
in whose land ye dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the 
lord 
and the people answered and said god forbid that we should 
forsake the lord to serve other gods for the lord our god he 
it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of egypt 
from the house of bondage and which did those great signs in our 
sight and preserved us in all the way wherein we went and among all 
the people through whom we passed and the lord drave out from 
before us all the people even the amorites which dwelt in the land 
therefore will we also serve the lord for he is our god 
and joshua said unto the people ye cannot serve the lord for 
he is an holy god he is a jealous god he will not forgive your 
transgressions nor your sins 
if ye forsake the lord and serve strange gods then he will 
turn and do you hurt and consume you after that he hath done you 
good 
and the people said unto joshua nay but we will serve the 
lord 
and joshua said unto the people ye are witnesses against 
yourselves that ye have chosen you the lord to serve him and they 
said we are witnesses 
now therefore put away said he the strange gods which are 
among you and incline your heart unto the lord god of israel 
and the people said unto joshua the lord our god will we serve 
and his voice will we obey 
so joshua made a covenant with the people that day and set them 
a statute and an ordinance in shechem 
and joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of god and 
took a great stone and set it up there under an oak that was by the 
sanctuary of the lord 
and joshua said unto all the people behold this stone shall be 
a witness unto us for it hath heard all the words of the lord which 
he spake unto us it shall be therefore a witness unto you lest ye 
deny your god 
so joshua let the people depart every man unto his inheritance 
and it came to pass after these things that joshua the son of 
nun the servant of the lord died being an hundred and ten years 
old 
and they buried him in the border of his inheritance in 
timnathserah which is in mount ephraim on the north side of the hill 
of gaash 
and israel served the lord all the days of joshua and all the 
days of the elders that overlived joshua and which had known all the 
works of the lord that he had done for israel 
and the bones of joseph which the children of israel brought up 
out of egypt buried they in shechem in a parcel of ground which 
jacob bought of the sons of hamor the father of shechem for an hundred 
pieces of silver and it became the inheritance of the children of 
joseph 
and eleazar the son of aaron died and they buried him in a hill 
that pertained to phinehas his son which was given him in mount 
ephraim 
the book of judges 
now after the death of joshua it came to pass that the children 
of israel asked the lord saying who shall go up for us against the 
canaanites first to fight against them and the lord said judah 
shall go up behold i have delivered the land into his hand 
and judah said unto simeon his brother come up with me into my 
lot that we may fight against the canaanites and i likewise will go 
with thee into thy lot so simeon went with him 
and judah went up and the lord delivered the canaanites and the 
perizzites into their hand and they slew of them in bezek ten 
thousand men 
and they found adonibezek in bezek and they fought against him 
and they slew the canaanites and the perizzites 
but adonibezek fled and they pursued after him and caught him 
and cut off his thumbs and his great toes 
and adonibezek said threescore and ten kings having their thumbs 
and their great toes cut off gathered their meat under my table as i 
have done so god hath requited me and they brought him to jerusalem 
and there he died 
now the children of judah had fought against jerusalem and had 
taken it and smitten it with the edge of the sword and set the city 
on fire 
and afterward the children of judah went down to fight against the 
canaanites that dwelt in the mountain and in the south and in the 
valley 
and judah went against the canaanites that dwelt in hebron now 
the name of hebron before was kirjatharba and they slew sheshai and 
ahiman and talmai 
and from thence he went against the inhabitants of debir and the 
name of debir before was kirjathsepher and caleb said he that 
smiteth kirjathsepher and taketh it to him will i give achsah my 
daughter to wife 
and othniel the son of kenaz caleb s younger brother took it 
and he gave him achsah his daughter to wife 
and it came to pass when she came to him that she moved him to 
ask of her father a field and she lighted from off her ass and caleb 
said unto her what wilt thou and she said unto him give me a 
blessing for thou hast given me a south land give me also springs of 
water and caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs 
and the children of the kenite moses father in law went up out 
of the city of palm trees with the children of judah into the 
wilderness of judah which lieth in the south of arad and they went 
and dwelt among the people 
and judah went with simeon his brother and they slew the 
canaanites that inhabited zephath and utterly destroyed it and the 
name of the city was called hormah 
also judah took gaza with the coast thereof and askelon with the 
coast thereof and ekron with the coast thereof 
and the lord was with judah and he drave out the inhabitants of 
the mountain but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley 
because they had chariots of iron 
and they gave hebron unto caleb as moses said and he expelled 
thence the three sons of anak 
and the children of benjamin did not drive out the jebusites that 
inhabited jerusalem but the jebusites dwell with the children of 
benjamin in jerusalem unto this day 
and the house of joseph they also went up against bethel and 
the lord was with them 
and the house of joseph sent to descry bethel now the name of 
the city before was luz and the spies saw a man come forth out 
of the city and they said unto him shew us we pray thee the 
entrance into the city and we will shew thee mercy 
and when he shewed them the entrance into the city they smote 
the city with the edge of the sword but they let go the man and all 
his family 
and the man went into the land of the hittites and built a city 
and called the name thereof luz which is the name thereof unto this 
day 
neither did manasseh drive out the inhabitants of bethshean and 
her towns nor taanach and her towns nor the inhabitants of dor and 
her towns nor the inhabitants of ibleam and her towns nor the 
inhabitants of megiddo and her towns but the canaanites would dwell 
in that land 
and it came to pass when israel was strong that they put the 
canaanites to tribute and did not utterly drive them out 
neither did ephraim drive out the canaanites that dwelt in gezer 
but the canaanites dwelt in gezer among them 
neither did zebulun drive out the inhabitants of kitron nor the 
inhabitants of nahalol but the canaanites dwelt among them and 
became tributaries 
neither did asher drive out the inhabitants of accho nor the 
inhabitants of zidon nor of ahlab nor of achzib nor of helbah nor 
of aphik nor of rehob but the asherites dwelt among the 
canaanites the inhabitants of the land for they did not drive them 
out 
neither did naphtali drive out the inhabitants of bethshemesh 
nor the inhabitants of bethanath but he dwelt among the canaanites 
the inhabitants of the land nevertheless the inhabitants of 
bethshemesh and of bethanath became tributaries unto them 
and the amorites forced the children of dan into the mountain 
for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley but 
the amorites would dwell in mount here is in aijalon and in shaalbim 
yet the hand of the house of joseph prevailed so that they became 
tributaries 
and the coast of the amorites was from the going up to akrabbim 
from the rock and upward 
and an angel of the lord came up from gilgal to bochim and said 
i made you to go up out of egypt and have brought you unto the land 
which i sware unto your fathers and i said i will never break my 
covenant with you 
and ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land ye 
shall throw down their altars but ye have not obeyed my voice why 
have ye done this wherefore i also said i will not drive them 
out from before you but they shall be as thorns in your sides and 
their gods shall be a snare unto you 
and it came to pass when the angel of the lord spake these words 
unto all the children of israel that the people lifted up their 
voice and wept 
and they called the name of that place bochim and they sacrificed 
there unto the lord 
and when joshua had let the people go the children of israel went 
every man unto his inheritance to possess the land 
and the people served the lord all the days of joshua and all the 
days of the elders that outlived joshua who had seen all the great 
works of the lord that he did for israel 
and joshua the son of nun the servant of the lord died being an 
hundred and ten years old 
and they buried him in the border of his inheritance in 
timnathheres in the mount of ephraim on the north side of the hill 
gaash 
and also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers 
and there arose another generation after them which knew not the 
lord nor yet the works which he had done for israel 
and the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord and 
served baalim and they forsook the lord god of their fathers 
which brought them out of the land of egypt and followed other gods 
of the gods of the people that were round about them and bowed 
themselves unto them and provoked the lord to anger 
and they forsook the lord and served baal and ashtaroth 
and the anger of the lord was hot against israel and he 
delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them and he 
sold them into the hands of their enemies round about so that they 
could not any longer stand before their enemies 
whithersoever they went out the hand of the lord was against 
them for evil as the lord had said and as the lord had sworn unto 
them and they were greatly distressed 
nevertheless the lord raised up judges which delivered them out 
of the hand of those that spoiled them 
and yet they would not hearken unto their judges but they went a 
whoring after other gods and bowed themselves unto them they turned 
quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in obeying the 
commandments of the lord but they did not so 
and when the lord raised them up judges then the lord was with 
the judge and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the 
days of the judge for it repented the lord because of their groanings 
by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them 
and it came to pass when the judge was dead that they returned 
and corrupted themselves more than their fathers in following other 
gods to serve them and to bow down unto them they ceased not from 
their own doings nor from their stubborn way 
and the anger of the lord was hot against israel and he said 
because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which i 
commanded their fathers and have not hearkened unto my voice i 
also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations 
which joshua left when he died that through them i may prove 
israel whether they will keep the way of the lord to walk therein as 
their fathers did keep it or not 
therefore the lord left those nations without driving them out 
hastily neither delivered he them into the hand of joshua 
now these are the nations which the lord left to prove israel by 
them even as many of israel as had not known all the wars of canaan 
only that the generations of the children of israel might know to 
teach them war at the least such as before knew nothing thereof 
namely five lords of the philistines and all the canaanites and the 
sidonians and the hivites that dwelt in mount lebanon from mount 
baalhermon unto the entering in of hamath 
and they were to prove israel by them to know whether they would 
hearken unto the commandments of the lord which he commanded their 
fathers by the hand of moses 
and the children of israel dwelt among the canaanites hittites 
and amorites and perizzites and hivites and jebusites and they 
took their daughters to be their wives and gave their daughters to 
their sons and served their gods 
and the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord and 
forgat the lord their god and served baalim and the groves 
therefore the anger of the lord was hot against israel and he 
sold them into the hand of chushanrishathaim king of mesopotamia and 
the children of israel served chushanrishathaim eight years 
and when the children of israel cried unto the lord the lord 
raised up a deliverer to the children of israel who delivered them 
even othniel the son of kenaz caleb s younger brother 
and the spirit of the lord came upon him and he judged israel 
and went out to war and the lord delivered chushanrishathaim king of 
mesopotamia into his hand and his hand prevailed against 
chushanrishathaim 
and the land had rest forty years and othniel the son of kenaz 
died 
and the children of israel did evil again in the sight of the 
lord and the lord strengthened eglon the king of moab against israel 
because they had done evil in the sight of the lord 
and he gathered unto him the children of ammon and amalek and 
went and smote israel and possessed the city of palm trees 
so the children of israel served eglon the king of moab eighteen 
years 
but when the children of israel cried unto the lord the lord 
raised them up a deliverer ehud the son of gera a benjamite a man 
lefthanded and by him the children of israel sent a present unto 
eglon the king of moab 
but ehud made him a dagger which had two edges of a cubit 
length and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh 
and he brought the present unto eglon king of moab and eglon was 
a very fat man 
and when he had made an end to offer the present he sent away 
the people that bare the present 
but he himself turned again from the quarries that were by 
gilgal and said i have a secret errand unto thee o king who said 
keep silence and all that stood by him went out from him 
and ehud came unto him and he was sitting in a summer parlour 
which he had for himself alone and ehud said i have a message from 
god unto thee 
and he arose out of his seat 
and ehud put forth his left hand and took the dagger from his 
right thigh and thrust it into his belly and the haft also went 
in after the blade and the fat closed upon the blade so that he 
could not draw the dagger out of his belly and the dirt came out 
then ehud went forth through the porch and shut the doors of the 
parlour upon him and locked them 
when he was gone out his servants came and when they saw that 
behold the doors of the parlour were locked they said surely he 
covereth his feet in his summer chamber 
and they tarried till they were ashamed and behold he opened 
not the doors of the parlour therefore they took a key and opened 
them and behold their lord was fallen down dead on the earth 
and ehud escaped while they tarried and passed beyond the 
quarries and escaped unto seirath 
and it came to pass when he was come that he blew a trumpet in 
the mountain of ephraim and the children of israel went down with him 
from the mount and he before them 
and he said unto them follow after me for the lord hath 
delivered your enemies the moabites into your hand and they went down 
after him and took the fords of jordan toward moab and suffered not 
a man to pass over 
and they slew of moab at that time about ten thousand men all 
lusty and all men of valour and there escaped not a man 
so moab was subdued that day under the hand of israel and the 
land had rest fourscore years 
and after him was shamgar the son of anath which slew of the 
philistines six hundred men with an ox goad and he also delivered 
israel 
and the children of israel again did evil in the sight of the 
lord when ehud was dead 
and the lord sold them into the hand of jabin king of canaan that 
reigned in hazor the captain of whose host was sisera which dwelt in 
harosheth of the gentiles 
and the children of israel cried unto the lord for he had nine 
hundred chariots of iron and twenty years he mightily oppressed the 
children of israel 
and deborah a prophetess the wife of lapidoth she judged israel 
at that time 
and she dwelt under the palm tree of deborah between ramah and 
bethel in mount ephraim and the children of israel came up to her for 
judgment 
and she sent and called barak the son of abinoam out of 
kedeshnaphtali and said unto him hath not the lord god of israel 
commanded saying go and draw toward mount tabor and take with thee 
ten thousand men of the children of naphtali and of the children of 
zebulun and i will draw unto thee to the river kishon sisera 
the captain of jabin s army with his chariots and his multitude and 
i will deliver him into thine hand 
and barak said unto her if thou wilt go with me then i will go 
but if thou wilt not go with me then i will not go 
and she said i will surely go with thee notwithstanding the 
journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour for the lord 
shall sell sisera into the hand of a woman and deborah arose and 
went with barak to kedesh 
and barak called zebulun and naphtali to kedesh and he went up 
with ten thousand men at his feet and deborah went up with him 
now heber the kenite which was of the children of hobab the 
father in law of moses had severed himself from the kenites and 
pitched his tent unto the plain of zaanaim which is by kedesh 
and they shewed sisera that barak the son of abinoam was gone up 
to mount tabor 
and sisera gathered together all his chariots even nine hundred 
chariots of iron and all the people that were with him from 
harosheth of the gentiles unto the river of kishon 
and deborah said unto barak up for this is the day in which the 
lord hath delivered sisera into thine hand is not the lord gone out 
before thee so barak went down from mount tabor and ten thousand men 
after him 
and the lord discomfited sisera and all his chariots and all 
his host with the edge of the sword before barak so that sisera 
lighted down off his chariot and fled away on his feet 
but barak pursued after the chariots and after the host unto 
harosheth of the gentiles and all the host of sisera fell upon the 
edge of the sword and there was not a man left 
howbeit sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of jael the wife 
of heber the kenite for there was peace between jabin the king of 
hazor and the house of heber the kenite 
and jael went out to meet sisera and said unto him turn in my 
lord turn in to me fear not and when he had turned in unto her into 
the tent she covered him with a mantle 
and he said unto her give me i pray thee a little water to 
drink for i am thirsty and she opened a bottle of milk and gave him 
drink and covered him 
again he said unto her stand in the door of the tent and it 
shall be when any man doth come and enquire of thee and say is 
there any man here that thou shalt say no 
then jael heber s wife took a nail of the tent and took an 
hammer in her hand and went softly unto him and smote the nail into 
his temples and fastened it into the ground for he was fast asleep 
and weary so he died 
and behold as barak pursued sisera jael came out to meet him 
and said unto him come and i will shew thee the man whom thou 
seekest and when he came into her tent behold sisera lay dead and 
the nail was in his temples 
so god subdued on that day jabin the king of canaan before the 
children of israel 
and the hand of the children of israel prospered and prevailed 
against jabin the king of canaan until they had destroyed jabin king 
of canaan 
then sang deborah and barak the son of abinoam on that day 
saying praise ye the lord for the avenging of israel when the 
people willingly offered themselves 
hear o ye kings give ear o ye princes i even i will sing 
unto the lord i will sing praise to the lord god of israel 
lord when thou wentest out of seir when thou marchedst out of 
the field of edom the earth trembled and the heavens dropped the 
clouds also dropped water 
the mountains melted from before the lord even that sinai from 
before the lord god of israel 
in the days of shamgar the son of anath in the days of jael the 
highways were unoccupied and the travellers walked through byways 
the inhabitants of the villages ceased they ceased in israel 
until that i deborah arose that i arose a mother in israel 
they chose new gods then was war in the gates was there a shield 
or spear seen among forty thousand in israel my heart is toward 
the governors of israel that offered themselves willingly among the 
people bless ye the lord 
speak ye that ride on white asses ye that sit in judgment and 
walk by the way 
they that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places 
of drawing water there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the 
lord even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages 
in israel then shall the people of the lord go down to the gates 
awake awake deborah awake awake utter a song arise barak 
and lead thy captivity captive thou son of abinoam 
then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles 
among the people the lord made me have dominion over the mighty 
out of ephraim was there a root of them against amalek after 
thee benjamin among thy people out of machir came down governors 
and out of zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer 
and the princes of issachar were with deborah even issachar and 
also barak he was sent on foot into the valley for the divisions of 
reuben there were great thoughts of heart 
why abodest thou among the sheepfolds to hear the bleatings of 
the flocks for the divisions of reuben there were great searchings of 
heart 
gilead abode beyond jordan and why did dan remain in ships 
asher continued on the sea shore and abode in his breaches 
zebulun and naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives 
unto the death in the high places of the field 
the kings came and fought then fought the kings of canaan in 
taanach by the waters of megiddo they took no gain of money 
they fought from heaven the stars in their courses fought 
against sisera 
the river of kishon swept them away that ancient river the 
river kishon o my soul thou hast trodden down strength 
then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings 
the pransings of their mighty ones 
curse ye meroz said the angel of the lord curse ye bitterly the 
inhabitants thereof because they came not to the help of the lord to 
the help of the lord against the mighty 
blessed above women shall jael the wife of heber the kenite be 
blessed shall she be above women in the tent 
he asked water and she gave him milk she brought forth butter 
in a lordly dish 
she put her hand to the nail and her right hand to the workmen s 
hammer and with the hammer she smote sisera she smote off his head 
when she had pierced and stricken through his temples 
at her feet he bowed he fell he lay down at her feet he bowed 
he fell where he bowed there he fell down dead 
the mother of sisera looked out at a window and cried through 
the lattice why is his chariot so long in coming why tarry the 
wheels of his chariots her wise ladies answered her yea she 
returned answer to herself have they not sped have they not 
divided the prey to every man a damsel or two to sisera a prey of 
divers colours a prey of divers colours of needlework of divers 
colours of needlework on both sides meet for the necks of them that 
take the spoil so let all thine enemies perish o lord but let 
them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might and 
the land had rest forty years 
and the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord and 
the lord delivered them into the hand of midian seven years 
and the hand of midian prevailed against israel and because of 
the midianites the children of israel made them the dens which are in 
the mountains and caves and strong holds 
and so it was when israel had sown that the midianites came up 
and the amalekites and the children of the east even they came up 
against them and they encamped against them and destroyed the 
increase of the earth till thou come unto gaza and left no 
sustenance for israel neither sheep nor ox nor ass 
for they came up with their cattle and their tents and they came 
as grasshoppers for multitude for both they and their camels were 
without number and they entered into the land to destroy it 
and israel was greatly impoverished because of the midianites and 
the children of israel cried unto the lord 
and it came to pass when the children of israel cried unto the 
lord because of the midianites that the lord sent a prophet unto 
the children of israel which said unto them thus saith the lord god 
of israel i brought you up from egypt and brought you forth out of 
the house of bondage and i delivered you out of the hand of the 
egyptians and out of the hand of all that oppressed you and drave 
them out from before you and gave you their land and i said 
unto you i am the lord your god fear not the gods of the amorites 
in whose land ye dwell but ye have not obeyed my voice 
and there came an angel of the lord and sat under an oak which 
was in ophrah that pertained unto joash the abiezrite and his son 
gideon threshed wheat by the winepress to hide it from the 
midianites 
and the angel of the lord appeared unto him and said unto him 
the lord is with thee thou mighty man of valour 
and gideon said unto him oh my lord if the lord be with us why 
then is all this befallen us and where be all his miracles which our 
fathers told us of saying did not the lord bring us up from egypt 
but now the lord hath forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of 
the midianites 
and the lord looked upon him and said go in this thy might and 
thou shalt save israel from the hand of the midianites have not i 
sent thee and he said unto him oh my lord wherewith shall i 
save israel behold my family is poor in manasseh and i am the 
least in my father s house 
and the lord said unto him surely i will be with thee and thou 
shalt smite the midianites as one man 
and he said unto him if now i have found grace in thy sight 
then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me 
depart not hence i pray thee until i come unto thee and bring 
forth my present and set it before thee and he said i will tarry 
until thou come again 
and gideon went in and made ready a kid and unleavened cakes of 
an ephah of flour the flesh he put in a basket and he put the broth 
in a pot and brought it out unto him under the oak and presented it 
and the angel of god said unto him take the flesh and the 
unleavened cakes and lay them upon this rock and pour out the broth 
and he did so 
then the angel of the lord put forth the end of the staff that 
was in his hand and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes and 
there rose up fire out of the rock and consumed the flesh and the 
unleavened cakes then the angel of the lord departed out of his 
sight 
and when gideon perceived that he was an angel of the lord 
gideon said alas o lord god for because i have seen an angel of the 
lord face to face 
and the lord said unto him peace be unto thee fear not thou 
shalt not die 
then gideon built an altar there unto the lord and called it 
jehovahshalom unto this day it is yet in ophrah of the abiezrites 
and it came to pass the same night that the lord said unto him 
take thy father s young bullock even the second bullock of seven 
years old and throw down the altar of baal that thy father hath and 
cut down the grove that is by it and build an altar unto the 
lord thy god upon the top of this rock in the ordered place and take 
the second bullock and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the 
grove which thou shalt cut down 
then gideon took ten men of his servants and did as the lord had 
said unto him and so it was because he feared his father s 
household and the men of the city that he could not do it by day 
that he did it by night 
and when the men of the city arose early in the morning behold 
the altar of baal was cast down and the grove was cut down that was 
by it and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was 
built 
and they said one to another who hath done this thing and when 
they enquired and asked they said gideon the son of joash hath done 
this thing 
then the men of the city said unto joash bring out thy son that 
he may die because he hath cast down the altar of baal and because 
he hath cut down the grove that was by it 
and joash said unto all that stood against him will ye plead for 
baal will ye save him he that will plead for him let him be put to 
death whilst it is yet morning if he be a god let him plead for 
himself because one hath cast down his altar 
therefore on that day he called him jerubbaal saying let baal 
plead against him because he hath thrown down his altar 
then all the midianites and the amalekites and the children of 
the east were gathered together and went over and pitched in the 
valley of jezreel 
but the spirit of the lord came upon gideon and he blew a 
trumpet and abiezer was gathered after him 
and he sent messengers throughout all manasseh who also was 
gathered after him and he sent messengers unto asher and unto 
zebulun and unto naphtali and they came up to meet them 
and gideon said unto god if thou wilt save israel by mine hand 
as thou hast said behold i will put a fleece of wool in the 
floor and if the dew be on the fleece only and it be dry upon all 
the earth beside then shall i know that thou wilt save israel by mine 
hand as thou hast said 
and it was so for he rose up early on the morrow and thrust the 
fleece together and wringed the dew out of the fleece a bowl full of 
water 
and gideon said unto god let not thine anger be hot against me 
and i will speak but this once let me prove i pray thee but this 
once with the fleece let it now be dry only upon the fleece and upon 
all the ground let there be dew 
and god did so that night for it was dry upon the fleece only 
and there was dew on all the ground 
then jerubbaal who is gideon and all the people that were with 
him rose up early and pitched beside the well of harod so that the 
host of the midianites were on the north side of them by the hill of 
moreh in the valley 
and the lord said unto gideon the people that are with thee are 
too many for me to give the midianites into their hands lest israel 
vaunt themselves against me saying mine own hand hath saved me 
now therefore go to proclaim in the ears of the people saying 
whosoever is fearful and afraid let him return and depart early from 
mount gilead and there returned of the people twenty and two 
thousand and there remained ten thousand 
and the lord said unto gideon the people are yet too many bring 
them down unto the water and i will try them for thee there and it 
shall be that of whom i say unto thee this shall go with thee the 
same shall go with thee and of whomsoever i say unto thee this shall 
not go with thee the same shall not go 
so he brought down the people unto the water and the lord said 
unto gideon every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue as a 
dog lappeth him shalt thou set by himself likewise every one that 
boweth down upon his knees to drink 
and the number of them that lapped putting their hand to their 
mouth were three hundred men but all the rest of the people bowed 
down upon their knees to drink water 
and the lord said unto gideon by the three hundred men that 
lapped will i save you and deliver the midianites into thine hand 
and let all the other people go every man unto his place 
so the people took victuals in their hand and their trumpets and 
he sent all the rest of israel every man unto his tent and retained 
those three hundred men and the host of midian was beneath him in the 
valley 
and it came to pass the same night that the lord said unto him 
arise get thee down unto the host for i have delivered it into thine 
hand 
but if thou fear to go down go thou with phurah thy servant down 
to the host and thou shalt hear what they say and afterward 
shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host then went 
he down with phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that 
were in the host 
and the midianites and the amalekites and all the children of the 
east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude and 
their camels were without number as the sand by the sea side for 
multitude 
and when gideon was come behold there was a man that told a 
dream unto his fellow and said behold i dreamed a dream and lo a 
cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of midian and came unto a 
tent and smote it that it fell and overturned it that the tent lay 
along 
and his fellow answered and said this is nothing else save the 
sword of gideon the son of joash a man of israel for into his hand 
hath god delivered midian and all the host 
and it was so when gideon heard the telling of the dream and 
the interpretation thereof that he worshipped and returned into the 
host of israel and said arise for the lord hath delivered into your 
hand the host of midian 
and he divided the three hundred men into three companies and he 
put a trumpet in every man s hand with empty pitchers and lamps 
within the pitchers 
and he said unto them look on me and do likewise and behold 
when i come to the outside of the camp it shall be that as i do so 
shall ye do 
when i blow with a trumpet i and all that are with me then blow 
ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp and say the sword 
of the lord and of gideon 
so gideon and the hundred men that were with him came unto the 
outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch and they had 
but newly set the watch and they blew the trumpets and brake the 
pitchers that were in their hands 
and the three companies blew the trumpets and brake the 
pitchers and held the lamps in their left hands and the trumpets in 
their right hands to blow withal and they cried the sword of the 
lord and of gideon 
and they stood every man in his place round about the camp and 
all the host ran and cried and fled 
and the three hundred blew the trumpets and the lord set every 
man s sword against his fellow even throughout all the host and the 
host fled to bethshittah in zererath and to the border of 
abelmeholah unto tabbath 
and the men of israel gathered themselves together out of 
naphtali and out of asher and out of all manasseh and pursued after 
the midianites 
and gideon sent messengers throughout all mount ephraim saying 
come down against the midianites and take before them the waters unto 
bethbarah and jordan then all the men of ephraim gathered themselves 
together and took the waters unto bethbarah and jordan 
and they took two princes of the midianites oreb and zeeb and 
they slew oreb upon the rock oreb and zeeb they slew at the winepress 
of zeeb and pursued midian and brought the heads of oreb and zeeb to 
gideon on the other side jordan 
and the men of ephraim said unto him why hast thou served us 
thus that thou calledst us not when thou wentest to fight with the 
midianites and they did chide with him sharply 
and he said unto them what have i done now in comparison of you 
is not the gleaning of the grapes of ephraim better than the vintage 
of abiezer god hath delivered into your hands the princes of 
midian oreb and zeeb and what was i able to do in comparison of you 
then their anger was abated toward him when he had said that 
and gideon came to jordan and passed over he and the three 
hundred men that were with him faint yet pursuing them 
and he said unto the men of succoth give i pray you loaves of 
bread unto the people that follow me for they be faint and i am 
pursuing after zebah and zalmunna kings of midian 
and the princes of succoth said are the hands of zebah and 
zalmunna now in thine hand that we should give bread unto thine army 
and gideon said therefore when the lord hath delivered zebah and 
zalmunna into mine hand then i will tear your flesh with the thorns 
of the wilderness and with briers 
and he went up thence to penuel and spake unto them likewise and 
the men of penuel answered him as the men of succoth had answered him 
and he spake also unto the men of penuel saying when i come 
again in peace i will break down this tower 
now zebah and zalmunna were in karkor and their hosts with them 
about fifteen thousand men all that were left of all the hosts of the 
children of the east for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand 
men that drew sword 
and gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the 
east of nobah and jogbehah and smote the host for the host was 
secure 
and when zebah and zalmunna fled he pursued after them and took 
the two kings of midian zebah and zalmunna and discomfited all the 
host 
and gideon the son of joash returned from battle before the sun 
was up and caught a young man of the men of succoth and 
enquired of him and he described unto him the princes of succoth and 
the elders thereof even threescore and seventeen men 
and he came unto the men of succoth and said behold zebah and 
zalmunna with whom ye did upbraid me saying are the hands of zebah 
and zalmunna now in thine hand that we should give bread unto thy men 
that are weary and he took the elders of the city and thorns 
of the wilderness and briers and with them he taught the men of 
succoth 
and he beat down the tower of penuel and slew the men of the 
city 
then said he unto zebah and zalmunna what manner of men were 
they whom ye slew at tabor and they answered as thou art so were 
they each one resembled the children of a king 
and he said they were my brethren even the sons of my mother 
as the lord liveth if ye had saved them alive i would not slay you 
and he said unto jether his firstborn up and slay them but the 
youth drew not his sword for he feared because he was yet a youth 
then zebah and zalmunna said rise thou and fall upon us for as 
the man is so is his strength and gideon arose and slew zebah and 
zalmunna and took away the ornaments that were on their camels 
necks 
then the men of israel said unto gideon rule thou over us both 
thou and thy son and thy son s son also for thou hast delivered us 
from the hand of midian 
and gideon said unto them i will not rule over you neither 
shall my son rule over you the lord shall rule over you 
and gideon said unto them i would desire a request of you that 
ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey for they had 
golden earrings because they were ishmaelites and they 
answered we will willingly give them and they spread a garment and 
did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey 
and the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a 
thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold beside ornaments and 
collars and purple raiment that was on the kings of midian and 
beside the chains that were about their camels necks 
and gideon made an ephod thereof and put it in his city even in 
ophrah and all israel went thither a whoring after it which thing 
became a snare unto gideon and to his house 
thus was midian subdued before the children of israel so that 
they lifted up their heads no more and the country was in quietness 
forty years in the days of gideon 
and jerubbaal the son of joash went and dwelt in his own house 
and gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten for 
he had many wives 
and his concubine that was in shechem she also bare him a son 
whose name he called abimelech 
and gideon the son of joash died in a good old age and was 
buried in the sepulchre of joash his father in ophrah of the 
abiezrites 
and it came to pass as soon as gideon was dead that the 
children of israel turned again and went a whoring after baalim and 
made baalberith their god 
and the children of israel remembered not the lord their god who 
had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every 
side neither shewed they kindness to the house of jerubbaal 
namely gideon according to all the goodness which he had shewed unto 
israel 
and abimelech the son of jerubbaal went to shechem unto his 
mother s brethren and communed with them and with all the family of 
the house of his mother s father saying speak i pray you in 
the ears of all the men of shechem whether is better for you either 
that all the sons of jerubbaal which are threescore and ten persons 
reign over you or that one reign over you remember also that i am 
your bone and your flesh 
and his mother s brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men 
of shechem all these words and their hearts inclined to follow 
abimelech for they said he is our brother 
and they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the 
house of baalberith wherewith abimelech hired vain and light persons 
which followed him 
and he went unto his father s house at ophrah and slew his 
brethren the sons of jerubbaal being threescore and ten persons upon 
one stone notwithstanding yet jotham the youngest son of jerubbaal 
was left for he hid himself 
and all the men of shechem gathered together and all the house of 
millo and went and made abimelech king by the plain of the pillar 
that was in shechem 
and when they told it to jotham he went and stood in the top of 
mount gerizim and lifted up his voice and cried and said unto them 
hearken unto me ye men of shechem that god may hearken unto you 
the trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them and 
they said unto the olive tree reign thou over us 
but the olive tree said unto them should i leave my fatness 
wherewith by me they honour god and man and go to be promoted over 
the trees and the trees said to the fig tree come thou and 
reign over us 
but the fig tree said unto them should i forsake my sweetness 
and my good fruit and go to be promoted over the trees then 
said the trees unto the vine come thou and reign over us 
and the vine said unto them should i leave my wine which 
cheereth god and man and go to be promoted over the trees then 
said all the trees unto the bramble come thou and reign over us 
and the bramble said unto the trees if in truth ye anoint me 
king over you then come and put your trust in my shadow and if not 
let fire come out of the bramble and devour the cedars of lebanon 
now therefore if ye have done truly and sincerely in that ye 
have made abimelech king and if ye have dealt well with jerubbaal and 
his house and have done unto him according to the deserving of his 
hands for my father fought for you and adventured his life 
far and delivered you out of the hand of midian and ye are 
risen up against my father s house this day and have slain his sons 
threescore and ten persons upon one stone and have made abimelech 
the son of his maidservant king over the men of shechem because he 
is your brother if ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with 
jerubbaal and with his house this day then rejoice ye in abimelech 
and let him also rejoice in you but if not let fire come out 
from abimelech and devour the men of shechem and the house of millo 
and let fire come out from the men of shechem and from the house of 
millo and devour abimelech 
and jotham ran away and fled and went to beer and dwelt there 
for fear of abimelech his brother 
when abimelech had reigned three years over israel then god 
sent an evil spirit between abimelech and the men of shechem and the 
men of shechem dealt treacherously with abimelech that the 
cruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of jerubbaal might come 
and their blood be laid upon abimelech their brother which slew them 
and upon the men of shechem which aided him in the killing of his 
brethren 
and the men of shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of 
the mountains and they robbed all that came along that way by them 
and it was told abimelech 
and gaal the son of ebed came with his brethren and went over to 
shechem and the men of shechem put their confidence in him 
and they went out into the fields and gathered their vineyards 
and trode the grapes and made merry and went into the house of their 
god and did eat and drink and cursed abimelech 
and gaal the son of ebed said who is abimelech and who is 
shechem that we should serve him is not he the son of jerubbaal and 
zebul his officer serve the men of hamor the father of shechem for 
why should we serve him and would to god this people were under 
my hand then would i remove abimelech and he said to abimelech 
increase thine army and come out 
and when zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of gaal the 
son of ebed his anger was kindled 
and he sent messengers unto abimelech privily saying behold 
gaal the son of ebed and his brethren be come to shechem and behold 
they fortify the city against thee 
now therefore up by night thou and the people that is with thee 
and lie in wait in the field and it shall be that in the 
morning as soon as the sun is up thou shalt rise early and set upon 
the city and behold when he and the people that is with him come 
out against thee then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find 
occasion 
and abimelech rose up and all the people that were with him by 
night and they laid wait against shechem in four companies 
and gaal the son of ebed went out and stood in the entering of 
the gate of the city and abimelech rose up and the people that were 
with him from lying in wait 
and when gaal saw the people he said to zebul behold there 
come people down from the top of the mountains and zebul said unto 
him thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men 
and gaal spake again and said see there come people down by the 
middle of the land and another company come along by the plain of 
meonenim 
then said zebul unto him where is now thy mouth wherewith thou 
saidst who is abimelech that we should serve him is not this the 
people that thou hast despised go out i pray now and fight with 
them 
and gaal went out before the men of shechem and fought with 
abimelech 
and abimelech chased him and he fled before him and many were 
overthrown and wounded even unto the entering of the gate 
and abimelech dwelt at arumah and zebul thrust out gaal and his 
brethren that they should not dwell in shechem 
and it came to pass on the morrow that the people went out into 
the field and they told abimelech 
and he took the people and divided them into three companies 
and laid wait in the field and looked and behold the people were 
come forth out of the city and he rose up against them and smote 
them 
and abimelech and the company that was with him rushed forward 
and stood in the entering of the gate of the city and the two other 
companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields and slew 
them 
and abimelech fought against the city all that day and he took 
the city and slew the people that was therein and beat down the 
city and sowed it with salt 
and when all the men of the tower of shechem heard that they 
entered into an hold of the house of the god berith 
and it was told abimelech that all the men of the tower of 
shechem were gathered together 
and abimelech gat him up to mount zalmon he and all the people 
that were with him and abimelech took an axe in his hand and cut 
down a bough from the trees and took it and laid it on his shoulder 
and said unto the people that were with him what ye have seen me do 
make haste and do as i have done 
and all the people likewise cut down every man his bough and 
followed abimelech and put them to the hold and set the hold on fire 
upon them so that all the men of the tower of shechem died also 
about a thousand men and women 
then went abimelech to thebez and encamped against thebez and 
took it 
but there was a strong tower within the city and thither fled 
all the men and women and all they of the city and shut it to them 
and gat them up to the top of the tower 
and abimelech came unto the tower and fought against it and 
went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire 
and a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon abimelech s 
head and all to brake his skull 
then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer and 
said unto him draw thy sword and slay me that men say not of me a 
women slew him and his young man thrust him through and he died 
and when the men of israel saw that abimelech was dead they 
departed every man unto his place 
thus god rendered the wickedness of abimelech which he did unto 
his father in slaying his seventy brethren and all the evil of 
the men of shechem did god render upon their heads and upon them came 
the curse of jotham the son of jerubbaal 
and after abimelech there arose to defend israel tola the son of 
puah the son of dodo a man of issachar and he dwelt in shamir in 
mount ephraim 
and he judged israel twenty and three years and died and was 
buried in shamir 
and after him arose jair a gileadite and judged israel twenty 
and two years 
and he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts and they 
had thirty cities which are called havothjair unto this day which 
are in the land of gilead 
and jair died and was buried in camon 
and the children of israel did evil again in the sight of the 
lord and served baalim and ashtaroth and the gods of syria and the 
gods of zidon and the gods of moab and the gods of the children of 
ammon and the gods of the philistines and forsook the lord and 
served not him 
and the anger of the lord was hot against israel and he sold 
them into the hands of the philistines and into the hands of the 
children of ammon 
and that year they vexed and oppressed the children of israel 
eighteen years all the children of israel that were on the other side 
jordan in the land of the amorites which is in gilead 
moreover the children of ammon passed over jordan to fight also 
against judah and against benjamin and against the house of ephraim 
so that israel was sore distressed 
and the children of israel cried unto the lord saying we have 
sinned against thee both because we have forsaken our god and also 
served baalim 
and the lord said unto the children of israel did not i deliver 
you from the egyptians and from the amorites from the children of 
ammon and from the philistines the zidonians also and the 
amalekites and the maonites did oppress you and ye cried to me and 
i delivered you out of their hand 
yet ye have forsaken me and served other gods wherefore i will 
deliver you no more 
go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen let them deliver 
you in the time of your tribulation 
and the children of israel said unto the lord we have sinned 
do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee deliver us only we 
pray thee this day 
and they put away the strange gods from among them and served 
the lord and his soul was grieved for the misery of israel 
then the children of ammon were gathered together and encamped 
in gilead and the children of israel assembled themselves together 
and encamped in mizpeh 
and the people and princes of gilead said one to another what 
man is he that will begin to fight against the children of ammon he 
shall be head over all the inhabitants of gilead 
now jephthah the gileadite was a mighty man of valour and he was 
the son of an harlot and gilead begat jephthah 
and gilead s wife bare him sons and his wife s sons grew up and 
they thrust out jephthah and said unto him thou shalt not inherit in 
our father s house for thou art the son of a strange woman 
then jephthah fled from his brethren and dwelt in the land of 
tob and there were gathered vain men to jephthah and went out with 
him 
and it came to pass in process of time that the children of 
ammon made war against israel 
and it was so that when the children of ammon made war against 
israel the elders of gilead went to fetch jephthah out of the land of 
tob and they said unto jephthah come and be our captain that 
we may fight with the children of ammon 
and jephthah said unto the elders of gilead did not ye hate me 
and expel me out of my father s house and why are ye come unto me now 
when ye are in distress and the elders of gilead said unto 
jephthah therefore we turn again to thee now that thou mayest go 
with us and fight against the children of ammon and be our head over 
all the inhabitants of gilead 
and jephthah said unto the elders of gilead if ye bring me home 
again to fight against the children of ammon and the lord deliver 
them before me shall i be your head and the elders of gilead 
said unto jephthah the lord be witness between us if we do not so 
according to thy words 
then jephthah went with the elders of gilead and the people 
made him head and captain over them and jephthah uttered all his 
words before the lord in mizpeh 
and jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of 
ammon saying what hast thou to do with me that thou art come 
against me to fight in my land and the king of the children of 
ammon answered unto the messengers of jephthah because israel took 
away my land when they came up out of egypt from arnon even unto 
jabbok and unto jordan now therefore restore those lands again 
peaceably 
and jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children 
of ammon and said unto him thus saith jephthah israel took 
not away the land of moab nor the land of the children of ammon 
but when israel came up from egypt and walked through the 
wilderness unto the red sea and came to kadesh then israel 
sent messengers unto the king of edom saying let me i pray thee 
pass through thy land but the king of edom would not hearken thereto 
and in like manner they sent unto the king of moab but he would not 
consent and israel abode in kadesh 
then they went along through the wilderness and compassed the 
land of edom and the land of moab and came by the east side of the 
land of moab and pitched on the other side of arnon but came not 
within the border of moab for arnon was the border of moab 
and israel sent messengers unto sihon king of the amorites the 
king of heshbon and israel said unto him let us pass we pray thee 
through thy land into my place 
but sihon trusted not israel to pass through his coast but 
sihon gathered all his people together and pitched in jahaz and 
fought against israel 
and the lord god of israel delivered sihon and all his people 
into the hand of israel and they smote them so israel possessed all 
the land of the amorites the inhabitants of that country 
and they possessed all the coasts of the amorites from arnon 
even unto jabbok and from the wilderness even unto jordan 
so now the lord god of israel hath dispossessed the amorites 
from before his people israel and shouldest thou possess it 
wilt not thou possess that which chemosh thy god giveth thee to 
possess so whomsoever the lord our god shall drive out from before 
us them will we possess 
and now art thou any thing better than balak the son of zippor 
king of moab did he ever strive against israel or did he ever fight 
against them while israel dwelt in heshbon and her towns and 
in aroer and her towns and in all the cities that be along by the 
coasts of arnon three hundred years why therefore did ye not recover 
them within that time wherefore i have not sinned against 
thee but thou doest me wrong to war against me the lord the judge be 
judge this day between the children of israel and the children of 
ammon 
howbeit the king of the children of ammon hearkened not unto the 
words of jephthah which he sent him 
then the spirit of the lord came upon jephthah and he passed 
over gilead and manasseh and passed over mizpeh of gilead and from 
mizpeh of gilead he passed over unto the children of ammon 
and jephthah vowed a vow unto the lord and said if thou shalt 
without fail deliver the children of ammon into mine hands then 
it shall be that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to 
meet me when i return in peace from the children of ammon shall 
surely be the lord s and i will offer it up for a burnt offering 
so jephthah passed over unto the children of ammon to fight 
against them and the lord delivered them into his hands 
and he smote them from aroer even till thou come to minnith 
even twenty cities and unto the plain of the vineyards with a very 
great slaughter thus the children of ammon were subdued before the 
children of israel 
and jephthah came to mizpeh unto his house and behold his 
daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances and she 
was his only child beside her he had neither son nor daughter 
and it came to pass when he saw her that he rent his clothes 
and said alas my daughter thou hast brought me very low and thou 
art one of them that trouble me for i have opened my mouth unto the 
lord and i cannot go back 
and she said unto him my father if thou hast opened thy mouth 
unto the lord do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of 
thy mouth forasmuch as the lord hath taken vengeance for thee of 
thine enemies even of the children of ammon 
and she said unto her father let this thing be done for me let 
me alone two months that i may go up and down upon the mountains and 
bewail my virginity i and my fellows 
and he said go and he sent her away for two months and she 
went with her companions and bewailed her virginity upon the 
mountains 
and it came to pass at the end of two months that she returned 
unto her father who did with her according to his vow which he had 
vowed and she knew no man and it was a custom in israel that 
the daughters of israel went yearly to lament the daughter of jephthah 
the gileadite four days in a year 
and the men of ephraim gathered themselves together and went 
northward and said unto jephthah wherefore passedst thou over to 
fight against the children of ammon and didst not call us to go with 
thee we will burn thine house upon thee with fire 
and jephthah said unto them i and my people were at great strife 
with the children of ammon and when i called you ye delivered me not 
out of their hands 
and when i saw that ye delivered me not i put my life in my 
hands and passed over against the children of ammon and the lord 
delivered them into my hand wherefore then are ye come up unto me 
this day to fight against me then jephthah gathered together 
all the men of gilead and fought with ephraim and the men of gilead 
smote ephraim because they said ye gileadites are fugitives of 
ephraim among the ephraimites and among the manassites 
and the gileadites took the passages of jordan before the 
ephraimites and it was so that when those ephraimites which were 
escaped said let me go over that the men of gilead said unto him 
art thou an ephraimite if he said nay then said they unto him 
say now shibboleth and he said sibboleth for he could not frame to 
pronounce it right then they took him and slew him at the passages 
of jordan and there fell at that time of the ephraimites forty and 
two thousand 
and jephthah judged israel six years then died jephthah the 
gileadite and was buried in one of the cities of gilead 
and after him ibzan of bethlehem judged israel 
and he had thirty sons and thirty daughters whom he sent 
abroad and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons and he 
judged israel seven years 
then died ibzan and was buried at bethlehem 
and after him elon a zebulonite judged israel and he judged 
israel ten years 
and elon the zebulonite died and was buried in aijalon in the 
country of zebulun 
and after him abdon the son of hillel a pirathonite judged 
israel 
and he had forty sons and thirty nephews that rode on 
threescore and ten ass colts and he judged israel eight years 
and abdon the son of hillel the pirathonite died and was buried 
in pirathon in the land of ephraim in the mount of the amalekites 
and the children of israel did evil again in the sight of the 
lord and the lord delivered them into the hand of the philistines 
forty years 
and there was a certain man of zorah of the family of the 
danites whose name was manoah and his wife was barren and bare not 
and the angel of the lord appeared unto the woman and said unto 
her behold now thou art barren and bearest not but thou shalt 
conceive and bear a son 
now therefore beware i pray thee and drink not wine nor strong 
drink and eat not any unclean thing for lo thou shalt 
conceive and bear a son and no razor shall come on his head for the 
child shall be a nazarite unto god from the womb and he shall begin 
to deliver israel out of the hand of the philistines 
then the woman came and told her husband saying a man of god 
came unto me and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel 
of god very terrible but i asked him not whence he was neither told 
he me his name but he said unto me behold thou shalt conceive 
and bear a son and now drink no wine nor strong drink neither eat 
any unclean thing for the child shall be a nazarite to god from the 
womb to the day of his death 
then manoah intreated the lord and said o my lord let the man 
of god which thou didst send come again unto us and teach us what we 
shall do unto the child that shall be born 
and god hearkened to the voice of manoah and the angel of god 
came again unto the woman as she sat in the field but manoah her 
husband was not with her 
and the woman made haste and ran and shewed her husband and 
said unto him behold the man hath appeared unto me that came unto 
me the other day 
and manoah arose and went after his wife and came to the man 
and said unto him art thou the man that spakest unto the woman and 
he said i am 
and manoah said now let thy words come to pass how shall we 
order the child and how shall we do unto him and the angel of 
the lord said unto manoah of all that i said unto the woman let her 
beware 
she may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine neither 
let her drink wine or strong drink nor eat any unclean thing all 
that i commanded her let her observe 
and manoah said unto the angel of the lord i pray thee let us 
detain thee until we shall have made ready a kid for thee 
and the angel of the lord said unto manoah though thou detain 
me i will not eat of thy bread and if thou wilt offer a burnt 
offering thou must offer it unto the lord for manoah knew not that 
he was an angel of the lord 
and manoah said unto the angel of the lord what is thy name 
that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour and 
the angel of the lord said unto him why askest thou thus after my 
name seeing it is secret so manoah took a kid with a meat 
offering and offered it upon a rock unto the lord and the angel did 
wonderously and manoah and his wife looked on 
for it came to pass when the flame went up toward heaven from 
off the altar that the angel of the lord ascended in the flame of the 
altar and manoah and his wife looked on it and fell on their faces 
to the ground 
but the angel of the lord did no more appear to manoah and to 
his wife then manoah knew that he was an angel of the lord 
and manoah said unto his wife we shall surely die because we 
have seen god 
but his wife said unto him if the lord were pleased to kill us 
he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our 
hands neither would he have shewed us all these things nor would as 
at this time have told us such things as these 
and the woman bare a son and called his name samson and the 
child grew and the lord blessed him 
and the spirit of the lord began to move him at times in the 
camp of dan between zorah and eshtaol 
and samson went down to timnath and saw a woman in timnath of 
the daughters of the philistines 
and he came up and told his father and his mother and said i 
have seen a woman in timnath of the daughters of the philistines now 
therefore get her for me to wife 
then his father and his mother said unto him is there never a 
woman among the daughters of thy brethren or among all my people 
that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised philistines and 
samson said unto his father get her for me for she pleaseth me well 
but his father and his mother knew not that it was of the lord 
that he sought an occasion against the philistines for at that time 
the philistines had dominion over israel 
then went samson down and his father and his mother to timnath 
and came to the vineyards of timnath and behold a young lion roared 
against him 
and the spirit of the lord came mightily upon him and he rent 
him as he would have rent a kid and he had nothing in his hand but 
he told not his father or his mother what he had done 
and he went down and talked with the woman and she pleased 
samson well 
and after a time he returned to take her and he turned aside to 
see the carcase of the lion and behold there was a swarm of bees 
and honey in the carcase of the lion 
and he took thereof in his hands and went on eating and came to 
his father and mother and he gave them and they did eat but he told 
not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion 
so his father went down unto the woman and samson made there a 
feast for so used the young men to do 
and it came to pass when they saw him that they brought thirty 
companions to be with him 
and samson said unto them i will now put forth a riddle unto 
you if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the 
feast and find it out then i will give you thirty sheets and thirty 
change of garments but if ye cannot declare it me then shall 
ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments and they said 
unto him put forth thy riddle that we may hear it 
and he said unto them out of the eater came forth meat and out 
of the strong came forth sweetness and they could not in three days 
expound the riddle 
and it came to pass on the seventh day that they said unto 
samson s wife entice thy husband that he may declare unto us the 
riddle lest we burn thee and thy father s house with fire have ye 
called us to take that we have is it not so and samson s wife 
wept before him and said thou dost but hate me and lovest me not 
thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people and hast 
not told it me and he said unto her behold i have not told it my 
father nor my mother and shall i tell it thee and she wept 
before him the seven days while their feast lasted and it came to 
pass on the seventh day that he told her because she lay sore upon 
him and she told the riddle to the children of her people 
and the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before 
the sun went down what is sweeter than honey and what is stronger 
than a lion and he said unto them if ye had not plowed with my 
heifer ye had not found out my riddle 
and the spirit of the lord came upon him and he went down to 
ashkelon and slew thirty men of them and took their spoil and gave 
change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle and his anger 
was kindled and he went up to his father s house 
but samson s wife was given to his companion whom he had used 
as his friend 
but it came to pass within a while after in the time of wheat 
harvest that samson visited his wife with a kid and he said i will 
go in to my wife into the chamber but her father would not suffer him 
to go in 
and her father said i verily thought that thou hadst utterly 
hated her therefore i gave her to thy companion is not her younger 
sister fairer than she take her i pray thee instead of her 
and samson said concerning them now shall i be more blameless 
than the philistines though i do them a displeasure 
and samson went and caught three hundred foxes and took 
firebrands and turned tail to tail and put a firebrand in the midst 
between two tails 
and when he had set the brands on fire he let them go into the 
standing corn of the philistines and burnt up both the shocks and 
also the standing corn with the vineyards and olives 
then the philistines said who hath done this and they answered 
samson the son in law of the timnite because he had taken his wife 
and given her to his companion and the philistines came up and burnt 
her and her father with fire 
and samson said unto them though ye have done this yet will i 
be avenged of you and after that i will cease 
and he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter and he 
went down and dwelt in the top of the rock etam 
then the philistines went up and pitched in judah and spread 
themselves in lehi 
and the men of judah said why are ye come up against us and 
they answered to bind samson are we come up to do to him as he hath 
done to us 
then three thousand men of judah went to the top of the rock 
etam and said to samson knowest thou not that the philistines are 
rulers over us what is this that thou hast done unto us and he said 
unto them as they did unto me so have i done unto them 
and they said unto him we are come down to bind thee that we 
may deliver thee into the hand of the philistines and samson said 
unto them swear unto me that ye will not fall upon me yourselves 
and they spake unto him saying no but we will bind thee fast 
and deliver thee into their hand but surely we will not kill thee 
and they bound him with two new cords and brought him up from the 
rock 
and when he came unto lehi the philistines shouted against him 
and the spirit of the lord came mightily upon him and the cords that 
were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire and his 
bands loosed from off his hands 
and he found a new jawbone of an ass and put forth his hand 
and took it and slew a thousand men therewith 
and samson said with the jawbone of an ass heaps upon heaps 
with the jaw of an ass have i slain a thousand men 
and it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking that 
he cast away the jawbone out of his hand and called that place 
ramathlehi 
and he was sore athirst and called on the lord and said thou 
hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant and 
now shall i die for thirst and fall into the hand of the 
uncircumcised but god clave an hollow place that was in the 
jaw and there came water thereout and when he had drunk his spirit 
came again and he revived wherefore he called the name thereof 
enhakkore which is in lehi unto this day 
and he judged israel in the days of the philistines twenty 
years 
then went samson to gaza and saw there an harlot and went in 
unto her 
and it was told the gazites saying samson is come hither and 
they compassed him in and laid wait for him all night in the gate of 
the city and were quiet all the night saying in the morning when 
it is day we shall kill him 
and samson lay till midnight and arose at midnight and took the 
doors of the gate of the city and the two posts and went away with 
them bar and all and put them upon his shoulders and carried them 
up to the top of an hill that is before hebron 
and it came to pass afterward that he loved a woman in the 
valley of sorek whose name was delilah 
and the lords of the philistines came up unto her and said unto 
her entice him and see wherein his great strength lieth and by what 
means we may prevail against him that we may bind him to afflict him 
and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver 
and delilah said to samson tell me i pray thee wherein thy 
great strength lieth and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict 
thee 
and samson said unto her if they bind me with seven green withs 
that were never dried then shall i be weak and be as another man 
then the lords of the philistines brought up to her seven green 
withs which had not been dried and she bound him with them 
now there were men lying in wait abiding with her in the 
chamber 
and she said unto him the philistines be upon thee samson and he 
brake the withs as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the 
fire so his strength was not known 
and delilah said unto samson behold thou hast mocked me and 
told me lies now tell me i pray thee wherewith thou mightest be 
bound 
and he said unto her if they bind me fast with new ropes that 
never were occupied then shall i be weak and be as another man 
delilah therefore took new ropes and bound him therewith and 
said unto him the philistines be upon thee samson and there were 
liers in wait abiding in the chamber and he brake them from off his 
arms like a thread 
and delilah said unto samson hitherto thou hast mocked me and 
told me lies tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound and he said 
unto her if thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web 
and she fastened it with the pin and said unto him the 
philistines be upon thee samson and he awaked out of his sleep and 
went away with the pin of the beam and with the web 
and she said unto him how canst thou say i love thee when 
thine heart is not with me thou hast mocked me these three times and 
hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth 
and it came to pass when she pressed him daily with her words 
and urged him so that his soul was vexed unto death that he 
told her all his heart and said unto her there hath not come a razor 
upon mine head for i have been a nazarite unto god from my mother s 
womb if i be shaven then my strength will go from me and i shall 
become weak and be like any other man 
and when delilah saw that he had told her all his heart she 
sent and called for the lords of the philistines saying come up this 
once for he hath shewed me all his heart then the lords of the 
philistines came up unto her and brought money in their hand 
and she made him sleep upon her knees and she called for a man 
and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head and she 
began to afflict him and his strength went from him 
and she said the philistines be upon thee samson and he awoke 
out of his sleep and said i will go out as at other times before 
and shake myself and he wist not that the lord was departed from him 
but the philistines took him and put out his eyes and brought 
him down to gaza and bound him with fetters of brass and he did 
grind in the prison house 
howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was 
shaven 
then the lords of the philistines gathered them together for to 
offer a great sacrifice unto dagon their god and to rejoice for they 
said our god hath delivered samson our enemy into our hand 
and when the people saw him they praised their god for they 
said our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy and the 
destroyer of our country which slew many of us 
and it came to pass when their hearts were merry that they 
said call for samson that he may make us sport and they called for 
samson out of the prison house and he made them sport and they set 
him between the pillars 
and samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand suffer 
me that i may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth that i 
may lean upon them 
now the house was full of men and women and all the lords of 
the philistines were there and there were upon the roof about three 
thousand men and women that beheld while samson made sport 
and samson called unto the lord and said o lord god remember 
me i pray thee and strengthen me i pray thee only this once o 
god that i may be at once avenged of the philistines for my two eyes 
and samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the 
house stood and on which it was borne up of the one with his right 
hand and of the other with his left 
and samson said let me die with the philistines and he bowed 
himself with all his might and the house fell upon the lords and 
upon all the people that were therein so the dead which he slew at 
his death were more than they which he slew in his life 
then his brethren and all the house of his father came down and 
took him and brought him up and buried him between zorah and eshtaol 
in the buryingplace of manoah his father and he judged israel twenty 
years 
and there was a man of mount ephraim whose name was micah 
and he said unto his mother the eleven hundred shekels of silver 
that were taken from thee about which thou cursedst and spakest of 
also in mine ears behold the silver is with me i took it and his 
mother said blessed be thou of the lord my son 
and when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to 
his mother his mother said i had wholly dedicated the silver unto 
the lord from my hand for my son to make a graven image and a molten 
image now therefore i will restore it unto thee 
yet he restored the money unto his mother and his mother took 
two hundred shekels of silver and gave them to the founder who made 
thereof a graven image and a molten image and they were in the house 
of micah 
and the man micah had an house of gods and made an ephod and 
teraphim and consecrated one of his sons who became his priest 
in those days there was no king in israel but every man did that 
which was right in his own eyes 
and there was a young man out of bethlehemjudah of the family of 
judah who was a levite and he sojourned there 
and the man departed out of the city from bethlehemjudah to 
sojourn where he could find a place and he came to mount ephraim to 
the house of micah as he journeyed 
and micah said unto him whence comest thou and he said unto 
him i am a levite of bethlehemjudah and i go to sojourn where i may 
find a place 
and micah said unto him dwell with me and be unto me a father 
and a priest and i will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year 
and a suit of apparel and thy victuals so the levite went in 
and the levite was content to dwell with the man and the young 
man was unto him as one of his sons 
and micah consecrated the levite and the young man became his 
priest and was in the house of micah 
then said micah now know i that the lord will do me good 
seeing i have a levite to my priest 
in those days there was no king in israel and in those days the 
tribe of the danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in for unto 
that day all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the 
tribes of israel 
and the children of dan sent of their family five men from their 
coasts men of valour from zorah and from eshtaol to spy out the 
land and to search it and they said unto them go search the land 
who when they came to mount ephraim to the house of micah they 
lodged there 
when they were by the house of micah they knew the voice of the 
young man the levite and they turned in thither and said unto him 
who brought thee hither and what makest thou in this place and what 
hast thou here and he said unto them thus and thus dealeth 
micah with me and hath hired me and i am his priest 
and they said unto him ask counsel we pray thee of god that 
we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous 
and the priest said unto them go in peace before the lord is 
your way wherein ye go 
then the five men departed and came to laish and saw the people 
that were therein how they dwelt careless after the manner of the 
zidonians quiet and secure and there was no magistrate in the land 
that might put them to shame in any thing and they were far from the 
zidonians and had no business with any man 
and they came unto their brethren to zorah and eshtaol and their 
brethren said unto them what say ye and they said arise that 
we may go up against them for we have seen the land and behold it 
is very good and are ye still be not slothful to go and to enter to 
possess the land 
when ye go ye shall come unto a people secure and to a large 
land for god hath given it into your hands a place where there is no 
want of any thing that is in the earth 
and there went from thence of the family of the danites out of 
zorah and out of eshtaol six hundred men appointed with weapons of 
war 
and they went up and pitched in kirjathjearim in judah 
wherefore they called that place mahanehdan unto this day behold it 
is behind kirjathjearim 
and they passed thence unto mount ephraim and came unto the 
house of micah 
then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of 
laish and said unto their brethren do ye know that there is in these 
houses an ephod and teraphim and a graven image and a molten image 
now therefore consider what ye have to do 
and they turned thitherward and came to the house of the young 
man the levite even unto the house of micah and saluted him 
and the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war 
which were of the children of dan stood by the entering of the gate 
and the five men that went to spy out the land went up and came 
in thither and took the graven image and the ephod and the 
teraphim and the molten image and the priest stood in the entering 
of the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons 
of war 
and these went into micah s house and fetched the carved image 
the ephod and the teraphim and the molten image then said the 
priest unto them what do ye and they said unto him hold thy 
peace lay thine hand upon thy mouth and go with us and be to us a 
father and a priest is it better for thee to be a priest unto the 
house of one man or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family 
in israel and the priest s heart was glad and he took the 
ephod and the teraphim and the graven image and went in the midst 
of the people 
so they turned and departed and put the little ones and the 
cattle and the carriage before them 
and when they were a good way from the house of micah the men 
that were in the houses near to micah s house were gathered together 
and overtook the children of dan 
and they cried unto the children of dan and they turned their 
faces and said unto micah what aileth thee that thou comest with 
such a company and he said ye have taken away my gods which i 
made and the priest and ye are gone away and what have i more and 
what is this that ye say unto me what aileth thee and the 
children of dan said unto him let not thy voice be heard among us 
lest angry fellows run upon thee and thou lose thy life with the 
lives of thy household 
and the children of dan went their way and when micah saw that 
they were too strong for him he turned and went back unto his house 
and they took the things which micah had made and the priest 
which he had and came unto laish unto a people that were at quiet 
and secure and they smote them with the edge of the sword and burnt 
the city with fire 
and there was no deliverer because it was far from zidon and 
they had no business with any man and it was in the valley that lieth 
by bethrehob and they built a city and dwelt therein 
and they called the name of the city dan after the name of dan 
their father who was born unto israel howbeit the name of the city 
was laish at the first 
and the children of dan set up the graven image and jonathan 
the son of gershom the son of manasseh he and his sons were priests 
to the tribe of dan until the day of the captivity of the land 
and they set them up micah s graven image which he made all 
the time that the house of god was in shiloh 
and it came to pass in those days when there was no king in 
israel that there was a certain levite sojourning on the side of 
mount ephraim who took to him a concubine out of bethlehemjudah 
and his concubine played the whore against him and went away 
from him unto her father s house to bethlehemjudah and was there four 
whole months 
and her husband arose and went after her to speak friendly unto 
her and to bring her again having his servant with him and a couple 
of asses and she brought him into her father s house and when the 
father of the damsel saw him he rejoiced to meet him 
and his father in law the damsel s father retained him and he 
abode with him three days so they did eat and drink and lodged 
there 
and it came to pass on the fourth day when they arose early in 
the morning that he rose up to depart and the damsel s father said 
unto his son in law comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread and 
afterward go your way 
and they sat down and did eat and drink both of them together 
for the damsel s father had said unto the man be content i pray 
thee and tarry all night and let thine heart be merry 
and when the man rose up to depart his father in law urged him 
therefore he lodged there again 
and he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart and 
the damsel s father said comfort thine heart i pray thee and they 
tarried until afternoon and they did eat both of them 
and when the man rose up to depart he and his concubine and 
his servant his father in law the damsel s father said unto him 
behold now the day draweth toward evening i pray you tarry all 
night behold the day groweth to an end lodge here that thine heart 
may be merry and to morrow get you early on your way that thou 
mayest go home 
but the man would not tarry that night but he rose up and 
departed and came over against jebus which is jerusalem and there 
were with him two asses saddled his concubine also was with him 
and when they were by jebus the day was far spent and the 
servant said unto his master come i pray thee and let us turn in 
into this city of the jebusites and lodge in it 
and his master said unto him we will not turn aside hither into 
the city of a stranger that is not of the children of israel we will 
pass over to gibeah 
and he said unto his servant come and let us draw near to one 
of these places to lodge all night in gibeah or in ramah 
and they passed on and went their way and the sun went down 
upon them when they were by gibeah which belongeth to benjamin 
and they turned aside thither to go in and to lodge in gibeah 
and when he went in he sat him down in a street of the city for 
there was no man that took them into his house to lodging 
and behold there came an old man from his work out of the 
field at even which was also of mount ephraim and he sojourned in 
gibeah but the men of the place were benjamites 
and when he had lifted up his eyes he saw a wayfaring man in 
the street of the city and the old man said whither goest thou and 
whence comest thou and he said unto him we are passing from 
bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount ephraim from thence am i and 
i went to bethlehemjudah but i am now going to the house of the lord 
and there is no man that receiveth me to house 
yet there is both straw and provender for our asses and there 
is bread and wine also for me and for thy handmaid and for the young 
man which is with thy servants there is no want of any thing 
and the old man said peace be with thee howsoever let all thy 
wants lie upon me only lodge not in the street 
so he brought him into his house and gave provender unto the 
asses and they washed their feet and did eat and drink 
now as they were making their hearts merry behold the men of 
the city certain sons of belial beset the house round about and 
beat at the door and spake to the master of the house the old man 
saying bring forth the man that came into thine house that we may 
know him 
and the man the master of the house went out unto them and 
said unto them nay my brethren nay i pray you do not so wickedly 
seeing that this man is come into mine house do not this folly 
behold here is my daughter a maiden and his concubine them i 
will bring out now and humble ye them and do with them what seemeth 
good unto you but unto this man do not so vile a thing 
but the men would not hearken to him so the man took his 
concubine and brought her forth unto them and they knew her and 
abused her all the night until the morning and when the day began to 
spring they let her go 
then came the woman in the dawning of the day and fell down at 
the door of the man s house where her lord was till it was light 
and her lord rose up in the morning and opened the doors of the 
house and went out to go his way and behold the woman his 
concubine was fallen down at the door of the house and her hands were 
upon the threshold 
and he said unto her up and let us be going but none 
answered 
then the man took her up upon an ass and the man rose up and gat him 
unto his place 
and when he was come into his house he took a knife and laid 
hold on his concubine and divided her together with her bones into 
twelve pieces and sent her into all the coasts of israel 
and it was so that all that saw it said there was no such deed 
done nor seen from the day that the children of israel came up out of 
the land of egypt unto this day consider of it take advice and 
speak your minds 
then all the children of israel went out and the congregation 
was gathered together as one man from dan even to beersheba with the 
land of gilead unto the lord in mizpeh 
and the chief of all the people even of all the tribes of 
israel presented themselves in the assembly of the people of god 
four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword 
now the children of benjamin heard that the children of israel 
were gone up to mizpeh then said the children of israel tell us 
how was this wickedness and the levite the husband of the 
woman that was slain answered and said i came into gibeah that 
belongeth to benjamin i and my concubine to lodge 
and the men of gibeah rose against me and beset the house round 
about upon me by night and thought to have slain me and my concubine 
have they forced that she is dead 
and i took my concubine and cut her in pieces and sent her 
throughout all the country of the inheritance of israel for they have 
committed lewdness and folly in israel 
behold ye are all children of israel give here your advice and 
counsel 
and all the people arose as one man saying we will not any of 
us go to his tent neither will we any of us turn into his house 
but now this shall be the thing which we will do to gibeah we 
will go up by lot against it and we will take ten men of an 
hundred throughout all the tribes of israel and an hundred of a 
thousand and a thousand out of ten thousand to fetch victual for the 
people that they may do when they come to gibeah of benjamin 
according to all the folly that they have wrought in israel 
so all the men of israel were gathered against the city knit 
together as one man 
and the tribes of israel sent men through all the tribe of 
benjamin saying what wickedness is this that is done among you 
now therefore deliver us the men the children of belial which 
are in gibeah that we may put them to death and put away evil from 
israel but the children of benjamin would not hearken to the voice of 
their brethren the children of israel 
but the children of benjamin gathered themselves together out of 
the cities unto gibeah to go out to battle against the children of 
israel 
and the children of benjamin were numbered at that time out of 
the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword beside the 
inhabitants of gibeah which were numbered seven hundred chosen men 
among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men 
lefthanded every one could sling stones at an hair breadth and not 
miss 
and the men of israel beside benjamin were numbered four 
hundred thousand men that drew sword all these were men of war 
and the children of israel arose and went up to the house of 
god and asked counsel of god and said which of us shall go up first 
to the battle against the children of benjamin and the lord said 
judah shall go up first 
and the children of israel rose up in the morning and encamped 
against gibeah 
and the men of israel went out to battle against benjamin and 
the men of israel put themselves in array to fight against them at 
gibeah 
and the children of benjamin came forth out of gibeah and 
destroyed down to the ground of the israelites that day twenty and two 
thousand men 
and the people the men of israel encouraged themselves and set 
their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in 
array the first day 
and the children of israel went up and wept before the lord 
until even and asked counsel of the lord saying shall i go up again 
to battle against the children of benjamin my brother and the lord 
said go up against him and the children of israel came near 
against the children of benjamin the second day 
and benjamin went forth against them out of gibeah the second 
day and destroyed down to the ground of the children of israel again 
eighteen thousand men all these drew the sword 
then all the children of israel and all the people went up 
and came unto the house of god and wept and sat there before the 
lord and fasted that day until even and offered burnt offerings and 
peace offerings before the lord 
and the children of israel enquired of the lord for the ark of 
the covenant of god was there in those days and phinehas the 
son of eleazar the son of aaron stood before it in those days 
saying shall i yet again go out to battle against the children of 
benjamin my brother or shall i cease and the lord said go up for 
to morrow i will deliver them into thine hand 
and israel set liers in wait round about gibeah 
and the children of israel went up against the children of 
benjamin on the third day and put themselves in array against gibeah 
as at other times 
and the children of benjamin went out against the people and 
were drawn away from the city and they began to smite of the people 
and kill as at other times in the highways of which one goeth up to 
the house of god and the other to gibeah in the field about thirty 
men of israel 
and the children of benjamin said they are smitten down before 
us as at the first but the children of israel said let us flee and 
draw them from the city unto the highways 
and all the men of israel rose up out of their place and put 
themselves in array at baaltamar and the liers in wait of israel came 
forth out of their places even out of the meadows of gibeah 
and there came against gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all 
israel and the battle was sore but they knew not that evil was near 
them 
and the lord smote benjamin before israel and the children of 
israel destroyed of the benjamites that day twenty and five thousand 
and an hundred men all these drew the sword 
so the children of benjamin saw that they were smitten for the 
men of israel gave place to the benjamites because they trusted unto 
the liers in wait which they had set beside gibeah 
and the liers in wait hasted and rushed upon gibeah and the 
liers in wait drew themselves along and smote all the city with the 
edge of the sword 
now there was an appointed sign between the men of israel and 
the liers in wait that they should make a great flame with smoke rise 
up out of the city 
and when the men of israel retired in the battle benjamin began 
to smite and kill of the men of israel about thirty persons for they 
said surely they are smitten down before us as in the first battle 
but when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a 
pillar of smoke the benjamites looked behind them and behold the 
flame of the city ascended up to heaven 
and when the men of israel turned again the men of benjamin 
were amazed for they saw that evil was come upon them 
therefore they turned their backs before the men of israel unto 
the way of the wilderness but the battle overtook them and them 
which came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them 
thus they inclosed the benjamites round about and chased them 
and trode them down with ease over against gibeah toward the 
sunrising 
and there fell of benjamin eighteen thousand men all these were 
men of valour 
and they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of 
rimmon and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men 
and pursued hard after them unto gidom and slew two thousand men of 
them 
so that all which fell that day of benjamin were twenty and five 
thousand men that drew the sword all these were men of valour 
but six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the 
rock rimmon and abode in the rock rimmon four months 
and the men of israel turned again upon the children of 
benjamin and smote them with the edge of the sword as well the men 
of every city as the beast and all that came to hand also they set 
on fire all the cities that they came to 
now the men of israel had sworn in mizpeh saying there shall 
not any of us give his daughter unto benjamin to wife 
and the people came to the house of god and abode there till 
even before god and lifted up their voices and wept sore and 
said o lord god of israel why is this come to pass in israel that 
there should be to day one tribe lacking in israel and it came 
to pass on the morrow that the people rose early and built there an 
altar and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings 
and the children of israel said who is there among all the 
tribes of israel that came not up with the congregation unto the lord 
for they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the 
lord to mizpeh saying he shall surely be put to death 
and the children of israel repented them for benjamin their 
brother and said there is one tribe cut off from israel this day 
how shall we do for wives for them that remain seeing we have 
sworn by the lord that we will not give them of our daughters to 
wives and they said what one is there of the tribes of israel 
that came not up to mizpeh to the lord and behold there came none 
to the camp from jabeshgilead to the assembly 
for the people were numbered and behold there were none of the 
inhabitants of jabeshgilead there 
and the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the 
valiantest and commanded them saying go and smite the inhabitants 
of jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword with the women and the 
children 
and this is the thing that ye shall do ye shall utterly destroy 
every male and every woman that hath lain by man 
and they found among the inhabitants of jabeshgilead four 
hundred young virgins that had known no man by lying with any male 
and they brought them unto the camp to shiloh which is in the land of 
canaan 
and the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of 
benjamin that were in the rock rimmon and to call peaceably unto 
them 
and benjamin came again at that time and they gave them wives 
which they had saved alive of the women of jabeshgilead and yet so 
they sufficed them not 
and the people repented them for benjamin because that the lord 
had made a breach in the tribes of israel 
then the elders of the congregation said how shall we do for 
wives for them that remain seeing the women are destroyed out of 
benjamin and they said there must be an inheritance for them 
that be escaped of benjamin that a tribe be not destroyed out of 
israel 
howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters for the 
children of israel have sworn saying cursed be he that giveth a wife 
to benjamin 
then they said behold there is a feast of the lord in shiloh 
yearly in a place which is on the north side of bethel on the east 
side of the highway that goeth up from bethel to shechem and on the 
south of lebonah 
therefore they commanded the children of benjamin saying go 
and lie in wait in the vineyards and see and behold if the 
daughters of shiloh come out to dance in dances then come ye out of 
the vineyards and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of 
shiloh and go to the land of benjamin 
and it shall be when their fathers or their brethren come unto 
us to complain that we will say unto them be favourable unto them 
for our sakes because we reserved not to each man his wife in the 
war for ye did not give unto them at this time that ye should be 
guilty 
and the children of benjamin did so and took them wives 
according to their number of them that danced whom they caught and 
they went and returned unto their inheritance and repaired the 
cities and dwelt in them 
and the children of israel departed thence at that time every 
man to his tribe and to his family and they went out from thence 
every man to his inheritance 
in those days there was no king in israel every man did that 
which was right in his own eyes 
the book of ruth 
now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled that there 
was a famine in the land and a certain man of bethlehemjudah went to 
sojourn in the country of moab he and his wife and his two sons 
and the name of the man was elimelech and the name of his wife 
naomi and the name of his two sons mahlon and chilion ephrathites of 
bethlehemjudah and they came into the country of moab and continued 
there 
and elimelech naomi s husband died and she was left and her two 
sons 
and they took them wives of the women of moab the name of the one 
was orpah and the name of the other ruth and they dwelled there 
about ten years 
and mahlon and chilion died also both of them and the woman was 
left of her two sons and her husband 
then she arose with her daughters in law that she might return 
from the country of moab for she had heard in the country of moab how 
that the lord had visited his people in giving them bread 
wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was and her 
two daughters in law with her and they went on the way to return unto 
the land of judah 
and naomi said unto her two daughters in law go return each to 
her mother s house the lord deal kindly with you as ye have dealt 
with the dead and with me 
the lord grant you that ye may find rest each of you in the house 
of her husband then she kissed them and they lifted up their voice 
and wept 
and they said unto her surely we will return with thee unto thy 
people 
and naomi said turn again my daughters why will ye go with me 
are there yet any more sons in my womb that they may be your 
husbands turn again my daughters go your way for i am too 
old to have an husband if i should say i have hope if i should have 
an husband also to night and should also bear sons would ye 
tarry for them till they were grown would ye stay for them from 
having husbands nay my daughters for it grieveth me much for your 
sakes that the hand of the lord is gone out against me 
and they lifted up their voice and wept again and orpah kissed 
her mother in law but ruth clave unto her 
and she said behold thy sister in law is gone back unto her 
people and unto her gods return thou after thy sister in law 
and ruth said intreat me not to leave thee or to return from 
following after thee for whither thou goest i will go and where 
thou lodgest i will lodge thy people shall be my people and thy god 
my god where thou diest will i die and there will i be buried 
the lord do so to me and more also if ought but death part thee and 
me 
when she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her then 
she left speaking unto her 
so they two went until they came to bethlehem and it came to 
pass when they were come to bethlehem that all the city was moved 
about them and they said is this naomi and she said unto 
them call me not naomi call me mara for the almighty hath dealt 
very bitterly with me 
i went out full and the lord hath brought me home again empty 
why then call ye me naomi seeing the lord hath testified against me 
and the almighty hath afflicted me so naomi returned and ruth 
the moabitess her daughter in law with her which returned out of 
the country of moab and they came to bethlehem in the beginning of 
barley harvest 
and naomi had a kinsman of her husband s a mighty man of wealth 
of the family of elimelech and his name was boaz 
and ruth the moabitess said unto naomi let me now go to the 
field and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight i shall find 
grace 
and she said unto her go my daughter 
and she went and came and gleaned in the field after the 
reapers and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging 
unto boaz who was of the kindred of elimelech 
and behold boaz came from bethlehem and said unto the reapers 
the lord be with you and they answered him the lord bless thee 
then said boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers 
whose damsel is this and the servant that was set over the 
reapers answered and said it is the moabitish damsel that came back 
with naomi out of the country of moab and she said i pray you 
let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves so she 
came and hath continued even from the morning until now that she 
tarried a little in the house 
then said boaz unto ruth hearest thou not my daughter go not to 
glean in another field neither go from hence but abide here fast by 
my maidens let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap and 
go thou after them have i not charged the young men that they shall 
not touch thee and when thou art athirst go unto the vessels and 
drink of that which the young men have drawn 
then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground and 
said unto him why have i found grace in thine eyes that thou 
shouldest take knowledge of me seeing i am a stranger and boaz 
answered and said unto her it hath fully been shewed me all that 
thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine 
husband and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother and the 
land of thy nativity and art come unto a people which thou knewest 
not heretofore 
the lord recompense thy work and a full reward be given thee of 
the lord god of israel under whose wings thou art come to trust 
then she said let me find favour in thy sight my lord for that 
thou hast comforted me and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto 
thine handmaid though i be not like unto one of thine handmaidens 
and boaz said unto her at mealtime come thou hither and eat of 
the bread and dip thy morsel in the vinegar and she sat beside the 
reapers and he reached her parched corn and she did eat and was 
sufficed and left 
and when she was risen up to glean boaz commanded his young men 
saying let her glean even among the sheaves and reproach her not 
and let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her and 
leave them that she may glean them and rebuke her not 
so she gleaned in the field until even and beat out that she had 
gleaned and it was about an ephah of barley 
and she took it up and went into the city and her mother in law 
saw what she had gleaned and she brought forth and gave to her that 
she had reserved after she was sufficed 
and her mother in law said unto her where hast thou gleaned to 
day and where wroughtest thou blessed be he that did take knowledge 
of thee and she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought 
and said the man s name with whom i wrought to day is boaz 
and naomi said unto her daughter in law blessed be he of the 
lord who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the 
dead and naomi said unto her the man is near of kin unto us one of 
our next kinsmen 
and ruth the moabitess said he said unto me also thou shalt 
keep fast by my young men until they have ended all my harvest 
and naomi said unto ruth her daughter in law it is good my 
daughter that thou go out with his maidens that they meet thee not 
in any other field 
so she kept fast by the maidens of boaz to glean unto the end of 
barley harvest and of wheat harvest and dwelt with her mother in law 
then naomi her mother in law said unto her my daughter shall i 
not seek rest for thee that it may be well with thee and now is 
not boaz of our kindred with whose maidens thou wast behold he 
winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor 
wash thyself therefore and anoint thee and put thy raiment upon 
thee and get thee down to the floor but make not thyself known unto 
the man until he shall have done eating and drinking 
and it shall be when he lieth down that thou shalt mark the 
place where he shall lie and thou shalt go in and uncover his feet 
and lay thee down and he will tell thee what thou shalt do 
and she said unto her all that thou sayest unto me i will do 
and she went down unto the floor and did according to all that 
her mother in law bade her 
and when boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry he 
went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn and she came softly 
and uncovered his feet and laid her down 
and it came to pass at midnight that the man was afraid and 
turned himself and behold a woman lay at his feet 
and he said who art thou and she answered i am ruth thine 
handmaid spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid for thou art 
a near kinsman 
and he said blessed be thou of the lord my daughter for thou 
hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning 
inasmuch as thou followedst not young men whether poor or rich 
and now my daughter fear not i will do to thee all that thou 
requirest for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a 
virtuous woman 
and now it is true that i am thy near kinsman howbeit there is a 
kinsman nearer than i 
tarry this night and it shall be in the morning that if he will 
perform unto thee the part of a kinsman well let him do the 
kinsman s part but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee 
then will i do the part of a kinsman to thee as the lord liveth lie 
down until the morning 
and she lay at his feet until the morning and she rose up before 
one could know another and he said let it not be known that a woman 
came into the floor 
also he said bring the vail that thou hast upon thee and hold 
it 
and when she held it he measured six measures of barley and laid it 
on her and she went into the city 
and when she came to her mother in law she said who art thou 
my daughter and she told her all that the man had done to her 
and she said these six measures of barley gave he me for he 
said to me go not empty unto thy mother in law 
then said she sit still my daughter until thou know how the 
matter will fall for the man will not be in rest until he have 
finished the thing this day 
then went boaz up to the gate and sat him down there and 
behold the kinsman of whom boaz spake came by unto whom he said ho 
such a one turn aside sit down here and he turned aside and sat 
down 
and he took ten men of the elders of the city and said sit ye 
down here and they sat down 
and he said unto the kinsman naomi that is come again out of the 
country of moab selleth a parcel of land which was our brother 
elimelech s and i thought to advertise thee saying buy it 
before the inhabitants and before the elders of my people if thou 
wilt redeem it redeem it but if thou wilt not redeem it then tell 
me that i may know for there is none to redeem it beside thee and i 
am after thee and he said i will redeem it 
then said boaz what day thou buyest the field of the hand of 
naomi thou must buy it also of ruth the moabitess the wife of the 
dead to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance 
and the kinsman said i cannot redeem it for myself lest i mar 
mine own inheritance redeem thou my right to thyself for i cannot 
redeem it 
now this was the manner in former time in israel concerning 
redeeming and concerning changing for to confirm all things a man 
plucked off his shoe and gave it to his neighbour and this was a 
testimony in israel 
therefore the kinsman said unto boaz buy it for thee so he drew 
off his shoe 
and boaz said unto the elders and unto all the people ye are 
witnesses this day that i have bought all that was elimelech s and 
all that was chilion s and mahlon s of the hand of naomi 
moreover ruth the moabitess the wife of mahlon have i purchased 
to be my wife to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance 
that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren and 
from the gate of his place ye are witnesses this day 
and all the people that were in the gate and the elders said 
we are witnesses the lord make the woman that is come into thine 
house like rachel and like leah which two did build the house of 
israel and do thou worthily in ephratah and be famous in bethlehem 
and let thy house be like the house of pharez whom tamar bare 
unto judah of the seed which the lord shall give thee of this young 
woman 
so boaz took ruth and she was his wife and when he went in unto 
her the lord gave her conception and she bare a son 
and the women said unto naomi blessed be the lord which hath 
not left thee this day without a kinsman that his name may be famous 
in israel 
and he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life and a nourisher 
of thine old age for thy daughter in law which loveth thee which is 
better to thee than seven sons hath born him 
and naomi took the child and laid it in her bosom and became 
nurse unto it 
and the women her neighbours gave it a name saying there is a 
son born to naomi and they called his name obed he is the father of 
jesse the father of david 
now these are the generations of pharez pharez begat hezron 
and hezron begat ram and ram begat amminadab and amminadab 
begat nahshon and nahshon begat salmon and salmon begat boaz 
and boaz begat obed and obed begat jesse and jesse begat david 
the first book of samuel 
otherwise called 
the first book of the kings 
now there was a certain man of ramathaimzophim of mount ephraim 
and his name was elkanah the son of jeroham the son of elihu the 
son of tohu the son of zuph an ephrathite and he had two wives 
the name of the one was hannah and the name of the other peninnah 
and peninnah had children but hannah had no children 
and this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to 
sacrifice unto the lord of hosts in shiloh and the two sons of eli 
hophni and phinehas the priests of the lord were there 
and when the time was that elkanah offered he gave to peninnah 
his wife and to all her sons and her daughters portions but 
unto hannah he gave a worthy portion for he loved hannah but the 
lord had shut up her womb 
and her adversary also provoked her sore for to make her fret 
because the lord had shut up her womb 
and as he did so year by year when she went up to the house of 
the lord so she provoked her therefore she wept and did not eat 
then said elkanah her husband to her hannah why weepest thou 
and why eatest thou not and why is thy heart grieved am not i better 
to thee than ten sons so hannah rose up after they had eaten in 
shiloh and after they had drunk now eli the priest sat upon a seat 
by a post of the temple of the lord 
and she was in bitterness of soul and prayed unto the lord and 
wept sore 
and she vowed a vow and said o lord of hosts if thou wilt 
indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid and remember me and 
not forget thine handmaid but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man 
child then i will give him unto the lord all the days of his life 
and there shall no razor come upon his head 
and it came to pass as she continued praying before the lord 
that eli marked her mouth 
now hannah she spake in her heart only her lips moved but her 
voice was not heard therefore eli thought she had been drunken 
and eli said unto her how long wilt thou be drunken put away 
thy wine from thee 
and hannah answered and said no my lord i am a woman of a 
sorrowful spirit i have drunk neither wine nor strong drink but have 
poured out my soul before the lord 
count not thine handmaid for a daughter of belial for out of the 
abundance of my complaint and grief have i spoken hitherto 
then eli answered and said go in peace and the god of israel 
grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him 
and she said let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight so the 
woman went her way and did eat and her countenance was no more sad 
and they rose up in the morning early and worshipped before the 
lord and returned and came to their house to ramah and elkanah knew 
hannah his wife and the lord remembered her 
wherefore it came to pass when the time was come about after 
hannah had conceived that she bare a son and called his name samuel 
saying because i have asked him of the lord 
and the man elkanah and all his house went up to offer unto the 
lord the yearly sacrifice and his vow 
but hannah went not up for she said unto her husband i will not 
go up until the child be weaned and then i will bring him that he 
may appear before the lord and there abide for ever 
and elkanah her husband said unto her do what seemeth thee good 
tarry until thou have weaned him only the lord establish his word so 
the woman abode and gave her son suck until she weaned him 
and when she had weaned him she took him up with her with three 
bullocks and one ephah of flour and a bottle of wine and brought 
him unto the house of the lord in shiloh and the child was young 
and they slew a bullock and brought the child to eli 
and she said oh my lord as thy soul liveth my lord i am the 
woman that stood by thee here praying unto the lord 
for this child i prayed and the lord hath given me my petition 
which i asked of him therefore also i have lent him to the lord 
as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the lord and he worshipped 
the lord there 
and hannah prayed and said my heart rejoiceth in the lord mine 
horn is exalted in the lord my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies 
because i rejoice in thy salvation 
there is none holy as the lord for there is none beside thee 
neither is there any rock like our god 
talk no more so exceeding proudly let not arrogancy come out of 
your mouth for the lord is a god of knowledge and by him actions are 
weighed 
the bows of the mighty men are broken and they that stumbled are 
girded with strength 
they that were full have hired out themselves for bread and they 
that were hungry ceased so that the barren hath born seven and she 
that hath many children is waxed feeble 
the lord killeth and maketh alive he bringeth down to the grave 
and bringeth up 
the lord maketh poor and maketh rich he bringeth low and 
lifteth up 
he raiseth up the poor out of the dust and lifteth up the beggar 
from the dunghill to set them among princes and to make them inherit 
the throne of glory for the pillars of the earth are the lord s and 
he hath set the world upon them 
he will keep the feet of his saints and the wicked shall be 
silent in darkness for by strength shall no man prevail 
the adversaries of the lord shall be broken to pieces out of 
heaven shall he thunder upon them the lord shall judge the ends of 
the earth and he shall give strength unto his king and exalt the 
horn of his anointed 
and elkanah went to ramah to his house and the child did 
minister unto the lord before eli the priest 
now the sons of eli were sons of belial they knew not the lord 
and the priest s custom with the people was that when any man 
offered sacrifice the priest s servant came while the flesh was in 
seething with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand and he 
struck it into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot all that the 
fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself so they did in 
shiloh unto all the israelites that came thither 
also before they burnt the fat the priest s servant came and 
said to the man that sacrificed give flesh to roast for the priest 
for he will not have sodden flesh of thee but raw 
and if any man said unto him let them not fail to burn the fat 
presently and then take as much as thy soul desireth then he would 
answer him nay but thou shalt give it me now and if not i will 
take it by force 
wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the 
lord for men abhorred the offering of the lord 
but samuel ministered before the lord being a child girded with 
a linen ephod 
moreover his mother made him a little coat and brought it to him 
from year to year when she came up with her husband to offer the 
yearly sacrifice 
and eli blessed elkanah and his wife and said the lord give 
thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the lord and 
they went unto their own home 
and the lord visited hannah so that she conceived and bare 
three sons and two daughters and the child samuel grew before the 
lord 
now eli was very old and heard all that his sons did unto all 
israel and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of 
the tabernacle of the congregation 
and he said unto them why do ye such things for i hear of your 
evil dealings by all this people 
nay my sons for it is no good report that i hear ye make the 
lord s people to transgress 
if one man sin against another the judge shall judge him but if 
a man sin against the lord who shall intreat for him notwithstanding 
they hearkened not unto the voice of their father because the lord 
would slay them 
and the child samuel grew on and was in favour both with the 
lord and also with men 
and there came a man of god unto eli and said unto him thus 
saith the lord did i plainly appear unto the house of thy father 
when they were in egypt in pharaoh s house and did i choose him 
out of all the tribes of israel to be my priest to offer upon mine 
altar to burn incense to wear an ephod before me and did i give 
unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the 
children of israel wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at 
mine offering which i have commanded in my habitation and honourest 
thy sons above me to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the 
offerings of israel my people wherefore the lord god of israel 
saith i said indeed that thy house and the house of thy father 
should walk before me for ever but now the lord saith be it far from 
me for them that honour me i will honour and they that despise me 
shall be lightly esteemed 
behold the days come that i will cut off thine arm and the arm 
of thy father s house that there shall not be an old man in thine 
house 
and thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation in all the wealth 
which god shall give israel and there shall not be an old man in 
thine house for ever 
and the man of thine whom i shall not cut off from mine altar 
shall be to consume thine eyes and to grieve thine heart and all the 
increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age 
and this shall be a sign unto thee that shall come upon thy two 
sons on hophni and phinehas in one day they shall die both of them 
and i will raise me up a faithful priest that shall do according 
to that which is in mine heart and in my mind and i will build him a 
sure house and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever 
and it shall come to pass that every one that is left in thine 
house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel 
of bread and shall say put me i pray thee into one of the priests 
offices that i may eat a piece of bread 
and the child samuel ministered unto the lord before eli and the 
word of the lord was precious in those days there was no open vision 
and it came to pass at that time when eli was laid down in his 
place and his eyes began to wax dim that he could not see and 
ere the lamp of god went out in the temple of the lord where the ark 
of god was and samuel was laid down to sleep that the lord 
called samuel and he answered here am i 
and he ran unto eli and said here am i for thou calledst me 
and he said i called not lie down again and he went and lay down 
and the lord called yet again samuel and samuel arose and went 
to eli and said here am i for thou didst call me and he answered 
i called not my son lie down again 
now samuel did not yet know the lord neither was the word of the 
lord yet revealed unto him 
and the lord called samuel again the third time and he arose and 
went to eli and said here am i for thou didst call me and eli 
perceived that the lord had called the child 
therefore eli said unto samuel go lie down and it shall be if 
he call thee that thou shalt say speak lord for thy servant 
heareth so samuel went and lay down in his place 
and the lord came and stood and called as at other times 
samuel samuel then samuel answered speak for thy servant heareth 
and the lord said to samuel behold i will do a thing in israel 
at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle 
in that day i will perform against eli all things which i have 
spoken concerning his house when i begin i will also make an end 
for i have told him that i will judge his house for ever for the 
iniquity which he knoweth because his sons made themselves vile and 
he restrained them not 
and therefore i have sworn unto the house of eli that the 
iniquity of eli s house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor 
offering for ever 
and samuel lay until the morning and opened the doors of the 
house of the lord and samuel feared to shew eli the vision 
then eli called samuel and said samuel my son and he 
answered here am i 
and he said what is the thing that the lord hath said unto thee 
i pray thee hide it not from me god do so to thee and more also if 
thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee 
and samuel told him every whit and hid nothing from him and he 
said it is the lord let him do what seemeth him good 
and samuel grew and the lord was with him and did let none of 
his words fall to the ground 
and all israel from dan even to beersheba knew that samuel was 
established to be a prophet of the lord 
and the lord appeared again in shiloh for the lord revealed 
himself to samuel in shiloh by the word of the lord 
and the word of samuel came to all israel now israel went out 
against the philistines to battle and pitched beside ebenezer and 
the philistines pitched in aphek 
and the philistines put themselves in array against israel and 
when they joined battle israel was smitten before the philistines 
and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men 
and when the people were come into the camp the elders of israel 
said wherefore hath the lord smitten us to day before the 
philistines let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the lord out of 
shiloh unto us that when it cometh among us it may save us out of 
the hand of our enemies 
so the people sent to shiloh that they might bring from thence 
the ark of the covenant of the lord of hosts which dwelleth between 
the cherubims and the two sons of eli hophni and phinehas were 
there with the ark of the covenant of god 
and when the ark of the covenant of the lord came into the camp 
all israel shouted with a great shout so that the earth rang again 
and when the philistines heard the noise of the shout they said 
what meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the hebrews 
and they understood that the ark of the lord was come into the camp 
and the philistines were afraid for they said god is come into 
the camp and they said woe unto us for there hath not been such a 
thing heretofore 
woe unto us who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty 
gods these are the gods that smote the egyptians with all the plagues 
in the wilderness 
be strong and quit yourselves like men o ye philistines that ye 
be not servants unto the hebrews as they have been to you quit 
yourselves like men and fight 
and the philistines fought and israel was smitten and they fled 
every man into his tent and there was a very great slaughter for 
there fell of israel thirty thousand footmen 
and the ark of god was taken and the two sons of eli hophni and 
phinehas were slain 
and there ran a man of benjamin out of the army and came to 
shiloh the same day with his clothes rent and with earth upon his 
head 
and when he came lo eli sat upon a seat by the wayside 
watching for his heart trembled for the ark of god and when the man 
came into the city and told it all the city cried out 
and when eli heard the noise of the crying he said what meaneth 
the noise of this tumult and the man came in hastily and told eli 
now eli was ninety and eight years old and his eyes were dim 
that he could not see 
and the man said unto eli i am he that came out of the army and 
i fled to day out of the army and he said what is there done my 
son and the messenger answered and said israel is fled before 
the philistines and there hath been also a great slaughter among the 
people and thy two sons also hophni and phinehas are dead and the 
ark of god is taken 
and it came to pass when he made mention of the ark of god that 
he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate and his 
neck brake and he died for he was an old man and heavy and he had 
judged israel forty years 
and his daughter in law phinehas wife was with child near to 
be delivered and when she heard the tidings that the ark of god was 
taken and that her father in law and her husband were dead she bowed 
herself and travailed for her pains came upon her 
and about the time of her death the women that stood by her said 
unto her fear not for thou hast born a son but she answered not 
neither did she regard it 
and she named the child ichabod saying the glory is departed 
from israel because the ark of god was taken and because of her 
father in law and her husband 
and she said the glory is departed from israel for the ark of 
god is taken 
and the philistines took the ark of god and brought it from 
ebenezer unto ashdod 
when the philistines took the ark of god they brought it into the 
house of dagon and set it by dagon 
and when they of ashdod arose early on the morrow behold dagon 
was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the lord and 
they took dagon and set him in his place again 
and when they arose early on the morrow morning behold dagon was 
fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the lord and the 
head of dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the 
threshold only the stump of dagon was left to him 
therefore neither the priests of dagon nor any that come into 
dagon s house tread on the threshold of dagon in ashdod unto this 
day 
but the hand of the lord was heavy upon them of ashdod and he 
destroyed them and smote them with emerods even ashdod and the 
coasts thereof 
and when the men of ashdod saw that it was so they said the ark 
of the god of israel shall not abide with us for his hand is sore 
upon us and upon dagon our god 
they sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the philistines 
unto them and said what shall we do with the ark of the god of 
israel and they answered let the ark of the god of israel be carried 
about unto gath and they carried the ark of the god of israel about 
thither 
and it was so that after they had carried it about the hand of 
the lord was against the city with a very great destruction and he 
smote the men of the city both small and great and they had emerods 
in their secret parts 
therefore they sent the ark of god to ekron and it came to pass 
as the ark of god came to ekron that the ekronites cried out saying 
they have brought about the ark of the god of israel to us to slay us 
and our people 
so they sent and gathered together all the lords of the 
philistines and said send away the ark of the god of israel and let 
it go again to his own place that it slay us not and our people for 
there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city the hand of 
god was very heavy there 
and the men that died not were smitten with the emerods and the 
cry of the city went up to heaven 
and the ark of the lord was in the country of the philistines 
seven months 
and the philistines called for the priests and the diviners 
saying what shall we do to the ark of the lord tell us wherewith we 
shall send it to his place 
and they said if ye send away the ark of the god of israel send 
it not empty but in any wise return him a trespass offering then ye 
shall be healed and it shall be known to you why his hand is not 
removed from you 
then said they what shall be the trespass offering which we shall 
return to him they answered five golden emerods and five golden 
mice according to the number of the lords of the philistines for one 
plague was on you all and on your lords 
wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods and images of your 
mice that mar the land and ye shall give glory unto the god of 
israel peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you and from 
off your gods and from off your land 
wherefore then do ye harden your hearts as the egyptians and 
pharaoh hardened their hearts when he had wrought wonderfully among 
them did they not let the people go and they departed now 
therefore make a new cart and take two milch kine on which there 
hath come no yoke and tie the kine to the cart and bring their 
calves home from them and take the ark of the lord and lay it 
upon the cart and put the jewels of gold which ye return him for a 
trespass offering in a coffer by the side thereof and send it away 
that it may go 
and see if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to 
bethshemesh then he hath done us this great evil but if not then we 
shall know that it is not his hand that smote us it was a chance that 
happened to us 
and the men did so and took two milch kine and tied them to the 
cart and shut up their calves at home and they laid the ark of 
the lord upon the cart and the coffer with the mice of gold and the 
images of their emerods 
and the kine took the straight way to the way of bethshemesh and 
went along the highway lowing as they went and turned not aside to 
the right hand or to the left and the lords of the philistines went 
after them unto the border of bethshemesh 
and they of bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the 
valley and they lifted up their eyes and saw the ark and rejoiced 
to see it 
and the cart came into the field of joshua a bethshemite and 
stood there where there was a great stone and they clave the wood of 
the cart and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the lord 
and the levites took down the ark of the lord and the coffer 
that was with it wherein the jewels of gold were and put them on the 
great stone and the men of bethshemesh offered burnt offerings and 
sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the lord 
and when the five lords of the philistines had seen it they 
returned to ekron the same day 
and these are the golden emerods which the philistines returned 
for a trespass offering unto the lord for ashdod one for gaza one 
for askelon one for gath one for ekron one and the golden 
mice according to the number of all the cities of the philistines 
belonging to the five lords both of fenced cities and of country 
villages even unto the great stone of abel whereon they set down the 
ark of the lord which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of 
joshua the bethshemite 
and he smote the men of bethshemesh because they had looked into 
the ark of the lord even he smote of the people fifty thousand and 
threescore and ten men and the people lamented because the lord had 
smitten many of the people with a great slaughter 
and the men of bethshemesh said who is able to stand before this 
holy lord god and to whom shall he go up from us and they sent 
messengers to the inhabitants of kirjathjearim saying the 
philistines have brought again the ark of the lord come ye down and 
fetch it up to you 
and the men of kirjathjearim came and fetched up the ark of the 
lord and brought it into the house of abinadab in the hill and 
sanctified eleazar his son to keep the ark of the lord 
and it came to pass while the ark abode in kirjathjearim that 
the time was long for it was twenty years and all the house of 
israel lamented after the lord 
and samuel spake unto all the house of israel saying if ye do 
return unto the lord with all your hearts then put away the strange 
gods and ashtaroth from among you and prepare your hearts unto the 
lord and serve him only and he will deliver you out of the hand of 
the philistines 
then the children of israel did put away baalim and ashtaroth and 
served the lord only 
and samuel said gather all israel to mizpeh and i will pray for 
you unto the lord 
and they gathered together to mizpeh and drew water and poured 
it out before the lord and fasted on that day and said there we 
have sinned against the lord and samuel judged the children of israel 
in mizpeh 
and when the philistines heard that the children of israel were 
gathered together to mizpeh the lords of the philistines went up 
against israel and when the children of israel heard it they were 
afraid of the philistines 
and the children of israel said to samuel cease not to cry unto 
the lord our god for us that he will save us out of the hand of the 
philistines 
and samuel took a sucking lamb and offered it for a burnt 
offering wholly unto the lord and samuel cried unto the lord for 
israel and the lord heard him 
and as samuel was offering up the burnt offering the philistines 
drew near to battle against israel but the lord thundered with a 
great thunder on that day upon the philistines and discomfited them 
and they were smitten before israel 
and the men of israel went out of mizpeh and pursued the 
philistines and smote them until they came under bethcar 
then samuel took a stone and set it between mizpeh and shen and 
called the name of it ebenezer saying hitherto hath the lord helped 
us 
so the philistines were subdued and they came no more into the 
coast of israel and the hand of the lord was against the philistines 
all the days of samuel 
and the cities which the philistines had taken from israel were 
restored to israel from ekron even unto gath and the coasts thereof 
did israel deliver out of the hands of the philistines and there was 
peace between israel and the amorites 
and samuel judged israel all the days of his life 
and he went from year to year in circuit to bethel and gilgal 
and mizpeh and judged israel in all those places 
and his return was to ramah for there was his house and there 
he judged israel and there he built an altar unto the lord 
and it came to pass when samuel was old that he made his sons 
judges over israel 
now the name of his firstborn was joel and the name of his 
second abiah they were judges in beersheba 
and his sons walked not in his ways but turned aside after lucre 
and took bribes and perverted judgment 
then all the elders of israel gathered themselves together and 
came to samuel unto ramah and said unto him behold thou art 
old and thy sons walk not in thy ways now make us a king to judge us 
like all the nations 
but the thing displeased samuel when they said give us a king to 
judge us and samuel prayed unto the lord 
and the lord said unto samuel hearken unto the voice of the 
people in all that they say unto thee for they have not rejected 
thee but they have rejected me that i should not reign over them 
according to all the works which they have done since the day that 
i brought them up out of egypt even unto this day wherewith they have 
forsaken me and served other gods so do they also unto thee 
now therefore hearken unto their voice howbeit yet protest 
solemnly unto them and shew them the manner of the king that shall 
reign over them 
and samuel told all the words of the lord unto the people that 
asked of him a king 
and he said this will be the manner of the king that shall reign 
over you he will take your sons and appoint them for himself for 
his chariots and to be his horsemen and some shall run before his 
chariots 
and he will appoint him captains over thousands and captains 
over fifties and will set them to ear his ground and to reap his 
harvest and to make his instruments of war and instruments of his 
chariots 
and he will take your daughters to be confectionaries and to be 
cooks and to be bakers 
and he will take your fields and your vineyards and your 
oliveyards even the best of them and give them to his servants 
and he will take the tenth of your seed and of your vineyards 
and give to his officers and to his servants 
and he will take your menservants and your maidservants and 
your goodliest young men and your asses and put them to his work 
he will take the tenth of your sheep and ye shall be his 
servants 
and ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye 
shall have chosen you and the lord will not hear you in that day 
nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of samuel and 
they said nay but we will have a king over us that we also may 
be like all the nations and that our king may judge us and go out 
before us and fight our battles 
and samuel heard all the words of the people and he rehearsed 
them in the ears of the lord 
and the lord said to samuel hearken unto their voice and make 
them a king and samuel said unto the men of israel go ye every man 
unto his city 
now there was a man of benjamin whose name was kish the son of 
abiel the son of zeror the son of bechorath the son of aphiah a 
benjamite a mighty man of power 
and he had a son whose name was saul a choice young man and a 
goodly and there was not among the children of israel a goodlier 
person than he from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any 
of the people 
and the asses of kish saul s father were lost and kish said to 
saul his son take now one of the servants with thee and arise go 
seek the asses 
and he passed through mount ephraim and passed through the land 
of shalisha but they found them not then they passed through the 
land of shalim and there they were not and he passed through the 
land of the benjamites but they found them not 
and when they were come to the land of zuph saul said to his 
servant that was with him come and let us return lest my father 
leave caring for the asses and take thought for us 
and he said unto him behold now there is in this city a man of 
god and he is an honourable man all that he saith cometh surely to 
pass now let us go thither peradventure he can shew us our way that 
we should go 
then said saul to his servant but behold if we go what shall 
we bring the man for the bread is spent in our vessels and there is 
not a present to bring to the man of god what have we and the 
servant answered saul again and said behold i have here at hand the 
fourth part of a shekel of silver that will i give to the man of god 
to tell us our way 
beforetime in israel when a man went to enquire of god thus he 
spake come and let us go to the seer for he that is now called a 
prophet was beforetime called a seer then said saul to his 
servant well said come let us go so they went unto the city where 
the man of god was 
and as they went up the hill to the city they found young 
maidens going out to draw water and said unto them is the seer here 
and they answered them and said he is behold he is before 
you make haste now for he came to day to the city for there is a 
sacrifice of the people to day in the high place as soon as ye 
be come into the city ye shall straightway find him before he go up 
to the high place to eat for the people will not eat until he come 
because he doth bless the sacrifice and afterwards they eat that be 
bidden now therefore get you up for about this time ye shall find 
him 
and they went up into the city and when they were come into the 
city behold samuel came out against them for to go up to the high 
place 
now the lord had told samuel in his ear a day before saul came 
saying to morrow about this time i will send thee a man out of 
the land of benjamin and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my 
people israel that he may save my people out of the hand of the 
philistines for i have looked upon my people because their cry is 
come unto me 
and when samuel saw saul the lord said unto him behold the man 
whom i spake to thee of this same shall reign over my people 
then saul drew near to samuel in the gate and said tell me i 
pray thee where the seer s house is 
and samuel answered saul and said i am the seer go up before 
me unto the high place for ye shall eat with me to day and to morrow 
i will let thee go and will tell thee all that is in thine heart 
and as for thine asses that were lost three days ago set not thy 
mind on them for they are found and on whom is all the desire of 
israel is it not on thee and on all thy father s house and 
saul answered and said am not i a benjamite of the smallest of the 
tribes of israel and my family the least of all the families of the 
tribe of benjamin wherefore then speakest thou so to me and 
samuel took saul and his servant and brought them into the parlour 
and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden 
which were about thirty persons 
and samuel said unto the cook bring the portion which i gave 
thee of which i said unto thee set it by thee 
and the cook took up the shoulder and that which was upon it 
and set it before saul and samuel said behold that which is left 
set it before thee and eat for unto this time hath it been kept for 
thee since i said i have invited the people so saul did eat with 
samuel that day 
and when they were come down from the high place into the city 
samuel communed with saul upon the top of the house 
and they arose early and it came to pass about the spring of the 
day that samuel called saul to the top of the house saying up that 
i may send thee away and saul arose and they went out both of them 
he and samuel abroad 
and as they were going down to the end of the city samuel said 
to saul bid the servant pass on before us and he passed on but 
stand thou still a while that i may shew thee the word of god 
then samuel took a vial of oil and poured it upon his head and 
kissed him and said is it not because the lord hath anointed thee to 
be captain over his inheritance when thou art departed from me 
to day then thou shalt find two men by rachel s sepulchre in the 
border of benjamin at zelzah and they will say unto thee the asses 
which thou wentest to seek are found and lo thy father hath left 
the care of the asses and sorroweth for you saying what shall i do 
for my son then shalt thou go on forward from thence and thou 
shalt come to the plain of tabor and there shall meet thee three men 
going up to god to bethel one carrying three kids and another 
carrying three loaves of bread and another carrying a bottle of wine 
and they will salute thee and give thee two loaves of bread 
which thou shalt receive of their hands 
after that thou shalt come to the hill of god where is the 
garrison of the philistines and it shall come to pass when thou art 
come thither to the city that thou shalt meet a company of prophets 
coming down from the high place with a psaltery and a tabret and a 
pipe and a harp before them and they shall prophesy and the 
spirit of the lord will come upon thee and thou shalt prophesy with 
them and shalt be turned into another man 
and let it be when these signs are come unto thee that thou do 
as occasion serve thee for god is with thee 
and thou shalt go down before me to gilgal and behold i will 
come down unto thee to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice 
sacrifices of peace offerings seven days shalt thou tarry till i 
come to thee and shew thee what thou shalt do 
and it was so that when he had turned his back to go from 
samuel god gave him another heart and all those signs came to pass 
that day 
and when they came thither to the hill behold a company of 
prophets met him and the spirit of god came upon him and he 
prophesied among them 
and it came to pass when all that knew him beforetime saw that 
behold he prophesied among the prophets then the people said one to 
another what is this that is come unto the son of kish is saul also 
among the prophets and one of the same place answered and 
said but who is their father therefore it became a proverb is saul 
also among the prophets and when he had made an end of 
prophesying he came to the high place 
and saul s uncle said unto him and to his servant whither went 
ye and he said to seek the asses and when we saw that they were no 
where we came to samuel 
and saul s uncle said tell me i pray thee what samuel said 
unto you 
and saul said unto his uncle he told us plainly that the asses 
were found but of the matter of the kingdom whereof samuel spake he 
told him not 
and samuel called the people together unto the lord to mizpeh 
and said unto the children of israel thus saith the lord god of 
israel i brought up israel out of egypt and delivered you out of the 
hand of the egyptians and out of the hand of all kingdoms and of 
them that oppressed you and ye have this day rejected your god 
who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your 
tribulations and ye have said unto him nay but set a king over us 
now therefore present yourselves before the lord by your tribes and 
by your thousands 
and when samuel had caused all the tribes of israel to come 
near the tribe of benjamin was taken 
when he had caused the tribe of benjamin to come near by their 
families the family of matri was taken and saul the son of kish was 
taken and when they sought him he could not be found 
therefore they enquired of the lord further if the man should 
yet come thither and the lord answered behold he hath hid himself 
among the stuff 
and they ran and fetched him thence and when he stood among the 
people he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and 
upward 
and samuel said to all the people see ye him whom the lord hath 
chosen that there is none like him among all the people and all the 
people shouted and said god save the king 
then samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom and wrote 
it in a book and laid it up before the lord and samuel sent all the 
people away every man to his house 
and saul also went home to gibeah and there went with him a 
band of men whose hearts god had touched 
but the children of belial said how shall this man save us and 
they despised him and brought no presents but he held his peace 
then nahash the ammonite came up and encamped against 
jabeshgilead and all the men of jabesh said unto nahash make a 
covenant with us and we will serve thee 
and nahash the ammonite answered them on this condition will i 
make a covenant with you that i may thrust out all your right eyes 
and lay it for a reproach upon all israel 
and the elders of jabesh said unto him give us seven days 
respite that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of israel 
and then if there be no man to save us we will come out to thee 
then came the messengers to gibeah of saul and told the tidings 
in the ears of the people and all the people lifted up their voices 
and wept 
and behold saul came after the herd out of the field and saul 
said what aileth the people that they weep and they told him the 
tidings of the men of jabesh 
and the spirit of god came upon saul when he heard those tidings 
and his anger was kindled greatly 
and he took a yoke of oxen and hewed them in pieces and sent 
them throughout all the coasts of israel by the hands of messengers 
saying whosoever cometh not forth after saul and after samuel so 
shall it be done unto his oxen and the fear of the lord fell on the 
people and they came out with one consent 
and when he numbered them in bezek the children of israel were 
three hundred thousand and the men of judah thirty thousand 
and they said unto the messengers that came thus shall ye say 
unto the men of jabeshgilead to morrow by that time the sun be hot 
ye shall have help and the messengers came and shewed it to the men 
of jabesh and they were glad 
therefore the men of jabesh said to morrow we will come out 
unto you and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you 
and it was so on the morrow that saul put the people in three 
companies and they came into the midst of the host in the morning 
watch and slew the ammonites until the heat of the day and it came 
to pass that they which remained were scattered so that two of them 
were not left together 
and the people said unto samuel who is he that said shall saul 
reign over us bring the men that we may put them to death 
and saul said there shall not a man be put to death this day 
for to day the lord hath wrought salvation in israel 
then said samuel to the people come and let us go to gilgal 
and renew the kingdom there 
and all the people went to gilgal and there they made saul king 
before the lord in gilgal and there they sacrificed sacrifices of 
peace offerings before the lord and there saul and all the men of 
israel rejoiced greatly 
and samuel said unto all israel behold i have hearkened unto 
your voice in all that ye said unto me and have made a king over you 
and now behold the king walketh before you and i am old and 
grayheaded and behold my sons are with you and i have walked 
before you from my childhood unto this day 
behold here i am witness against me before the lord and before 
his anointed whose ox have i taken or whose ass have i taken or 
whom have i defrauded whom have i oppressed or of whose hand have i 
received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith and i will restore it 
you 
and they said thou hast not defrauded us nor oppressed us 
neither hast thou taken ought of any man s hand 
and he said unto them the lord is witness against you and his 
anointed is witness this day that ye have not found ought in my hand 
and they answered he is witness 
and samuel said unto the people it is the lord that advanced 
moses and aaron and that brought your fathers up out of the land of 
egypt 
now therefore stand still that i may reason with you before the 
lord of all the righteous acts of the lord which he did to you and to 
your fathers 
when jacob was come into egypt and your fathers cried unto the 
lord then the lord sent moses and aaron which brought forth your 
fathers out of egypt and made them dwell in this place 
and when they forgat the lord their god he sold them into the 
hand of sisera captain of the host of hazor and into the hand of the 
philistines and into the hand of the king of moab and they fought 
against them 
and they cried unto the lord and said we have sinned because 
we have forsaken the lord and have served baalim and ashtaroth but 
now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies and we will serve thee 
and the lord sent jerubbaal and bedan and jephthah and 
samuel and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every 
side and ye dwelled safe 
and when ye saw that nahash the king of the children of ammon 
came against you ye said unto me nay but a king shall reign over 
us when the lord your god was your king 
now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen and whom ye 
have desired and behold the lord hath set a king over you 
if ye will fear the lord and serve him and obey his voice and 
not rebel against the commandment of the lord then shall both ye and 
also the king that reigneth over you continue following the lord your 
god but if ye will not obey the voice of the lord but rebel 
against the commandment of the lord then shall the hand of the lord 
be against you as it was against your fathers 
now therefore stand and see this great thing which the lord 
will do before your eyes 
is it not wheat harvest to day i will call unto the lord and 
he shall send thunder and rain that ye may perceive and see that your 
wickedness is great which ye have done in the sight of the lord in 
asking you a king 
so samuel called unto the lord and the lord sent thunder and 
rain that day and all the people greatly feared the lord and samuel 
and all the people said unto samuel pray for thy servants unto 
the lord thy god that we die not for we have added unto all our sins 
this evil to ask us a king 
and samuel said unto the people fear not ye have done all this 
wickedness yet turn not aside from following the lord but serve the 
lord with all your heart and turn ye not aside for then should 
ye go after vain things which cannot profit nor deliver for they are 
vain 
for the lord will not forsake his people for his great name s 
sake because it hath pleased the lord to make you his people 
moreover as for me god forbid that i should sin against the 
lord in ceasing to pray for you but i will teach you the good and the 
right way only fear the lord and serve him in truth with all 
your heart for consider how great things he hath done for you 
but if ye shall still do wickedly ye shall be consumed both ye 
and your king 
saul reigned one year and when he had reigned two years over 
israel saul chose him three thousand men of israel whereof two 
thousand were with saul in michmash and in mount bethel and a 
thousand were with jonathan in gibeah of benjamin and the rest of the 
people he sent every man to his tent 
and jonathan smote the garrison of the philistines that was in 
geba and the philistines heard of it and saul blew the trumpet 
throughout all the land saying let the hebrews hear 
and all israel heard say that saul had smitten a garrison of the 
philistines and that israel also was had in abomination with the 
philistines and the people were called together after saul to gilgal 
and the philistines gathered themselves together to fight with 
israel thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen and 
people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude and they 
came up and pitched in michmash eastward from bethaven 
when the men of israel saw that they were in a strait for the 
people were distressed then the people did hide themselves in caves 
and in thickets and in rocks and in high places and in pits 
and some of the hebrews went over jordan to the land of gad and 
gilead as for saul he was yet in gilgal and all the people followed 
him trembling 
and he tarried seven days according to the set time that samuel 
had appointed but samuel came not to gilgal and the people were 
scattered from him 
and saul said bring hither a burnt offering to me and peace 
offerings and he offered the burnt offering 
and it came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of 
offering the burnt offering behold samuel came and saul went out to 
meet him that he might salute him 
and samuel said what hast thou done and saul said because i 
saw that the people were scattered from me and that thou camest not 
within the days appointed and that the philistines gathered 
themselves together at michmash therefore said i the 
philistines will come down now upon me to gilgal and i have not made 
supplication unto the lord i forced myself therefore and offered a 
burnt offering 
and samuel said to saul thou hast done foolishly thou hast not 
kept the commandment of the lord thy god which he commanded thee for 
now would the lord have established thy kingdom upon israel for ever 
but now thy kingdom shall not continue the lord hath sought him 
a man after his own heart and the lord hath commanded him to be 
captain over his people because thou hast not kept that which the 
lord commanded thee 
and samuel arose and gat him up from gilgal unto gibeah of 
benjamin and saul numbered the people that were present with him 
about six hundred men 
and saul and jonathan his son and the people that were present 
with them abode in gibeah of benjamin but the philistines encamped 
in michmash 
and the spoilers came out of the camp of the philistines in 
three companies one company turned unto the way that leadeth to 
ophrah unto the land of shual and another company turned the 
way to bethhoron and another company turned to the way of the border 
that looketh to the valley of zeboim toward the wilderness 
now there was no smith found throughout all the land of israel 
for the philistines said lest the hebrews make them swords or spears 
but all the israelites went down to the philistines to sharpen 
every man his share and his coulter and his axe and his mattock 
yet they had a file for the mattocks and for the coulters and 
for the forks and for the axes and to sharpen the goads 
so it came to pass in the day of battle that there was neither 
sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with 
saul and jonathan but with saul and with jonathan his son was there 
found 
and the garrison of the philistines went out to the passage of 
michmash 
now it came to pass upon a day that jonathan the son of saul 
said unto the young man that bare his armour come and let us go over 
to the philistines garrison that is on the other side but he told 
not his father 
and saul tarried in the uttermost part of gibeah under a 
pomegranate tree which is in migron and the people that were with him 
were about six hundred men and ahiah the son of ahitub 
ichabod s brother the son of phinehas the son of eli the lord s 
priest in shiloh wearing an ephod and the people knew not that 
jonathan was gone 
and between the passages by which jonathan sought to go over 
unto the philistines garrison there was a sharp rock on the one 
side and a sharp rock on the other side and the name of the one was 
bozez and the name of the other seneh 
the forefront of the one was situate northward over against 
michmash and the other southward over against gibeah 
and jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour come 
and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised it may be 
that the lord will work for us for there is no restraint to the lord 
to save by many or by few 
and his armourbearer said unto him do all that is in thine 
heart turn thee behold i am with thee according to thy heart 
then said jonathan behold we will pass over unto these men and 
we will discover ourselves unto them 
if they say thus unto us tarry until we come to you then we 
will stand still in our place and will not go up unto them 
but if they say thus come up unto us then we will go up for 
the lord hath delivered them into our hand and this shall be a sign 
unto us 
and both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the 
philistines and the philistines said behold the hebrews come forth 
out of the holes where they had hid themselves 
and the men of the garrison answered jonathan and his 
armourbearer and said come up to us and we will shew you a thing 
and jonathan said unto his armourbearer come up after me for the 
lord hath delivered them into the hand of israel 
and jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet and 
his armourbearer after him and they fell before jonathan and his 
armourbearer slew after him 
and that first slaughter which jonathan and his armourbearer 
made was about twenty men within as it were an half acre of land 
which a yoke of oxen might plow 
and there was trembling in the host in the field and among all 
the people the garrison and the spoilers they also trembled and 
the earth quaked so it was a very great trembling 
and the watchmen of saul in gibeah of benjamin looked and 
behold the multitude melted away and they went on beating down one 
another 
then said saul unto the people that were with him number now 
and see who is gone from us and when they had numbered behold 
jonathan and his armourbearer were not there 
and saul said unto ahiah bring hither the ark of god for the 
ark of god was at that time with the children of israel 
and it came to pass while saul talked unto the priest that the 
noise that was in the host of the philistines went on and increased 
and saul said unto the priest withdraw thine hand 
and saul and all the people that were with him assembled 
themselves and they came to the battle and behold every man s 
sword was against his fellow and there was a very great discomfiture 
moreover the hebrews that were with the philistines before that 
time which went up with them into the camp from the country round 
about even they also turned to be with the israelites that were with 
saul and jonathan 
likewise all the men of israel which had hid themselves in mount 
ephraim when they heard that the philistines fled even they also 
followed hard after them in the battle 
so the lord saved israel that day and the battle passed over 
unto bethaven 
and the men of israel were distressed that day for saul had 
adjured the people saying cursed be the man that eateth any food 
until evening that i may be avenged on mine enemies so none of the 
people tasted any food 
and all they of the land came to a wood and there was honey 
upon the ground 
and when the people were come into the wood behold the honey 
dropped but no man put his hand to his mouth for the people feared 
the oath 
but jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with 
the oath wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his 
hand and dipped it in an honeycomb and put his hand to his mouth 
and his eyes were enlightened 
then answered one of the people and said thy father straitly 
charged the people with an oath saying cursed be the man that eateth 
any food this day and the people were faint 
then said jonathan my father hath troubled the land see i 
pray you how mine eyes have been enlightened because i tasted a 
little of this honey 
how much more if haply the people had eaten freely to day of 
the spoil of their enemies which they found for had there not been 
now a much greater slaughter among the philistines and they 
smote the philistines that day from michmash to aijalon and the 
people were very faint 
and the people flew upon the spoil and took sheep and oxen 
and calves and slew them on the ground and the people did eat them 
with the blood 
then they told saul saying behold the people sin against the 
lord in that they eat with the blood and he said ye have 
transgressed roll a great stone unto me this day 
and saul said disperse yourselves among the people and say 
unto them bring me hither every man his ox and every man his sheep 
and slay them here and eat and sin not against the lord in eating 
with the blood 
and all the people brought every man his ox with him that night and 
slew them there 
and saul built an altar unto the lord the same was the first 
altar that he built unto the lord 
and saul said let us go down after the philistines by night 
and spoil them until the morning light and let us not leave a man of 
them and they said do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee then said 
the priest let us draw near hither unto god 
and saul asked counsel of god shall i go down after the 
philistines wilt thou deliver them into the hand of israel but he 
answered him not that day 
and saul said draw ye near hither all the chief of the people 
and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day 
for as the lord liveth which saveth israel though it be in 
jonathan my son he shall surely die but there was not a man among 
all the people that answered him 
then said he unto all israel be ye on one side and i and 
jonathan my son will be on the other side and the people said unto 
saul do what seemeth good unto thee 
therefore saul said unto the lord god of israel give a perfect 
lot 
and saul and jonathan were taken but the people escaped 
and saul said cast lots between me and jonathan my son and 
jonathan was taken 
then saul said to jonathan tell me what thou hast done and 
jonathan told him and said i did but taste a little honey with the 
end of the rod that was in mine hand and lo i must die 
and saul answered god do so and more also for thou shalt 
surely die jonathan 
and the people said unto saul shall jonathan die who hath 
wrought this great salvation in israel god forbid as the lord 
liveth there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground for 
he hath wrought with god this day so the people rescued jonathan 
that he died not 
then saul went up from following the philistines and the 
philistines went to their own place 
so saul took the kingdom over israel and fought against all his 
enemies on every side against moab and against the children of 
ammon and against edom and against the kings of zobah and against 
the philistines and whithersoever he turned himself he vexed them 
and he gathered an host and smote the amalekites and delivered 
israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them 
now the sons of saul were jonathan and ishui and melchishua 
and the names of his two daughters were these the name of the 
firstborn merab and the name of the younger michal and the 
name of saul s wife was ahinoam the daughter of ahimaaz and the name 
of the captain of his host was abner the son of ner saul s uncle 
and kish was the father of saul and ner the father of abner was 
the son of abiel 
and there was sore war against the philistines all the days of 
saul and when saul saw any strong man or any valiant man he took 
him unto him 
samuel also said unto saul the lord sent me to anoint thee to be 
king over his people over israel now therefore hearken thou unto the 
voice of the words of the lord 
thus saith the lord of hosts i remember that which amalek did to 
israel how he laid wait for him in the way when he came up from 
egypt 
now go and smite amalek and utterly destroy all that they have 
and spare them not but slay both man and woman infant and suckling 
ox and sheep camel and ass 
and saul gathered the people together and numbered them in 
telaim two hundred thousand footmen and ten thousand men of judah 
and saul came to a city of amalek and laid wait in the valley 
and saul said unto the kenites go depart get you down from 
among the amalekites lest i destroy you with them for ye shewed 
kindness to all the children of israel when they came up out of 
egypt so the kenites departed from among the amalekites 
and saul smote the amalekites from havilah until thou comest to 
shur that is over against egypt 
and he took agag the king of the amalekites alive and utterly 
destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword 
but saul and the people spared agag and the best of the sheep 
and of the oxen and of the fatlings and the lambs and all that was 
good and would not utterly destroy them but every thing that was 
vile and refuse that they destroyed utterly 
then came the word of the lord unto samuel saying it 
repenteth me that i have set up saul to be king for he is turned back 
from following me and hath not performed my commandments and it 
grieved samuel and he cried unto the lord all night 
and when samuel rose early to meet saul in the morning it was 
told samuel saying saul came to carmel and behold he set him up a 
place and is gone about and passed on and gone down to gilgal 
and samuel came to saul and saul said unto him blessed be thou 
of the lord i have performed the commandment of the lord 
and samuel said what meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in 
mine ears and the lowing of the oxen which i hear and saul 
said they have brought them from the amalekites for the people 
spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice unto the 
lord thy god and the rest we have utterly destroyed 
then samuel said unto saul stay and i will tell thee what the 
lord hath said to me this night and he said unto him say on 
and samuel said when thou wast little in thine own sight wast 
thou not made the head of the tribes of israel and the lord anointed 
thee king over israel and the lord sent thee on a journey and 
said go and utterly destroy the sinners the amalekites and fight 
against them until they be consumed 
wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the lord but 
didst fly upon the spoil and didst evil in the sight of the lord 
and saul said unto samuel yea i have obeyed the voice of the 
lord and have gone the way which the lord sent me and have brought 
agag the king of amalek and have utterly destroyed the amalekites 
but the people took of the spoil sheep and oxen the chief of 
the things which should have been utterly destroyed to sacrifice unto 
the lord thy god in gilgal 
and samuel said hath the lord as great delight in burnt 
offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the lord behold 
to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams 
for rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is 
as iniquity and idolatry because thou hast rejected the word of the 
lord he hath also rejected thee from being king 
and saul said unto samuel i have sinned for i have 
transgressed the commandment of the lord and thy words because i 
feared the people and obeyed their voice 
now therefore i pray thee pardon my sin and turn again with 
me that i may worship the lord 
and samuel said unto saul i will not return with thee for thou 
hast rejected the word of the lord and the lord hath rejected thee 
from being king over israel 
and as samuel turned about to go away he laid hold upon the 
skirt of his mantle and it rent 
and samuel said unto him the lord hath rent the kingdom of 
israel from thee this day and hath given it to a neighbour of thine 
that is better than thou 
and also the strength of israel will not lie nor repent for he 
is not a man that he should repent 
then he said i have sinned yet honour me now i pray thee 
before the elders of my people and before israel and turn again with 
me that i may worship the lord thy god 
so samuel turned again after saul and saul worshipped the lord 
then said samuel bring ye hither to me agag the king of the 
amalekites and agag came unto him delicately and agag said surely 
the bitterness of death is past 
and samuel said as the sword hath made women childless so 
shall thy mother be childless among women and samuel hewed agag in 
pieces before the lord in gilgal 
then samuel went to ramah and saul went up to his house to 
gibeah of saul 
and samuel came no more to see saul until the day of his death 
nevertheless samuel mourned for saul and the lord repented that he 
had made saul king over israel 
and the lord said unto samuel how long wilt thou mourn for saul 
seeing i have rejected him from reigning over israel fill thine horn 
with oil and go i will send thee to jesse the bethlehemite for i 
have provided me a king among his sons 
and samuel said how can i go if saul hear it he will kill me 
and the lord said take an heifer with thee and say i am come to 
sacrifice to the lord 
and call jesse to the sacrifice and i will shew thee what thou 
shalt do and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom i name unto thee 
and samuel did that which the lord spake and came to bethlehem 
and the elders of the town trembled at his coming and said comest 
thou peaceably and he said peaceably i am come to sacrifice 
unto the lord sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice 
and he sanctified jesse and his sons and called them to the 
sacrifice 
and it came to pass when they were come that he looked on 
eliab and said surely the lord s anointed is before him 
but the lord said unto samuel look not on his countenance or on 
the height of his stature because i have refused him for the lord 
seeth not as man seeth for man looketh on the outward appearance but 
the lord looketh on the heart 
then jesse called abinadab and made him pass before samuel and 
he said neither hath the lord chosen this 
then jesse made shammah to pass by and he said neither hath the 
lord chosen this 
again jesse made seven of his sons to pass before samuel and 
samuel said unto jesse the lord hath not chosen these 
and samuel said unto jesse are here all thy children and he 
said there remaineth yet the youngest and behold he keepeth the 
sheep and samuel said unto jesse send and fetch him for we will not 
sit down till he come hither 
and he sent and brought him in now he was ruddy and withal of 
a beautiful countenance and goodly to look to and the lord said 
arise anoint him for this is he 
then samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst 
of his brethren and the spirit of the lord came upon david from that 
day forward so samuel rose up and went to ramah 
but the spirit of the lord departed from saul and an evil 
spirit from the lord troubled him 
and saul s servants said unto him behold now an evil spirit 
from god troubleth thee 
let our lord now command thy servants which are before thee to 
seek out a man who is a cunning player on an harp and it shall come 
to pass when the evil spirit from god is upon thee that he shall 
play with his hand and thou shalt be well 
and saul said unto his servants provide me now a man that can 
play well and bring him to me 
then answered one of the servants and said behold i have seen 
a son of jesse the bethlehemite that is cunning in playing and a 
mighty valiant man and a man of war and prudent in matters and a 
comely person and the lord is with him 
wherefore saul sent messengers unto jesse and said send me 
david thy son which is with the sheep 
and jesse took an ass laden with bread and a bottle of wine 
and a kid and sent them by david his son unto saul 
and david came to saul and stood before him and he loved him 
greatly and he became his armourbearer 
and saul sent to jesse saying let david i pray thee stand 
before me for he hath found favour in my sight 
and it came to pass when the evil spirit from god was upon 
saul that david took an harp and played with his hand so saul was 
refreshed and was well and the evil spirit departed from him 
now the philistines gathered together their armies to battle and 
were gathered together at shochoh which belongeth to judah and 
pitched between shochoh and azekah in ephesdammim 
and saul and the men of israel were gathered together and 
pitched by the valley of elah and set the battle in array against the 
philistines 
and the philistines stood on a mountain on the one side and 
israel stood on a mountain on the other side and there was a valley 
between them 
and there went out a champion out of the camp of the philistines 
named goliath of gath whose height was six cubits and a span 
and he had an helmet of brass upon his head and he was armed 
with a coat of mail and the weight of the coat was five thousand 
shekels of brass 
and he had greaves of brass upon his legs and a target of brass 
between his shoulders 
and the staff of his spear was like a weaver s beam and his 
spear s head weighed six hundred shekels of iron and one bearing a 
shield went before him 
and he stood and cried unto the armies of israel and said unto 
them why are ye come out to set your battle in array am not i a 
philistine and ye servants to saul choose you a man for you and let 
him come down to me 
if he be able to fight with me and to kill me then will we be 
your servants but if i prevail against him and kill him then shall 
ye be our servants and serve us 
and the philistine said i defy the armies of israel this day 
give me a man that we may fight together 
when saul and all israel heard those words of the philistine 
they were dismayed and greatly afraid 
now david was the son of that ephrathite of bethlehemjudah 
whose name was jesse and he had eight sons and the man went among 
men for an old man in the days of saul 
and the three eldest sons of jesse went and followed saul to the 
battle and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were 
eliab the firstborn and next unto him abinadab and the third 
shammah 
and david was the youngest and the three eldest followed saul 
but david went and returned from saul to feed his father s sheep 
at bethlehem 
and the philistine drew near morning and evening and presented 
himself forty days 
and jesse said unto david his son take now for thy brethren an 
ephah of this parched corn and these ten loaves and run to the camp 
of thy brethren and carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of 
their thousand and look how thy brethren fare and take their pledge 
now saul and they and all the men of israel were in the 
valley of elah fighting with the philistines 
and david rose up early in the morning and left the sheep with 
a keeper and took and went as jesse had commanded him and he came 
to the trench as the host was going forth to the fight and shouted 
for the battle 
for israel and the philistines had put the battle in array army 
against army 
and david left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the 
carriage and ran into the army and came and saluted his brethren 
and as he talked with them behold there came up the champion 
the philistine of gath goliath by name out of the armies of the 
philistines and spake according to the same words and david heard 
them 
and all the men of israel when they saw the man fled from him 
and were sore afraid 
and the men of israel said have ye seen this man that is come 
up surely to defy israel is he come up and it shall be that the 
man who killeth him the king will enrich him with great riches and 
will give him his daughter and make his father s house free in 
israel 
and david spake to the men that stood by him saying what shall 
be done to the man that killeth this philistine and taketh away the 
reproach from israel for who is this uncircumcised philistine that 
he should defy the armies of the living god and the people 
answered him after this manner saying so shall it be done to the man 
that killeth him 
and eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men 
and eliab s anger was kindled against david and he said why camest 
thou down hither and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the 
wilderness i know thy pride and the naughtiness of thine heart for 
thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle 
and david said what have i now done is there not a because 
and he turned from him toward another and spake after the same 
manner and the people answered him again after the former manner 
and when the words were heard which david spake they rehearsed 
them before saul and he sent for him 
and david said to saul let no man s heart fail because of him 
thy servant will go and fight with this philistine 
and saul said to david thou art not able to go against this 
philistine to fight with him for thou art but a youth and he a man 
of war from his youth 
and david said unto saul thy servant kept his father s sheep 
and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock 
and i went out after him and smote him and delivered it out of 
his mouth and when he arose against me i caught him by his beard 
and smote him and slew him 
thy servant slew both the lion and the bear and this 
uncircumcised philistine shall be as one of them seeing he hath 
defied the armies of the living god 
david said moreover the lord that delivered me out of the paw 
of the lion and out of the paw of the bear he will deliver me out of 
the hand of this philistine and saul said unto david go and the 
lord be with thee 
and saul armed david with his armour and he put an helmet of 
brass upon his head also he armed him with a coat of mail 
and david girded his sword upon his armour and he assayed to 
go for he had not proved it and david said unto saul i cannot go 
with these for i have not proved them and david put them off him 
and he took his staff in his hand and chose him five smooth 
stones out of the brook and put them in a shepherd s bag which he 
had even in a scrip and his sling was in his hand and he drew near 
to the philistine 
and the philistine came on and drew near unto david and the man 
that bare the shield went before him 
and when the philistine looked about and saw david he 
disdained him for he was but a youth and ruddy and of a fair 
countenance 
and the philistine said unto david am i a dog that thou comest 
to me with staves and the philistine cursed david by his gods 
and the philistine said to david come to me and i will give 
thy flesh unto the fowls of the air and to the beasts of the field 
then said david to the philistine thou comest to me with a 
sword and with a spear and with a shield but i come to thee in the 
name of the lord of hosts the god of the armies of israel whom thou 
hast defied 
this day will the lord deliver thee into mine hand and i will 
smite thee and take thine head from thee and i will give the 
carcases of the host of the philistines this day unto the fowls of the 
air and to the wild beasts of the earth that all the earth may know 
that there is a god in israel 
and all this assembly shall know that the lord saveth not with 
sword and spear for the battle is the lord s and he will give you 
into our hands 
and it came to pass when the philistine arose and came and 
drew nigh to meet david that david hastened and ran toward the army 
to meet the philistine 
and david put his hand in his bag and took thence a stone and 
slang it and smote the philistine in his forehead that the stone 
sunk into his forehead and he fell upon his face to the earth 
so david prevailed over the philistine with a sling and with a 
stone and smote the philistine and slew him but there was no sword 
in the hand of david 
therefore david ran and stood upon the philistine and took his 
sword and drew it out of the sheath thereof and slew him and cut 
off his head therewith and when the philistines saw their champion 
was dead they fled 
and the men of israel and of judah arose and shouted and 
pursued the philistines until thou come to the valley and to the 
gates of ekron 
and the wounded of the philistines fell down by the way to shaaraim 
even unto gath and unto ekron 
and the children of israel returned from chasing after the 
philistines and they spoiled their tents 
and david took the head of the philistine and brought it to 
jerusalem but he put his armour in his tent 
and when saul saw david go forth against the philistine he said 
unto abner the captain of the host abner whose son is this youth 
and abner said as thy soul liveth o king i cannot tell 
and the king said enquire thou whose son the stripling is 
and as david returned from the slaughter of the philistine 
abner took him and brought him before saul with the head of the 
philistine in his hand 
and saul said to him whose son art thou thou young man and 
david answered i am the son of thy servant jesse the bethlehemite 
and it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking unto 
saul that the soul of jonathan was knit with the soul of david and 
jonathan loved him as his own soul 
and saul took him that day and would let him go no more home to 
his father s house 
then jonathan and david made a covenant because he loved him as 
his own soul 
and jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him and 
gave it to david and his garments even to his sword and to his bow 
and to his girdle 
and david went out whithersoever saul sent him and behaved 
himself wisely and saul set him over the men of war and he was 
accepted in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of 
saul s servants 
and it came to pass as they came when david was returned from 
the slaughter of the philistine that the women came out of all cities 
of israel singing and dancing to meet king saul with tabrets with 
joy and with instruments of musick 
and the women answered one another as they played and said saul 
hath slain his thousands and david his ten thousands 
and saul was very wroth and the saying displeased him and he 
said they have ascribed unto david ten thousands and to me they have 
ascribed but thousands and what can he have more but the kingdom 
and saul eyed david from that day and forward 
and it came to pass on the morrow that the evil spirit from god 
came upon saul and he prophesied in the midst of the house and david 
played with his hand as at other times and there was a javelin in 
saul s hand 
and saul cast the javelin for he said i will smite david even 
to the wall with it and david avoided out of his presence twice 
and saul was afraid of david because the lord was with him and 
was departed from saul 
therefore saul removed him from him and made him his captain 
over a thousand and he went out and came in before the people 
and david behaved himself wisely in all his ways and the lord 
was with him 
wherefore when saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely he 
was afraid of him 
but all israel and judah loved david because he went out and 
came in before them 
and saul said to david behold my elder daughter merab her will 
i give thee to wife only be thou valiant for me and fight the lord s 
battles 
for saul said let not mine hand be upon him but let the hand of the 
philistines be upon him 
and david said unto saul who am i and what is my life or my 
father s family in israel that i should be son in law to the king 
but it came to pass at the time when merab saul s daughter 
should have been given to david that she was given unto adriel the 
meholathite to wife 
and michal saul s daughter loved david and they told saul and 
the thing pleased him 
and saul said i will give him her that she may be a snare to 
him and that the hand of the philistines may be against him 
wherefore saul said to david thou shalt this day be my son in law in 
the one of the twain 
and saul commanded his servants saying commune with david 
secretly and say behold the king hath delight in thee and all his 
servants love thee now therefore be the king s son in law 
and saul s servants spake those words in the ears of david and 
david said seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king s son in law 
seeing that i am a poor man and lightly esteemed and the 
servants of saul told him saying on this manner spake david 
and saul said thus shall ye say to david the king desireth not 
any dowry but an hundred foreskins of the philistines to be avenged 
of the king s enemies but saul thought to make david fall by the hand 
of the philistines 
and when his servants told david these words it pleased david 
well to be the king s son in law and the days were not expired 
wherefore david arose and went he and his men and slew of the 
philistines two hundred men and david brought their foreskins and 
they gave them in full tale to the king that he might be the king s 
son in law and saul gave him michal his daughter to wife 
and saul saw and knew that the lord was with david and that 
michal saul s daughter loved him 
and saul was yet the more afraid of david and saul became 
david s enemy continually 
then the princes of the philistines went forth and it came to 
pass after they went forth that david behaved himself more wisely 
than all the servants of saul so that his name was much set by 
and saul spake to jonathan his son and to all his servants that 
they should kill david 
but jonathan saul s son delighted much in david and jonathan 
told david saying saul my father seeketh to kill thee now 
therefore i pray thee take heed to thyself until the morning and 
abide in a secret place and hide thyself and i will go out and 
stand beside my father in the field where thou art and i will commune 
with my father of thee and what i see that i will tell thee 
and jonathan spake good of david unto saul his father and said 
unto him let not the king sin against his servant against david 
because he hath not sinned against thee and because his works have 
been to thee ward very good for he did put his life in his hand 
and slew the philistine and the lord wrought a great salvation for 
all israel thou sawest it and didst rejoice wherefore then wilt 
thou sin against innocent blood to slay david without a because 
and saul hearkened unto the voice of jonathan and saul sware as the 
lord liveth he shall not be slain 
and jonathan called david and jonathan shewed him all those 
things 
and jonathan brought david to saul and he was in his presence as in 
times past 
and there was war again and david went out and fought with the 
philistines and slew them with a great slaughter and they fled from 
him 
and the evil spirit from the lord was upon saul as he sat in his 
house with his javelin in his hand and david played with his hand 
and saul sought to smite david even to the wall with the 
javelin but he slipped away out of saul s presence and he smote the 
javelin into the wall and david fled and escaped that night 
saul also sent messengers unto david s house to watch him and 
to slay him in the morning and michal david s wife told him saying 
if thou save not thy life to night to morrow thou shalt be slain 
so michal let david down through a window and he went and 
fled and escaped 
and michal took an image and laid it in the bed and put a 
pillow of goats hair for his bolster and covered it with a cloth 
and when saul sent messengers to take david she said he is 
sick 
and saul sent the messengers again to see david saying bring 
him up to me in the bed that i may slay him 
and when the messengers were come in behold there was an image 
in the bed with a pillow of goats hair for his bolster 
and saul said unto michal why hast thou deceived me so and 
sent away mine enemy that he is escaped and michal answered saul he 
said unto me let me go why should i kill thee so david fled 
and escaped and came to samuel to ramah and told him all that saul 
had done to him and he and samuel went and dwelt in naioth 
and it was told saul saying behold david is at naioth in 
ramah 
and saul sent messengers to take david and when they saw the 
company of the prophets prophesying and samuel standing as appointed 
over them the spirit of god was upon the messengers of saul and they 
also prophesied 
and when it was told saul he sent other messengers and they 
prophesied likewise and saul sent messengers again the third time 
and they prophesied also 
then went he also to ramah and came to a great well that is in 
sechu and he asked and said where are samuel and david and one 
said behold they be at naioth in ramah 
and he went thither to naioth in ramah and the spirit of god 
was upon him also and he went on and prophesied until he came to 
naioth in ramah 
and he stripped off his clothes also and prophesied before 
samuel in like manner and lay down naked all that day and all that 
night wherefore they say is saul also among the prophets and 
david fled from naioth in ramah and came and said before jonathan 
what have i done what is mine iniquity and what is my sin before thy 
father that he seeketh my life and he said unto him god 
forbid thou shalt not die behold my father will do nothing either 
great or small but that he will shew it me and why should my father 
hide this thing from me it is not so 
and david sware moreover and said thy father certainly knoweth 
that i have found grace in thine eyes and he saith let not jonathan 
know this lest he be grieved but truly as the lord liveth and as 
thy soul liveth there is but a step between me and death 
then said jonathan unto david whatsoever thy soul desireth i 
will even do it for thee 
and david said unto jonathan behold to morrow is the new moon 
and i should not fail to sit with the king at meat but let me go 
that i may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even 
if thy father at all miss me then say david earnestly asked 
leave of me that he might run to bethlehem his city for there is a 
yearly sacrifice there for all the family 
if he say thus it is well thy servant shall have peace but if 
he be very wroth then be sure that evil is determined by him 
therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant for thou hast 
brought thy servant into a covenant of the lord with thee 
notwithstanding if there be in me iniquity slay me thyself for why 
shouldest thou bring me to thy father and jonathan said far be 
it from thee for if i knew certainly that evil were determined by my 
father to come upon thee then would not i tell it thee then 
said david to jonathan who shall tell me or what if thy father 
answer thee roughly and jonathan said unto david come and 
let us go out into the field and they went out both of them into the 
field 
and jonathan said unto david o lord god of israel when i have 
sounded my father about to morrow any time or the third day and 
behold if there be good toward david and i then send not unto thee 
and shew it thee the lord do so and much more to jonathan but 
if it please my father to do thee evil then i will shew it thee and 
send thee away that thou mayest go in peace and the lord be with 
thee as he hath been with my father 
and thou shalt not only while yet i live shew me the kindness of 
the lord that i die not but also thou shalt not cut off thy 
kindness from my house for ever no not when the lord hath cut off 
the enemies of david every one from the face of the earth 
so jonathan made a covenant with the house of david saying let 
the lord even require it at the hand of david s enemies 
and jonathan caused david to swear again because he loved him 
for he loved him as he loved his own soul 
then jonathan said to david to morrow is the new moon and thou 
shalt be missed because thy seat will be empty 
and when thou hast stayed three days then thou shalt go down 
quickly and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the 
business was in hand and shalt remain by the stone ezel 
and i will shoot three arrows on the side thereof as though i 
shot at a mark 
and behold i will send a lad saying go find out the arrows 
if i expressly say unto the lad behold the arrows are on this side 
of thee take them then come thou for there is peace to thee and no 
hurt as the lord liveth 
but if i say thus unto the young man behold the arrows are 
beyond thee go thy way for the lord hath sent thee away 
and as touching the matter which thou and i have spoken of 
behold the lord be between thee and me for ever 
so david hid himself in the field and when the new moon was 
come the king sat him down to eat meat 
and the king sat upon his seat as at other times even upon a 
seat by the wall and jonathan arose and abner sat by saul s side 
and david s place was empty 
nevertheless saul spake not any thing that day for he thought 
something hath befallen him he is not clean surely he is not clean 
and it came to pass on the morrow which was the second day of 
the month that david s place was empty and saul said unto jonathan 
his son wherefore cometh not the son of jesse to meat neither 
yesterday nor to day and jonathan answered saul david 
earnestly asked leave of me to go to bethlehem and he said let 
me go i pray thee for our family hath a sacrifice in the city and 
my brother he hath commanded me to be there and now if i have found 
favour in thine eyes let me get away i pray thee and see my 
brethren therefore he cometh not unto the king s table 
then saul s anger was kindled against jonathan and he said unto 
him thou son of the perverse rebellious woman do not i know that 
thou hast chosen the son of jesse to thine own confusion and unto the 
confusion of thy mother s nakedness for as long as the son of 
jesse liveth upon the ground thou shalt not be established nor thy 
kingdom wherefore now send and fetch him unto me for he shall surely 
die 
and jonathan answered saul his father and said unto him 
wherefore shall he be slain what hath he done and saul cast a 
javelin at him to smite him whereby jonathan knew that it was 
determined of his father to slay david 
so jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger and did eat no 
meat the second day of the month for he was grieved for david 
because his father had done him shame 
and it came to pass in the morning that jonathan went out into 
the field at the time appointed with david and a little lad with him 
and he said unto his lad run find out now the arrows which i 
shoot and as the lad ran he shot an arrow beyond him 
and when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which 
jonathan had shot jonathan cried after the lad and said is not the 
arrow beyond thee and jonathan cried after the lad make 
speed haste stay not and jonathan s lad gathered up the arrows and 
came to his master 
but the lad knew not any thing only jonathan and david knew the 
matter 
and jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad and said unto him 
go carry them to the city 
and as soon as the lad was gone david arose out of a place 
toward the south and fell on his face to the ground and bowed 
himself three times and they kissed one another and wept one with 
another until david exceeded 
and jonathan said to david go in peace forasmuch as we have 
sworn both of us in the name of the lord saying the lord be between 
me and thee and between my seed and thy seed for ever and he arose 
and departed and jonathan went into the city 
then came david to nob to ahimelech the priest and ahimelech was 
afraid at the meeting of david and said unto him why art thou alone 
and no man with thee and david said unto ahimelech the priest 
the king hath commanded me a business and hath said unto me let no 
man know any thing of the business whereabout i send thee and what i 
have commanded thee and i have appointed my servants to such and such 
a place 
now therefore what is under thine hand give me five loaves of 
bread in mine hand or what there is present 
and the priest answered david and said there is no common bread 
under mine hand but there is hallowed bread if the young men have 
kept themselves at least from women 
and david answered the priest and said unto him of a truth 
women have been kept from us about these three days since i came out 
and the vessels of the young men are holy and the bread is in a 
manner common yea though it were sanctified this day in the vessel 
so the priest gave him hallowed bread for there was no bread 
there but the shewbread that was taken from before the lord to put 
hot bread in the day when it was taken away 
now a certain man of the servants of saul was there that day 
detained before the lord and his name was doeg an edomite the 
chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to saul 
and david said unto ahimelech and is there not here under thine 
hand spear or sword for i have neither brought my sword nor my 
weapons with me because the king s business required haste 
and the priest said the sword of goliath the philistine whom 
thou slewest in the valley of elah behold it is here wrapped in a 
cloth behind the ephod if thou wilt take that take it for there is 
no other save that here and david said there is none like that give 
it me 
and david arose and fled that day for fear of saul and went to 
achish the king of gath 
and the servants of achish said unto him is not this david the 
king of the land did they not sing one to another of him in dances 
saying saul hath slain his thousands and david his ten thousands 
and david laid up these words in his heart and was sore afraid 
of achish the king of gath 
and he changed his behaviour before them and feigned himself 
mad in their hands and scrabbled on the doors of the gate and let 
his spittle fall down upon his beard 
then said achish unto his servants lo ye see the man is mad 
wherefore then have ye brought him to me have i need of mad 
men that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my 
presence shall this fellow come into my house david therefore 
departed thence and escaped to the cave adullam and when his 
brethren and all his father s house heard it they went down thither 
to him 
and every one that was in distress and every one that was in 
debt and every one that was discontented gathered themselves unto 
him and he became a captain over them and there were with him about 
four hundred men 
and david went thence to mizpeh of moab and he said unto the 
king of moab let my father and my mother i pray thee come forth 
and be with you till i know what god will do for me 
and he brought them before the king of moab and they dwelt with 
him all the while that david was in the hold 
and the prophet gad said unto david abide not in the hold 
depart and get thee into the land of judah then david departed and 
came into the forest of hareth 
when saul heard that david was discovered and the men that were 
with him now saul abode in gibeah under a tree in ramah having his 
spear in his hand and all his servants were standing about him 
then saul said unto his servants that stood about him hear now ye 
benjamites will the son of jesse give every one of you fields and 
vineyards and make you all captains of thousands and captains of 
hundreds that all of you have conspired against me and there is 
none that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of 
jesse and there is none of you that is sorry for me or sheweth unto 
me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me to lie in wait 
as at this day then answered doeg the edomite which was set 
over the servants of saul and said i saw the son of jesse coming to 
nob to ahimelech the son of ahitub 
and he enquired of the lord for him and gave him victuals and 
gave him the sword of goliath the philistine 
then the king sent to call ahimelech the priest the son of 
ahitub and all his father s house the priests that were in nob and 
they came all of them to the king 
and saul said hear now thou son of ahitub and he answered 
here i am my lord 
and saul said unto him why have ye conspired against me thou 
and the son of jesse in that thou hast given him bread and a sword 
and hast enquired of god for him that he should rise against me to 
lie in wait as at this day then ahimelech answered the king 
and said and who is so faithful among all thy servants as david 
which is the king s son in law and goeth at thy bidding and is 
honourable in thine house did i then begin to enquire of god 
for him be it far from me let not the king impute any thing unto his 
servant nor to all the house of my father for thy servant knew 
nothing of all this less or more 
and the king said thou shalt surely die ahimelech thou and 
all thy father s house 
and the king said unto the footmen that stood about him turn 
and slay the priests of the lord because their hand also is with 
david and because they knew when he fled and did not shew it to me 
but the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall 
upon the priests of the lord 
and the king said to doeg turn thou and fall upon the priests 
and doeg the edomite turned and he fell upon the priests and slew on 
that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod 
and nob the city of the priests smote he with the edge of the 
sword both men and women children and sucklings and oxen and 
asses and sheep with the edge of the sword 
and one of the sons of ahimelech the son of ahitub named 
abiathar escaped and fled after david 
and abiathar shewed david that saul had slain the lord s 
priests 
and david said unto abiathar i knew it that day when doeg the 
edomite was there that he would surely tell saul i have occasioned 
the death of all the persons of thy father s house 
abide thou with me fear not for he that seeketh my life 
seeketh thy life but with me thou shalt be in safeguard 
then they told david saying behold the philistines fight 
against keilah and they rob the threshingfloors 
therefore david enquired of the lord saying shall i go and 
smite these philistines and the lord said unto david go and smite 
the philistines and save keilah 
and david s men said unto him behold we be afraid here in 
judah how much more then if we come to keilah against the armies of 
the philistines then david enquired of the lord yet again and 
the lord answered him and said arise go down to keilah for i will 
deliver the philistines into thine hand 
so david and his men went to keilah and fought with the 
philistines and brought away their cattle and smote them with a 
great slaughter so david saved the inhabitants of keilah 
and it came to pass when abiathar the son of ahimelech fled to 
david to keilah that he came down with an ephod in his hand 
and it was told saul that david was come to keilah and saul 
said god hath delivered him into mine hand for he is shut in by 
entering into a town that hath gates and bars 
and saul called all the people together to war to go down to 
keilah to besiege david and his men 
and david knew that saul secretly practised mischief against him 
and he said to abiathar the priest bring hither the ephod 
then said david o lord god of israel thy servant hath 
certainly heard that saul seeketh to come to keilah to destroy the 
city for my sake 
will the men of keilah deliver me up into his hand will saul 
come down as thy servant hath heard o lord god of israel i beseech 
thee tell thy servant and the lord said he will come down 
then said david will the men of keilah deliver me and my men 
into the hand of saul and the lord said they will deliver thee up 
then david and his men which were about six hundred arose and 
departed out of keilah and went whithersoever they could go and it 
was told saul that david was escaped from keilah and he forbare to go 
forth 
and david abode in the wilderness in strong holds and remained 
in a mountain in the wilderness of ziph and saul sought him every 
day but god delivered him not into his hand 
and david saw that saul was come out to seek his life and david 
was in the wilderness of ziph in a wood 
and jonathan saul s son arose and went to david into the wood 
and strengthened his hand in god 
and he said unto him fear not for the hand of saul my father 
shall not find thee and thou shalt be king over israel and i shall 
be next unto thee and that also saul my father knoweth 
and they two made a covenant before the lord and david abode in 
the wood and jonathan went to his house 
then came up the ziphites to saul to gibeah saying doth not 
david hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood in the hill of 
hachilah which is on the south of jeshimon now therefore o 
king come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down 
and our part shall be to deliver him into the king s hand 
and saul said blessed be ye of the lord for ye have compassion 
on me 
go i pray you prepare yet and know and see his place where 
his haunt is and who hath seen him there for it is told me that he 
dealeth very subtilly 
see therefore and take knowledge of all the lurking places 
where he hideth himself and come ye again to me with the certainty 
and i will go with you and it shall come to pass if he be in the 
land that i will search him out throughout all the thousands of 
judah 
and they arose and went to ziph before saul but david and his 
men were in the wilderness of maon in the plain on the south of 
jeshimon 
saul also and his men went to seek him and they told david 
wherefore he came down into a rock and abode in the wilderness of 
maon and when saul heard that he pursued after david in the 
wilderness of maon 
and saul went on this side of the mountain and david and his 
men on that side of the mountain and david made haste to get away for 
fear of saul for saul and his men compassed david and his men round 
about to take them 
but there came a messenger unto saul saying haste thee and 
come for the philistines have invaded the land 
wherefore saul returned from pursuing after david and went 
against the philistines therefore they called that place 
selahammahlekoth 
and david went up from thence and dwelt in strong holds at 
engedi 
and it came to pass when saul was returned from following the 
philistines that it was told him saying behold david is in the 
wilderness of engedi 
then saul took three thousand chosen men out of all israel and 
went to seek david and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats 
and he came to the sheepcotes by the way where was a cave and 
saul went in to cover his feet and david and his men remained in the 
sides of the cave 
and the men of david said unto him behold the day of which the 
lord said unto thee behold i will deliver thine enemy into thine 
hand that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee then 
david arose and cut off the skirt of saul s robe privily 
and it came to pass afterward that david s heart smote him 
because he had cut off saul s skirt 
and he said unto his men the lord forbid that i should do this 
thing unto my master the lord s anointed to stretch forth mine hand 
against him seeing he is the anointed of the lord 
so david stayed his servants with these words and suffered them 
not to rise against saul but saul rose up out of the cave and went 
on his way 
david also arose afterward and went out of the cave and cried 
after saul saying my lord the king and when saul looked behind him 
david stooped with his face to the earth and bowed himself 
and david said to saul wherefore hearest thou men s words 
saying behold david seeketh thy hurt behold this day thine 
eyes have seen how that the lord had delivered thee to day into mine 
hand in the cave and some bade me kill thee but mine eye spared 
thee and i said i will not put forth mine hand against my lord for 
he is the lord s anointed 
moreover my father see yea see the skirt of thy robe in my 
hand for in that i cut off the skirt of thy robe and killed thee 
not know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in 
mine hand and i have not sinned against thee yet thou huntest my 
soul to take it 
the lord judge between me and thee and the lord avenge me of 
thee but mine hand shall not be upon thee 
as saith the proverb of the ancients wickedness proceedeth from 
the wicked but mine hand shall not be upon thee 
after whom is the king of israel come out after whom dost thou 
pursue after a dead dog after a flea 
the lord therefore be judge and judge between me and thee and 
see and plead my because and deliver me out of thine hand 
and it came to pass when david had made an end of speaking 
these words unto saul that saul said is this thy voice my son 
david and saul lifted up his voice and wept 
and he said to david thou art more righteous than i for thou 
hast rewarded me good whereas i have rewarded thee evil 
and thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with 
me forasmuch as when the lord had delivered me into thine hand thou 
killedst me not 
for if a man find his enemy will he let him go well away 
wherefore the lord reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me 
this day 
and now behold i know well that thou shalt surely be king and 
that the kingdom of israel shall be established in thine hand 
swear now therefore unto me by the lord that thou wilt not cut 
off my seed after me and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my 
father s house 
and david sware unto saul and saul went home but david and his 
men gat them up unto the hold 
and samuel died and all the israelites were gathered together 
and lamented him and buried him in his house at ramah and david 
arose and went down to the wilderness of paran 
and there was a man in maon whose possessions were in carmel 
and the man was very great and he had three thousand sheep and a 
thousand goats and he was shearing his sheep in carmel 
now the name of the man was nabal and the name of his wife 
abigail and she was a woman of good understanding and of a beautiful 
countenance but the man was churlish and evil in his doings and he 
was of the house of caleb 
and david heard in the wilderness that nabal did shear his sheep 
and david sent out ten young men and david said unto the young 
men get you up to carmel and go to nabal and greet him in my name 
and thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity peace be 
both to thee and peace be to thine house and peace be unto all that 
thou hast 
and now i have heard that thou hast shearers now thy shepherds 
which were with us we hurt them not neither was there ought missing 
unto them all the while they were in carmel 
ask thy young men and they will shew thee wherefore let the 
young men find favour in thine eyes for we come in a good day give 
i pray thee whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants and to 
thy son david 
and when david s young men came they spake to nabal according to 
all those words in the name of david and ceased 
and nabal answered david s servants and said who is david and 
who is the son of jesse there be many servants now a days that break 
away every man from his master 
shall i then take my bread and my water and my flesh that i 
have killed for my shearers and give it unto men whom i know not 
whence they be so david s young men turned their way and went 
again and came and told him all those sayings 
and david said unto his men gird ye on every man his sword and 
they girded on every man his sword and david also girded on his 
sword and there went up after david about four hundred men and two 
hundred abode by the stuff 
but one of the young men told abigail nabal s wife saying 
behold david sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our 
master and he railed on them 
but the men were very good unto us and we were not hurt 
neither missed we any thing as long as we were conversant with them 
when we were in the fields they were a wall unto us both by 
night and day all the while we were with them keeping the sheep 
now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do for evil is 
determined against our master and against all his household for he 
is such a son of belial that a man cannot speak to him 
then abigail made haste and took two hundred loaves and two 
bottles of wine and five sheep ready dressed and five measures of 
parched corn and an hundred clusters of raisins and two hundred 
cakes of figs and laid them on asses 
and she said unto her servants go on before me behold i come 
after you but she told not her husband nabal 
and it was so as she rode on the ass that she came down by the 
covert on the hill and behold david and his men came down against 
her and she met them 
now david had said surely in vain have i kept all that this 
fellow hath in the wilderness so that nothing was missed of all that 
pertained unto him and he hath requited me evil for good 
so and more also do god unto the enemies of david if i leave of 
all that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against 
the wall 
and when abigail saw david she hasted and lighted off the ass 
and fell before david on her face and bowed herself to the ground 
and fell at his feet and said upon me my lord upon me let 
this iniquity be and let thine handmaid i pray thee speak in thine 
audience and hear the words of thine handmaid 
let not my lord i pray thee regard this man of belial even 
nabal for as his name is so is he nabal is his name and folly is 
with him but i thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord whom 
thou didst send 
now therefore my lord as the lord liveth and as thy soul 
liveth seeing the lord hath withholden thee from coming to she would 
blood and from avenging thyself with thine own hand now let thine 
enemies and they that seek evil to my lord be as nabal 
and now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my 
lord let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord 
i pray thee forgive the trespass of thine handmaid for the 
lord will certainly make my lord a sure house because my lord 
fighteth the battles of the lord and evil hath not been found in thee 
all thy days 
yet a man is risen to pursue thee and to seek thy soul but the 
soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the lord thy 
god and the souls of thine enemies them shall he sling out as out 
of the middle of a sling 
and it shall come to pass when the lord shall have done to my 
lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee 
and shall have appointed thee ruler over israel that this shall 
be no grief unto thee nor offence of heart unto my lord either that 
thou hast she would blood causeless or that my lord hath avenged himself 
but when the lord shall have dealt well with my lord then remember 
thine handmaid 
and david said to abigail blessed be the lord god of israel 
which sent thee this day to meet me and blessed be thy advice 
and blessed be thou which hast kept me this day from coming to she would 
blood and from avenging myself with mine own hand 
for in very deed as the lord god of israel liveth which hath 
kept me back from hurting thee except thou hadst hasted and come to 
meet me surely there had not been left unto nabal by the morning 
light any that pisseth against the wall 
so david received of her hand that which she had brought him 
and said unto her go up in peace to thine house see i have 
hearkened to thy voice and have accepted thy person 
and abigail came to nabal and behold he held a feast in his 
house like the feast of a king and nabal s heart was merry within 
him for he was very drunken wherefore she told him nothing less or 
more until the morning light 
but it came to pass in the morning when the wine was gone out 
of nabal and his wife had told him these things that his heart died 
within him and he became as a stone 
and it came to pass about ten days after that the lord smote 
nabal that he died 
and when david heard that nabal was dead he said blessed be 
the lord that hath pleaded the because of my reproach from the hand of 
nabal and hath kept his servant from evil for the lord hath returned 
the wickedness of nabal upon his own head and david sent and communed 
with abigail to take her to him to wife 
and when the servants of david were come to abigail to carmel 
they spake unto her saying david sent us unto thee to take thee to 
him to wife 
and she arose and bowed herself on her face to the earth and 
said behold let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the 
servants of my lord 
and abigail hasted and arose and rode upon an ass with five 
damsels of hers that went after her and she went after the messengers 
of david and became his wife 
david also took ahinoam of jezreel and they were also both of 
them his wives 
but saul had given michal his daughter david s wife to phalti 
the son of laish which was of gallim 
and the ziphites came unto saul to gibeah saying doth not david 
hide himself in the hill of hachilah which is before jeshimon 
then saul arose and went down to the wilderness of ziph having three 
thousand chosen men of israel with him to seek david in the 
wilderness of ziph 
and saul pitched in the hill of hachilah which is before 
jeshimon by the way but david abode in the wilderness and he saw 
that saul came after him into the wilderness 
david therefore sent out spies and understood that saul was come 
in very deed 
and david arose and came to the place where saul had pitched 
and david beheld the place where saul lay and abner the son of ner 
the captain of his host and saul lay in the trench and the people 
pitched round about him 
then answered david and said to ahimelech the hittite and to 
abishai the son of zeruiah brother to joab saying who will go down 
with me to saul to the camp and abishai said i will go down with 
thee 
so david and abishai came to the people by night and behold 
saul lay sleeping within the trench and his spear stuck in the ground 
at his bolster but abner and the people lay round about him 
then said abishai to david god hath delivered thine enemy into 
thine hand this day now therefore let me smite him i pray thee with 
the spear even to the earth at once and i will not smite him the 
second time 
and david said to abishai destroy him not for who can stretch 
forth his hand against the lord s anointed and be guiltless 
david said furthermore as the lord liveth the lord shall smite him 
or his day shall come to die or he shall descend into battle and 
perish 
the lord forbid that i should stretch forth mine hand against 
the lord s anointed but i pray thee take thou now the spear that is 
at his bolster and the cruse of water and let us go 
so david took the spear and the cruse of water from saul s 
bolster and they gat them away and no man saw it nor knew it 
neither awaked for they were all asleep because a deep sleep from 
the lord was fallen upon them 
then david went over to the other side and stood on the top of 
an hill afar off a great space being between them and david 
cried to the people and to abner the son of ner saying answerest 
thou not abner then abner answered and said who art thou that 
criest to the king and david said to abner art not thou a 
valiant man and who is like to thee in israel wherefore then hast 
thou not kept thy lord the king for there came one of the people in 
to destroy the king thy lord 
this thing is not good that thou hast done as the lord liveth 
ye are worthy to die because ye have not kept your master the lord s 
anointed 
and now see where the king s spear is and the cruse of water that was 
at his bolster 
and saul knew david s voice and said is this thy voice my son 
david and david said it is my voice my lord o king 
and he said wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his 
servant for what have i done or what evil is in mine hand 
now therefore i pray thee let my lord the king hear the words of his 
servant if the lord have stirred thee up against me let him accept 
an offering but if they be the children of men cursed be they before 
the lord for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the 
inheritance of the lord saying go serve other gods 
now therefore let not my blood fall to the earth before the 
face of the lord for the king of israel is come out to seek a flea 
as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains 
then said saul i have sinned return my son david for i will 
no more do thee harm because my soul was precious in thine eyes this 
day behold i have played the fool and have erred exceedingly 
and david answered and said behold the king s spear and let 
one of the young men come over and fetch it 
the lord render to every man his righteousness and his 
faithfulness for the lord delivered thee into my hand to day but i 
would not stretch forth mine hand against the lord s anointed 
and behold as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes 
so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the lord and let him 
deliver me out of all tribulation 
then saul said to david blessed be thou my son david thou 
shalt both do great things and also shalt still prevail so david 
went on his way and saul returned to his place 
and david said in his heart i shall now perish one day by the 
hand of saul there is nothing better for me than that i should 
speedily escape into the land of the philistines and saul shall 
despair of me to seek me any more in any coast of israel so shall i 
escape out of his hand 
and david arose and he passed over with the six hundred men that 
were with him unto achish the son of maoch king of gath 
and david dwelt with achish at gath he and his men every man 
with his household even david with his two wives ahinoam the 
jezreelitess and abigail the carmelitess nabal s wife 
and it was told saul that david was fled to gath and he sought 
no more again for him 
and david said unto achish if i have now found grace in thine 
eyes let them give me a place in some town in the country that i may 
dwell there for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with 
thee then achish gave him ziklag that day wherefore ziklag 
pertaineth unto the kings of judah unto this day 
and the time that david dwelt in the country of the philistines 
was a full year and four months 
and david and his men went up and invaded the geshurites and 
the gezrites and the amalekites for those nations were of old the 
inhabitants of the land as thou goest to shur even unto the land of 
egypt 
and david smote the land and left neither man nor woman alive 
and took away the sheep and the oxen and the asses and the camels 
and the apparel and returned and came to achish 
and achish said whither have ye made a road to day and david 
said against the south of judah and against the south of the 
jerahmeelites and against the south of the kenites 
and david saved neither man nor woman alive to bring tidings to 
gath saying lest they should tell on us saying so did david and 
so will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the 
philistines 
and achish believed david saying he hath made his people 
israel utterly to abhor him therefore he shall be my servant for 
ever 
and it came to pass in those days that the philistines gathered 
their armies together for warfare to fight with israel and achish 
said unto david know thou assuredly that thou shalt go out with me 
to battle thou and thy men 
and david said to achish surely thou shalt know what thy servant 
can do and achish said to david therefore will i make thee keeper of 
mine head for ever 
now samuel was dead and all israel had lamented him and buried 
him in ramah even in his own city and saul had put away those that 
had familiar spirits and the wizards out of the land 
and the philistines gathered themselves together and came and 
pitched in shunem and saul gathered all israel together and they 
pitched in gilboa 
and when saul saw the host of the philistines he was afraid and 
his heart greatly trembled 
and when saul enquired of the lord the lord answered him not 
neither by dreams nor by urim nor by prophets 
then said saul unto his servants seek me a woman that hath a 
familiar spirit that i may go to her and enquire of her and his 
servants said to him behold there is a woman that hath a familiar 
spirit at endor 
and saul disguised himself and put on other raiment and he 
went and two men with him and they came to the woman by night and 
he said i pray thee divine unto me by the familiar spirit and bring 
me him up whom i shall name unto thee 
and the woman said unto him behold thou knowest what saul hath 
done how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits and the 
wizards out of the land wherefore then layest thou a snare for my 
life to cause me to die and saul sware to her by the lord 
saying as the lord liveth there shall no punishment happen to thee 
for this thing 
then said the woman whom shall i bring up unto thee and he 
said bring me up samuel 
and when the woman saw samuel she cried with a loud voice and 
the woman spake to saul saying why hast thou deceived me for thou 
art saul 
and the king said unto her be not afraid for what sawest thou 
and the woman said unto saul i saw gods ascending out of the earth 
and he said unto her what form is he of and she said an old 
man cometh up and he is covered with a mantle and saul perceived 
that it was samuel and he stooped with his face to the ground and 
bowed himself 
and samuel said to saul why hast thou disquieted me to bring 
me up and saul answered i am sore distressed for the philistines 
make war against me and god is departed from me and answereth me no 
more neither by prophets nor by dreams therefore i have called 
thee that thou mayest make known unto me what i shall do 
then said samuel wherefore then dost thou ask of me seeing the 
lord is departed from thee and is become thine enemy and the 
lord hath done to him as he spake by me for the lord hath rent the 
kingdom out of thine hand and given it to thy neighbour even to 
david because thou obeyedst not the voice of the lord nor 
executedst his fierce wrath upon amalek therefore hath the lord done 
this thing unto thee this day 
moreover the lord will also deliver israel with thee into the 
hand of the philistines and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with 
me the lord also shall deliver the host of israel into the hand of 
the philistines 
then saul fell straightway all along on the earth and was sore 
afraid because of the words of samuel and there was no strength in 
him for he had eaten no bread all the day nor all the night 
and the woman came unto saul and saw that he was sore troubled 
and said unto him behold thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice and i 
have put my life in my hand and have hearkened unto thy words which 
thou spakest unto me 
now therefore i pray thee hearken thou also unto the voice of 
thine handmaid and let me set a morsel of bread before thee and eat 
that thou mayest have strength when thou goest on thy way 
but he refused and said i will not eat but his servants 
together with the woman compelled him and he hearkened unto their 
voice so he arose from the earth and sat upon the bed 
and the woman had a fat calf in the house and she hasted and 
killed it and took flour and kneaded it and did bake unleavened 
bread thereof and she brought it before saul and before his 
servants and they did eat then they rose up and went away that 
night 
now the philistines gathered together all their armies to aphek 
and the israelites pitched by a fountain which is in jezreel 
and the lords of the philistines passed on by hundreds and by 
thousands but david and his men passed on in the rereward with 
achish 
then said the princes of the philistines what do these hebrews 
here and achish said unto the princes of the philistines is not 
this david the servant of saul the king of israel which hath been 
with me these days or these years and i have found no fault in him 
since he fell unto me unto this day and the princes of the 
philistines were wroth with him and the princes of the philistines 
said unto him make this fellow return that he may go again to his 
place which thou hast appointed him and let him not go down with us 
to battle lest in the battle he be an adversary to us for wherewith 
should he reconcile himself unto his master should it not be with the 
heads of these men is not this david of whom they sang one to 
another in dances saying saul slew his thousands and david his ten 
thousands then achish called david and said unto him surely 
as the lord liveth thou hast been upright and thy going out and thy 
coming in with me in the host is good in my sight for i have not 
found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day 
nevertheless the lords favour thee not 
wherefore now return and go in peace that thou displease not 
the lords of the philistines 
and david said unto achish but what have i done and what hast 
thou found in thy servant so long as i have been with thee unto this 
day that i may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king 
and achish answered and said to david i know that thou art good 
in my sight as an angel of god notwithstanding the princes of the 
philistines have said he shall not go up with us to the battle 
wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master s 
servants that are come with thee and as soon as ye be up early in the 
morning and have light depart 
so david and his men rose up early to depart in the morning to 
return into the land of the philistines and the philistines went up 
to jezreel 
and it came to pass when david and his men were come to ziklag 
on the third day that the amalekites had invaded the south and 
ziklag and smitten ziklag and burned it with fire and had 
taken the women captives that were therein they slew not any either 
great or small but carried them away and went on their way 
so david and his men came to the city and behold it was burned 
with fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters were 
taken captives 
then david and the people that were with him lifted up their 
voice and wept until they had no more power to weep 
and david s two wives were taken captives ahinoam the 
jezreelitess and abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite 
and david was greatly distressed for the people spake of stoning 
him because the soul of all the people was grieved every man for his 
sons and for his daughters but david encouraged himself in the lord 
his god 
and david said to abiathar the priest ahimelech s son i pray 
thee bring me hither the ephod and abiathar brought thither the 
ephod to david 
and david enquired at the lord saying shall i pursue after this 
troop shall i overtake them and he answered him pursue for thou 
shalt surely overtake them and without fail recover all 
so david went he and the six hundred men that were with him and 
came to the brook besor where those that were left behind stayed 
but david pursued he and four hundred men for two hundred 
abode behind which were so faint that they could not go over the 
brook besor 
and they found an egyptian in the field and brought him to 
david and gave him bread and he did eat and they made him drink 
water and they gave him a piece of a cake of figs and two 
clusters of raisins and when he had eaten his spirit came again to 
him for he had eaten no bread nor drunk any water three days and 
three nights 
and david said unto him to whom belongest thou and whence art 
thou and he said i am a young man of egypt servant to an amalekite 
and my master left me because three days agone i fell sick 
we made an invasion upon the south of the cherethites and upon 
the coast which belongeth to judah and upon the south of caleb and 
we burned ziklag with fire 
and david said to him canst thou bring me down to this company 
and he said swear unto me by god that thou wilt neither kill me nor 
deliver me into the hands of my master and i will bring thee down to 
this company 
and when he had brought him down behold they were spread 
abroad upon all the earth eating and drinking and dancing because 
of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the 
philistines and out of the land of judah 
and david smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of 
the next day and there escaped not a man of them save four hundred 
young men which rode upon camels and fled 
and david recovered all that the amalekites had carried away 
and david rescued his two wives 
and there was nothing lacking to them neither small nor great 
neither sons nor daughters neither spoil nor any thing that they had 
taken to them david recovered all 
and david took all the flocks and the herds which they drave 
before those other cattle and said this is david s spoil 
and david came to the two hundred men which were so faint that 
they could not follow david whom they had made also to abide at the 
brook besor and they went forth to meet david and to meet the people 
that were with him and when david came near to the people he saluted 
them 
then answered all the wicked men and men of belial of those 
that went with david and said because they went not with us we will 
not give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered save to every 
man his wife and his children that they may lead them away and 
depart 
then said david ye shall not do so my brethren with that 
which the lord hath given us who hath preserved us and delivered the 
company that came against us into our hand 
for who will hearken unto you in this matter but as his part is 
that goeth down to the battle so shall his part be that tarrieth by 
the stuff they shall part alike 
and it was so from that day forward that he made it a statute 
and an ordinance for israel unto this day 
and when david came to ziklag he sent of the spoil unto the 
elders of judah even to his friends saying behold a present for you 
of the spoil of the enemies of the lord to them which were in 
bethel and to them which were in south ramoth and to them which were 
in jattir and to them which were in aroer and to them which 
were in siphmoth and to them which were in eshtemoa and to 
them which were in rachal and to them which were in the cities of the 
jerahmeelites and to them which were in the cities of the kenites 
and to them which were in hormah and to them which were in 
chorashan and to them which were in athach and to them which 
were in hebron and to all the places where david himself and his men 
were will not to haunt 
now the philistines fought against israel and the men of israel 
fled from before the philistines and fell down slain in mount gilboa 
and the philistines followed hard upon saul and upon his sons 
and the philistines slew jonathan and abinadab and melchishua 
saul s sons 
and the battle went sore against saul and the archers hit him 
and he was sore wounded of the archers 
then said saul unto his armourbearer draw thy sword and thrust 
me through therewith lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me 
through and abuse me but his armourbearer would not for he was sore 
afraid therefore saul took a sword and fell upon it 
and when his armourbearer saw that saul was dead he fell 
likewise upon his sword and died with him 
so saul died and his three sons and his armourbearer and all 
his men that same day together 
and when the men of israel that were on the other side of the 
valley and they that were on the other side jordan saw that the men 
of israel fled and that saul and his sons were dead they forsook the 
cities and fled and the philistines came and dwelt in them 
and it came to pass on the morrow when the philistines came to 
strip the slain that they found saul and his three sons fallen in 
mount gilboa 
and they cut off his head and stripped off his armour and sent 
into the land of the philistines round about to publish it in the 
house of their idols and among the people 
and they put his armour in the house of ashtaroth and they 
fastened his body to the wall of bethshan 
and when the inhabitants of jabeshgilead heard of that which the 
philistines had done to saul all the valiant men arose and 
went all night and took the body of saul and the bodies of his sons 
from the wall of bethshan and came to jabesh and burnt them there 
and they took their bones and buried them under a tree at 
jabesh and fasted seven days 
the second book of samuel 
otherwise called 
the second book of the kings 
now it came to pass after the death of saul when david was 
returned from the slaughter of the amalekites and david had abode two 
days in ziklag it came even to pass on the third day that 
behold a man came out of the camp from saul with his clothes rent 
and earth upon his head and so it was when he came to david that he 
fell to the earth and did obeisance 
and david said unto him from whence comest thou and he said unto 
him out of the camp of israel am i escaped 
and david said unto him how went the matter i pray thee tell 
me 
and he answered that the people are fled from the battle and many of 
the people also are fallen and dead and saul and jonathan his son are 
dead also 
and david said unto the young man that told him how knowest thou 
that saul and jonathan his son be dead and the young man that 
told him said as i happened by chance upon mount gilboa behold saul 
leaned upon his spear and lo the chariots and horsemen followed 
hard after him 
and when he looked behind him he saw me and called unto me and 
i answered here am i 
and he said unto me who art thou and i answered him i am an 
amalekite 
he said unto me again stand i pray thee upon me and slay me 
for anguish is come upon me because my life is yet whole in me 
so i stood upon him and slew him because i was sure that he 
could not live after that he was fallen and i took the crown that was 
upon his head and the bracelet that was on his arm and have brought 
them hither unto my lord 
then david took hold on his clothes and rent them and likewise 
all the men that were with him and they mourned and wept and 
fasted until even for saul and for jonathan his son and for the 
people of the lord and for the house of israel because they were 
fallen by the sword 
and david said unto the young man that told him whence art thou 
and he answered i am the son of a stranger an amalekite 
and david said unto him how wast thou not afraid to stretch 
forth thine hand to destroy the lord s anointed and david 
called one of the young men and said go near and fall upon him and 
he smote him that he died 
and david said unto him thy blood be upon thy head for thy 
mouth hath testified against thee saying i have slain the lord s 
anointed 
and david lamented with this lamentation over saul and over 
jonathan his son also he bade them teach the children of judah 
the use of the bow behold it is written in the book of jasher 
the beauty of israel is slain upon thy high places how are the 
mighty fallen tell it not in gath publish it not in the 
streets of askelon lest the daughters of the philistines rejoice 
lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph 
ye mountains of gilboa let there be no dew neither let there be 
rain upon you nor fields of offerings for there the shield of the 
mighty is vilely cast away the shield of saul as though he had not 
been anointed with oil 
from the blood of the slain from the fat of the mighty the bow 
of jonathan turned not back and the sword of saul returned not empty 
saul and jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives and in 
their death they were not divided they were swifter than eagles they 
were stronger than lions 
ye daughters of israel weep over saul who clothed you in 
scarlet with other delights who put on ornaments of gold upon your 
apparel 
how are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle o jonathan 
thou wast slain in thine high places 
i am distressed for thee my brother jonathan very pleasant hast 
thou been unto me thy love to me was wonderful passing the love of 
women 
how are the mighty fallen and the weapons of war perished 
and it came to pass after this that david enquired of the lord 
saying shall i go up into any of the cities of judah and the lord 
said unto him go up and david said whither shall i go up and he 
said unto hebron 
so david went up thither and his two wives also ahinoam the 
jezreelitess and abigail nabal s wife the carmelite 
and his men that were with him did david bring up every man with 
his household and they dwelt in the cities of hebron 
and the men of judah came and there they anointed david king over 
the house of judah and they told david saying that the men of 
jabeshgilead were they that buried saul 
and david sent messengers unto the men of jabeshgilead and said 
unto them blessed be ye of the lord that ye have shewed this 
kindness unto your lord even unto saul and have buried him 
and now the lord shew kindness and truth unto you and i also will 
requite you this kindness because ye have done this thing 
therefore now let your hands be strengthened and be ye valiant 
for your master saul is dead and also the house of judah have 
anointed me king over them 
but abner the son of ner captain of saul s host took ishbosheth 
the son of saul and brought him over to mahanaim and made him 
king over gilead and over the ashurites and over jezreel and over 
ephraim and over benjamin and over all israel 
ishbosheth saul s son was forty years old when he began to reign 
over israel and reigned two years but the house of judah followed 
david 
and the time that david was king in hebron over the house of 
judah was seven years and six months 
and abner the son of ner and the servants of ishbosheth the son 
of saul went out from mahanaim to gibeon 
and joab the son of zeruiah and the servants of david went out 
and met together by the pool of gibeon and they sat down the one on 
the one side of the pool and the other on the other side of the pool 
and abner said to joab let the young men now arise and play 
before us and joab said let them arise 
then there arose and went over by number twelve of benjamin 
which pertained to ishbosheth the son of saul and twelve of the 
servants of david 
and they caught every one his fellow by the head and thrust his 
sword in his fellow s side so they fell down together wherefore that 
place was called helkathhazzurim which is in gibeon 
and there was a very sore battle that day and abner was beaten 
and the men of israel before the servants of david 
and there were three sons of zeruiah there joab and abishai 
and asahel and asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe 
and asahel pursued after abner and in going he turned not to the 
right hand nor to the left from following abner 
then abner looked behind him and said art thou asahel and he 
answered i am 
and abner said to him turn thee aside to thy right hand or to 
thy left and lay thee hold on one of the young men and take thee his 
armour 
but asahel would not turn aside from following of him 
and abner said again to asahel turn thee aside from following 
me wherefore should i smite thee to the ground how then should i 
hold up my face to joab thy brother howbeit he refused to turn 
aside wherefore abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him 
under the fifth rib that the spear came out behind him and he fell 
down there and died in the same place and it came to pass that as 
many as came to the place where asahel fell down and died stood still 
joab also and abishai pursued after abner and the sun went down 
when they were come to the hill of ammah that lieth before giah by 
the way of the wilderness of gibeon 
and the children of benjamin gathered themselves together after 
abner and became one troop and stood on the top of an hill 
then abner called to joab and said shall the sword devour for 
ever knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end 
how long shall it be then ere thou bid the people return from 
following their brethren and joab said as god liveth unless 
thou hadst spoken surely then in the morning the people had gone up 
every one from following his brother 
so joab blew a trumpet and all the people stood still and 
pursued after israel no more neither fought they any more 
and abner and his men walked all that night through the plain 
and passed over jordan and went through all bithron and they came to 
mahanaim 
and joab returned from following abner and when he had gathered 
all the people together there lacked of david s servants nineteen men 
and asahel 
but the servants of david had smitten of benjamin and of abner s 
men so that three hundred and threescore men died 
and they took up asahel and buried him in the sepulchre of his 
father which was in bethlehem and joab and his men went all night 
and they came to hebron at break of day 
now there was long war between the house of saul and the house of 
david but david waxed stronger and stronger and the house of saul 
waxed weaker and weaker 
and unto david were sons born in hebron and his firstborn was 
amnon of ahinoam the jezreelitess and his second chileab of 
abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite and the third absalom the 
son of maacah the daughter of talmai king of geshur and the 
fourth adonijah the son of haggith and the fifth shephatiah the son 
of abital and the sixth ithream by eglah david s wife these 
were born to david in hebron 
and it came to pass while there was war between the house of saul 
and the house of david that abner made himself strong for the house 
of saul 
and saul had a concubine whose name was rizpah the daughter of 
aiah and ishbosheth said to abner wherefore hast thou gone in unto 
my father s concubine then was abner very wroth for the words of 
ishbosheth and said am i a dog s head which against judah do shew 
kindness this day unto the house of saul thy father to his brethren 
and to his friends and have not delivered thee into the hand of 
david that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this 
woman so do god to abner and more also except as the lord 
hath sworn to david even so i do to him to translate the 
kingdom from the house of saul and to set up the throne of david over 
israel and over judah from dan even to beersheba 
and he could not answer abner a word again because he feared 
him 
and abner sent messengers to david on his behalf saying whose 
is the land saying also make thy league with me and behold my 
hand shall be with thee to bring about all israel unto thee 
and he said well i will make a league with thee but one thing 
i require of thee that is thou shalt not see my face except thou 
first bring michal saul s daughter when thou comest to see my face 
and david sent messengers to ishbosheth saul s son saying 
deliver me my wife michal which i espoused to me for an hundred 
foreskins of the philistines 
and ishbosheth sent and took her from her husband even from 
phaltiel the son of laish 
and her husband went with her along weeping behind her to 
bahurim 
then said abner unto him go return and he returned 
and abner had communication with the elders of israel saying ye 
sought for david in times past to be king over you now then do 
it for the lord hath spoken of david saying by the hand of my 
servant david i will save my people israel out of the hand of the 
philistines and out of the hand of all their enemies 
and abner also spake in the ears of benjamin and abner went also 
to speak in the ears of david in hebron all that seemed good to 
israel and that seemed good to the whole house of benjamin 
so abner came to david to hebron and twenty men with him and 
david made abner and the men that were with him a feast 
and abner said unto david i will arise and go and will gather 
all israel unto my lord the king that they may make a league with 
thee and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth 
and david sent abner away and he went in peace 
and behold the servants of david and joab came from pursuing a 
troop and brought in a great spoil with them but abner was not with 
david in hebron for he had sent him away and he was gone in peace 
when joab and all the host that was with him were come they told 
joab saying abner the son of ner came to the king and he hath sent 
him away and he is gone in peace 
then joab came to the king and said what hast thou done 
behold abner came unto thee why is it that thou hast sent him away 
and he is quite gone thou knowest abner the son of ner that he 
came to deceive thee and to know thy going out and thy coming in and 
to know all that thou doest 
and when joab was come out from david he sent messengers after 
abner which brought him again from the well of sirah but david knew 
it not 
and when abner was returned to hebron joab took him aside in the 
gate to speak with him quietly and smote him there under the fifth 
rib that he died for the blood of asahel his brother 
and afterward when david heard it he said i and my kingdom are 
guiltless before the lord for ever from the blood of abner the son of 
ner let it rest on the head of joab and on all his father s 
house and let there not fail from the house of joab one that hath an 
issue or that is a leper or that leaneth on a staff or that falleth 
on the sword or that lacketh bread 
so joab and abishai his brother slew abner because he had slain 
their brother asahel at gibeon in the battle 
and david said to joab and to all the people that were with him 
rend your clothes and gird you with sackcloth and mourn before 
abner and king david himself followed the bier 
and they buried abner in hebron and the king lifted up his 
voice and wept at the grave of abner and all the people wept 
and the king lamented over abner and said died abner as a fool 
dieth thy hands were not bound nor thy feet put into fetters 
as a man falleth before wicked men so fellest thou and all the 
people wept again over him 
and when all the people came to cause david to eat meat while it 
was yet day david sware saying so do god to me and more also if i 
taste bread or ought else till the sun be down 
and all the people took notice of it and it pleased them as 
whatsoever the king did pleased all the people 
for all the people and all israel understood that day that it was 
not of the king to slay abner the son of ner 
and the king said unto his servants know ye not that there is a 
prince and a great man fallen this day in israel and i am this 
day weak though anointed king and these men the sons of zeruiah be 
too hard for me the lord shall reward the doer of evil according to 
his wickedness 
and when saul s son heard that abner was dead in hebron his hands 
were feeble and all the israelites were troubled 
and saul s son had two men that were captains of bands the name 
of the one was baanah and the name of the other rechab the sons of 
rimmon a beerothite of the children of benjamin for beeroth also 
was reckoned to benjamin 
and the beerothites fled to gittaim and were sojourners there 
until this day and jonathan saul s son had a son that was 
lame of his feet he was five years old when the tidings came of saul 
and jonathan out of jezreel and his nurse took him up and fled and 
it came to pass as she made haste to flee that he fell and became 
lame and his name was mephibosheth 
and the sons of rimmon the beerothite rechab and baanah went 
and came about the heat of the day to the house of ishbosheth who lay 
on a bed at noon 
and they came thither into the midst of the house as though they 
would have fetched wheat and they smote him under the fifth rib and 
rechab and baanah his brother escaped 
for when they came into the house he lay on his bed in his 
bedchamber and they smote him and slew him and beheaded him and 
took his head and gat them away through the plain all night 
and they brought the head of ishbosheth unto david to hebron and 
said to the king behold the head of ishbosheth the son of saul thine 
enemy which sought thy life and the lord hath avenged my lord the 
king this day of saul and of his seed 
and david answered rechab and baanah his brother the sons of 
rimmon the beerothite and said unto them as the lord liveth who 
hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity when one told me 
saying behold saul is dead thinking to have brought good tidings i 
took hold of him and slew him in ziklag who thought that i would 
have given him a reward for his tidings how much more when 
wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his 
bed shall i not therefore now require his blood of your hand and 
take you away from the earth and david commanded his young men 
and they slew them and cut off their hands and their feet and hanged 
them up over the pool in hebron but they took the head of ishbosheth 
and buried it in the sepulchre of abner in hebron 
then came all the tribes of israel to david unto hebron and 
spake saying behold we are thy bone and thy flesh 
also in time past when saul was king over us thou wast he that 
leddest out and broughtest in israel and the lord said to thee thou 
shalt feed my people israel and thou shalt be a captain over israel 
so all the elders of israel came to the king to hebron and king 
david made a league with them in hebron before the lord and they 
anointed david king over israel 
david was thirty years old when he began to reign and he reigned 
forty years 
in hebron he reigned over judah seven years and six months and in 
jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all israel and judah 
and the king and his men went to jerusalem unto the jebusites the 
inhabitants of the land which spake unto david saying except thou 
take away the blind and the lame thou shalt not come in hither 
thinking david cannot come in hither 
nevertheless david took the strong hold of zion the same is the 
city of david 
and david said on that day whosoever getteth up to the gutter 
and smiteth the jebusites and the lame and the blind that are hated 
of david s soul he shall be chief and captain wherefore they said 
the blind and the lame shall not come into the house 
so david dwelt in the fort and called it the city of david and 
david built round about from millo and inward 
and david went on and grew great and the lord god of hosts was 
with him 
and hiram king of tyre sent messengers to david and cedar trees 
and carpenters and masons and they built david an house 
and david perceived that the lord had established him king over 
israel and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people israel s 
sake 
and david took him more concubines and wives out of jerusalem 
after he was come from hebron and there were yet sons and daughters 
born to david 
and these be the names of those that were born unto him in 
jerusalem shammuah and shobab and nathan and solomon ibhar 
also and elishua and nepheg and japhia and elishama and 
eliada and eliphalet 
but when the philistines heard that they had anointed david king 
over israel all the philistines came up to seek david and david 
heard of it and went down to the hold 
the philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of 
rephaim 
and david enquired of the lord saying shall i go up to the 
philistines wilt thou deliver them into mine hand and the lord said 
unto david go up for i will doubtless deliver the philistines into 
thine hand 
and david came to baalperazim and david smote them there and 
said the lord hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me as the 
breach of waters therefore he called the name of that place 
baalperazim 
and there they left their images and david and his men burned 
them 
and the philistines came up yet again and spread themselves in 
the valley of rephaim 
and when david enquired of the lord he said thou shalt not go 
up but fetch a compass behind them and come upon them over against 
the mulberry trees 
and let it be when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops 
of the mulberry trees that then thou shalt bestir thyself for then 
shall the lord go out before thee to smite the host of the 
philistines 
and david did so as the lord had commanded him and smote the 
philistines from geba until thou come to gazer 
again david gathered together all the chosen men of israel 
thirty thousand 
and david arose and went with all the people that were with him 
from baale of judah to bring up from thence the ark of god whose 
name is called by the name of the lord of hosts that dwelleth between 
the cherubims 
and they set the ark of god upon a new cart and brought it out of 
the house of abinadab that was in gibeah and uzzah and ahio the sons 
of abinadab drave the new cart 
and they brought it out of the house of abinadab which was at 
gibeah accompanying the ark of god and ahio went before the ark 
and david and all the house of israel played before the lord on 
all manner of instruments made of fir wood even on harps and on 
psalteries and on timbrels and on cornets and on cymbals 
and when they came to nachon s threshingfloor uzzah put forth his 
hand to the ark of god and took hold of it for the oxen shook it 
and the anger of the lord was kindled against uzzah and god smote 
him there for his error and there he died by the ark of god 
and david was displeased because the lord had made a breach upon 
uzzah and he called the name of the place perezuzzah to this day 
and david was afraid of the lord that day and said how shall the 
ark of the lord come to me so david would not remove the ark of 
the lord unto him into the city of david but david carried it aside 
into the house of obededom the gittite 
and the ark of the lord continued in the house of obededom the 
gittite three months and the lord blessed obededom and all his 
household 
and it was told king david saying the lord hath blessed the 
house of obededom and all that pertaineth unto him because of the 
ark of god so david went and brought up the ark of god from the house 
of obededom into the city of david with gladness 
and it was so that when they that bare the ark of the lord had 
gone six paces he sacrificed oxen and fatlings 
and david danced before the lord with all his might and david 
was girded with a linen ephod 
so david and all the house of israel brought up the ark of the 
lord with shouting and with the sound of the trumpet 
and as the ark of the lord came into the city of david michal 
saul s daughter looked through a window and saw king david leaping 
and dancing before the lord and she despised him in her heart 
and they brought in the ark of the lord and set it in his place 
in the midst of the tabernacle that david had pitched for it and 
david offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the lord 
and as soon as david had made an end of offering burnt offerings 
and peace offerings he blessed the people in the name of the lord of 
hosts 
and he dealt among all the people even among the whole multitude 
of israel as well to the women as men to every one a cake of bread 
and a good piece of flesh and a flagon of wine so all the people 
departed every one to his house 
then david returned to bless his household and michal the 
daughter of saul came out to meet david and said how glorious was 
the king of israel to day who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of 
the handmaids of his servants as one of the vain fellows shamelessly 
uncovereth himself and david said unto michal it was before 
the lord which chose me before thy father and before all his house 
to appoint me ruler over the people of the lord over israel 
therefore will i play before the lord 
and i will yet be more vile than thus and will be base in mine 
own sight and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of of them 
shall i be had in honour 
therefore michal the daughter of saul had no child unto the day 
of her death 
and it came to pass when the king sat in his house and the lord 
had given him rest round about from all his enemies that the king 
said unto nathan the prophet see now i dwell in an house of cedar 
but the ark of god dwelleth within curtains 
and nathan said to the king go do all that is in thine heart 
for the lord is with thee 
and it came to pass that night that the word of the lord came 
unto nathan saying go and tell my servant david thus saith the 
lord shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in whereas i 
have not dwelt in any house since the time that i brought up the 
children of israel out of egypt even to this day but have walked in 
a tent and in a tabernacle 
in all the places wherein i have walked with all the children of 
israel spake i a word with any of the tribes of israel whom i 
commanded to feed my people israel saying why build ye not me an 
house of cedar now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant 
david thus saith the lord of hosts i took thee from the sheepcote 
from following the sheep to be ruler over my people over israel 
and i was with thee whithersoever thou wentest and have cut off all 
thine enemies out of thy sight and have made thee a great name like 
unto the name of the great men that are in the earth 
moreover i will appoint a place for my people israel and will 
plant them that they may dwell in a place of their own and move no 
more neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more 
as beforetime and as since the time that i commanded judges to 
be over my people israel and have caused thee to rest from all thine 
enemies also the lord telleth thee that he will make thee an house 
and when thy days be fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with thy 
fathers i will set up thy seed after thee which shall proceed out of 
thy bowels and i will establish his kingdom 
he shall build an house for my name and i will stablish the 
throne of his kingdom for ever 
i will be his father and he shall be my son if he commit 
iniquity i will chasten him with the rod of men and with the stripes 
of the children of men but my mercy shall not depart away from 
him as i took it from saul whom i put away before thee 
and thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever 
before thee thy throne shall be established for ever 
according to all these words and according to all this vision 
so did nathan speak unto david 
then went king david in and sat before the lord and he said 
who am i o lord god and what is my house that thou hast brought me 
hitherto and this was yet a small thing in thy sight o lord 
god but thou hast spoken also of thy servant s house for a great 
while to come and is this the manner of man o lord god and 
what can david say more unto thee for thou lord god knowest thy 
servant 
for thy word s sake and according to thine own heart hast thou 
done all these great things to make thy servant know them 
wherefore thou art great o lord god for there is none like 
thee neither is there any god beside thee according to all that we 
have heard with our ears 
and what one nation in the earth is like thy people even like 
israel whom god went to redeem for a people to himself and to make 
him a name and to do for you great things and terrible for thy land 
before thy people which thou redeemedst to thee from egypt from the 
nations and their gods for thou hast confirmed to thyself thy 
people israel to be a people unto thee for ever and thou lord art 
become their god 
and now o lord god the word that thou hast spoken concerning 
thy servant and concerning his house establish it for ever and do 
as thou hast said 
and let thy name be magnified for ever saying the lord of hosts 
is the god over israel and let the house of thy servant david be 
established before thee 
for thou o lord of hosts god of israel hast revealed to thy 
servant saying i will build thee an house therefore hath thy 
servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee 
and now o lord god thou art that god and thy words be true 
and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant therefore 
now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant that it may 
continue for ever before thee for thou o lord god hast spoken it 
and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for 
ever 
and after this it came to pass that david smote the philistines 
and subdued them and david took methegammah out of the hand of the 
philistines 
and he smote moab and measured them with a line casting them 
down to the ground even with two lines measured he to put to death 
and with one full line to keep alive and so the moabites became 
david s servants and brought gifts 
david smote also hadadezer the son of rehob king of zobah as he 
went to recover his border at the river euphrates 
and david took from him a thousand chariots and seven hundred 
horsemen and twenty thousand footmen and david houghed all the 
chariot horses but reserved of them for an hundred chariots 
and when the syrians of damascus came to succour hadadezer king of 
zobah david slew of the syrians two and twenty thousand men 
then david put garrisons in syria of damascus and the syrians 
became servants to david and brought gifts and the lord preserved 
david whithersoever he went 
and david took the shields of gold that were on the servants of 
hadadezer and brought them to jerusalem 
and from betah and from berothai cities of hadadezer king david 
took exceeding much brass 
when toi king of hamath heard that david had smitten all the host 
of hadadezer then toi sent joram his son unto king david to 
salute him and to bless him because he had fought against hadadezer 
and smitten him for hadadezer had wars with toi and joram brought 
with him vessels of silver and vessels of gold and vessels of brass 
which also king david did dedicate unto the lord with the silver 
and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued 
of syria and of moab and of the children of ammon and of the 
philistines and of amalek and of the spoil of hadadezer son of 
rehob king of zobah 
and david gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the 
syrians in the valley of salt being eighteen thousand men 
and he put garrisons in edom throughout all edom put he 
garrisons and all they of edom became david s servants and the lord 
preserved david whithersoever he went 
and david reigned over all israel and david executed judgment 
and justice unto all his people 
and joab the son of zeruiah was over the host and jehoshaphat 
the son of ahilud was recorder and zadok the son of ahitub and 
ahimelech the son of abiathar were the priests and seraiah was the 
scribe and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over both the 
cherethites and the pelethites and david s sons were chief rulers 
and david said is there yet any that is left of the house of 
saul that i may shew him kindness for jonathan s sake and there 
was of the house of saul a servant whose name was ziba and when they 
had called him unto david the king said unto him art thou ziba and 
he said thy servant is he 
and the king said is there not yet any of the house of saul that 
i may shew the kindness of god unto him and ziba said unto the king 
jonathan hath yet a son which is lame on his feet 
and the king said unto him where is he and ziba said unto the 
king behold he is in the house of machir the son of ammiel in 
lodebar 
then king david sent and fetched him out of the house of machir 
the son of ammiel from lodebar 
now when mephibosheth the son of jonathan the son of saul was 
come unto david he fell on his face and did reverence and david 
said mephibosheth and he answered behold thy servant and 
david said unto him fear not for i will surely shew thee kindness 
for jonathan thy father s sake and will restore thee all the land of 
saul thy father and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually 
and he bowed himself and said what is thy servant that thou 
shouldest look upon such a dead dog as i am then the king called 
to ziba saul s servant and said unto him i have given unto thy 
master s son all that pertained to saul and to all his house 
thou therefore and thy sons and thy servants shall till the 
land for him and thou shalt bring in the fruits that thy master s 
son may have food to eat but mephibosheth thy master s son shall eat 
bread alway at my table now ziba had fifteen sons and twenty 
servants 
then said ziba unto the king according to all that my lord the 
king hath commanded his servant so shall thy servant do as for 
mephibosheth said the king he shall eat at my table as one of the 
king s sons 
and mephibosheth had a young son whose name was micha and all 
that dwelt in the house of ziba were servants unto mephibosheth 
so mephibosheth dwelt in jerusalem for he did eat continually at 
the king s table and was lame on both his feet 
and it came to pass after this that the king of the children of 
ammon died and hanun his son reigned in his stead 
then said david i will shew kindness unto hanun the son of 
nahash as his father shewed kindness unto me and david sent to 
comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father and david s 
servants came into the land of the children of ammon 
and the princes of the children of ammon said unto hanun their 
lord thinkest thou that david doth honour thy father that he hath 
sent comforters unto thee hath not david rather sent his servants 
unto thee to search the city and to spy it out and to overthrow it 
wherefore hanun took david s servants and shaved off the one 
half of their beards and cut off their garments in the middle even 
to their buttocks and sent them away 
when they told it unto david he sent to meet them because the 
men were greatly ashamed and the king said tarry at jericho until 
your beards be grown and then return 
and when the children of ammon saw that they stank before david 
the children of ammon sent and hired the syrians of bethrehob and the 
syrians of zoba twenty thousand footmen and of king maacah a 
thousand men and of ishtob twelve thousand men 
and when david heard of it he sent joab and all the host of the 
mighty men 
and the children of ammon came out and put the battle in array 
at the entering in of the gate and the syrians of zoba and of rehob 
and ishtob and maacah were by themselves in the field 
when joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before 
and behind he chose of all the choice men of israel and put them in 
array against the syrians and the rest of the people he 
delivered into the hand of abishai his brother that he might put them 
in array against the children of ammon 
and he said if the syrians be too strong for me then thou 
shalt help me but if the children of ammon be too strong for thee 
then i will come and help thee 
be of good courage and let us play the men for our people and 
for the cities of our god and the lord do that which seemeth him 
good 
and joab drew nigh and the people that were with him unto the 
battle against the syrians and they fled before him 
and when the children of ammon saw that the syrians were fled 
then fled they also before abishai and entered into the city so joab 
returned from the children of ammon and came to jerusalem 
and when the syrians saw that they were smitten before israel 
they gathered themselves together 
and hadarezer sent and brought out the syrians that were beyond 
the river and they came to helam and shobach the captain of the host 
of hadarezer went before them 
and when it was told david he gathered all israel together and 
passed over jordan and came to helam and the syrians set themselves 
in array against david and fought with him 
and the syrians fled before israel and david slew the men of 
seven hundred chariots of the syrians and forty thousand horsemen 
and smote shobach the captain of their host who died there 
and when all the kings that were servants to hadarezer saw that 
they were smitten before israel they made peace with israel and 
served them so the syrians feared to help the children of ammon any 
more 
and it came to pass after the year was expired at the time when 
kings go forth to battle that david sent joab and his servants with 
him and all israel and they destroyed the children of ammon and 
besieged rabbah but david tarried still at jerusalem 
and it came to pass in an eveningtide that david arose from off 
his bed and walked upon the roof of the king s house and from the 
roof he saw a woman washing herself and the woman was very beautiful 
to look upon 
and david sent and enquired after the woman and one said is not 
this bathsheba the daughter of eliam the wife of uriah the hittite 
and david sent messengers and took her and she came in unto 
him and he lay with her for she was purified from her uncleanness 
and she returned unto her house 
and the woman conceived and sent and told david and said i am 
with child 
and david sent to joab saying send me uriah the hittite and 
joab sent uriah to david 
and when uriah was come unto him david demanded of him how joab 
did and how the people did and how the war prospered 
and david said to uriah go down to thy house and wash thy feet 
and uriah departed out of the king s house and there followed him a 
mess of meat from the king 
but uriah slept at the door of the king s house with all the 
servants of his lord and went not down to his house 
and when they had told david saying uriah went not down unto 
his house david said unto uriah camest thou not from thy journey 
why then didst thou not go down unto thine house and uriah 
said unto david the ark and israel and judah abide in tents and 
my lord joab and the servants of my lord are encamped in the open 
fields shall i then go into mine house to eat and to drink and to 
lie with my wife as thou livest and as thy soul liveth i will not 
do this thing 
and david said to uriah tarry here to day also and to morrow i 
will let thee depart so uriah abode in jerusalem that day and the 
morrow 
and when david had called him he did eat and drink before him 
and he made him drunk and at even he went out to lie on his bed with 
the servants of his lord but went not down to his house 
and it came to pass in the morning that david wrote a letter to 
joab and sent it by the hand of uriah 
and he wrote in the letter saying set ye uriah in the 
forefront of the hottest battle and retire ye from him that he may 
be smitten and die 
and it came to pass when joab observed the city that he 
assigned uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were 
and the men of the city went out and fought with joab and 
there fell some of the people of the servants of david and uriah the 
hittite died also 
then joab sent and told david all the things concerning the war 
and charged the messenger saying when thou hast made an end of 
telling the matters of the war unto the king and if so be that 
the king s wrath arise and he say unto thee wherefore approached ye 
so nigh unto the city when ye did fight knew ye not that they would 
shoot from the wall who smote abimelech the son of 
jerubbesheth did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him 
from the wall that he died in thebez why went ye nigh the wall then 
say thou thy servant uriah the hittite is dead also 
so the messenger went and came and shewed david all that joab 
had sent him for 
and the messenger said unto david surely the men prevailed 
against us and came out unto us into the field and we were upon them 
even unto the entering of the gate 
and the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants and 
some of the king s servants be dead and thy servant uriah the hittite 
is dead also 
then david said unto the messenger thus shalt thou say unto 
joab let not this thing displease thee for the sword devoureth one 
as well as another make thy battle more strong against the city and 
overthrow it and encourage thou him 
and when the wife of uriah heard that uriah her husband was 
dead she mourned for her husband 
and when the mourning was past david sent and fetched her to 
his house and she became his wife and bare him a son but the thing 
that david had done displeased the lord 
and the lord sent nathan unto david and he came unto him and 
said unto him there were two men in one city the one rich and the 
other poor 
the rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds but the 
poor man had nothing save one little ewe lamb which he had bought 
and nourished up and it grew up together with him and with his 
children it did eat of his own meat and drank of his own cup and 
lay in his bosom and was unto him as a daughter 
and there came a traveller unto the rich man and he spared to 
take of his own flock and of his own herd to dress for the wayfaring 
man that was come unto him but took the poor man s lamb and dressed 
it for the man that was come to him 
and david s anger was greatly kindled against the man and he 
said to nathan as the lord liveth the man that hath done this thing 
shall surely die and he shall restore the lamb fourfold because 
he did this thing and because he had no pity 
and nathan said to david thou art the man thus saith the lord 
god of israel i anointed thee king over israel and i delivered thee 
out of the hand of saul and i gave thee thy master s house and 
thy master s wives into thy bosom and gave thee the house of israel 
and of judah and if that had been too little i would moreover have 
given unto thee such and such things 
wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the lord to do 
evil in his sight thou hast killed uriah the hittite with the sword 
and hast taken his wife to be thy wife and hast slain him with the 
sword of the children of ammon 
now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house 
because thou hast despised me and hast taken the wife of uriah the 
hittite to be thy wife 
thus saith the lord behold i will raise up evil against thee 
out of thine own house and i will take thy wives before thine eyes 
and give them unto thy neighbour and he shall lie with thy wives in 
the sight of this sun 
for thou didst it secretly but i will do this thing before all 
israel and before the sun 
and david said unto nathan i have sinned against the lord and 
nathan said unto david the lord also hath put away thy sin thou 
shalt not die 
howbeit because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to 
the enemies of the lord to blaspheme the child also that is born unto 
thee shall surely die 
and nathan departed unto his house and the lord struck the 
child that uriah s wife bare unto david and it was very sick 
david therefore besought god for the child and david fasted 
and went in and lay all night upon the earth 
and the elders of his house arose and went to him to raise him 
up from the earth but he would not neither did he eat bread with 
them 
and it came to pass on the seventh day that the child died and 
the servants of david feared to tell him that the child was dead for 
they said behold while the child was yet alive we spake unto him 
and he would not hearken unto our voice how will he then vex himself 
if we tell him that the child is dead but when david saw that 
his servants whispered david perceived that the child was dead 
therefore david said unto his servants is the child dead and they 
said he is dead 
then david arose from the earth and washed and anointed 
himself and changed his apparel and came into the house of the lord 
and worshipped then he came to his own house and when he required 
they set bread before him and he did eat 
then said his servants unto him what thing is this that thou 
hast done thou didst fast and weep for the child while it was alive 
but when the child was dead thou didst rise and eat bread 
and he said while the child was yet alive i fasted and wept 
for i said who can tell whether god will be gracious to me that the 
child may live but now he is dead wherefore should i fast 
can i bring him back again i shall go to him but he shall not return 
to me 
and david comforted bathsheba his wife and went in unto her 
and lay with her and she bare a son and he called his name solomon 
and the lord loved him 
and he sent by the hand of nathan the prophet and he called his 
name jedidiah because of the lord 
and joab fought against rabbah of the children of ammon and 
took the royal city 
and joab sent messengers to david and said i have fought 
against rabbah and have taken the city of waters 
now therefore gather the rest of the people together and encamp 
against the city and take it lest i take the city and it be called 
after my name 
and david gathered all the people together and went to rabbah 
and fought against it and took it 
and he took their king s crown from off his head the weight 
whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones and it was set 
on david s head and he brought forth the spoil of the city in great 
abundance 
and he brought forth the people that were therein and put them 
under saws and under harrows of iron and under axes of iron and 
made them pass through the brick kiln and thus did he unto all the 
cities of the children of ammon so david and all the people returned 
unto jerusalem 
and it came to pass after this that absalom the son of david had 
a fair sister whose name was tamar and amnon the son of david loved 
her 
and amnon was so vexed that he fell sick for his sister tamar 
for she was a virgin and amnon thought it hard for him to do anything 
to her 
but amnon had a friend whose name was jonadab the son of 
shimeah david s brother and jonadab was a very subtil man 
and he said unto him why art thou being the king s son lean 
from day to day wilt thou not tell me and amnon said unto him i 
love tamar my brother absalom s sister 
and jonadab said unto him lay thee down on thy bed and make 
thyself sick and when thy father cometh to see thee say unto him i 
pray thee let my sister tamar come and give me meat and dress the 
meat in my sight that i may see it and eat it at her hand 
so amnon lay down and made himself sick and when the king was 
come to see him amnon said unto the king i pray thee let tamar my 
sister come and make me a couple of cakes in my sight that i may eat 
at her hand 
then david sent home to tamar saying go now to thy brother 
amnon s house and dress him meat 
so tamar went to her brother amnon s house and he was laid down 
and she took flour and kneaded it and made cakes in his sight and 
did bake the cakes 
and she took a pan and poured them out before him but he 
refused to eat and amnon said have out all men from me and they 
went out every man from him 
and amnon said unto tamar bring the meat into the chamber that 
i may eat of thine hand and tamar took the cakes which she had made 
and brought them into the chamber to amnon her brother 
and when she had brought them unto him to eat he took hold of 
her and said unto her come lie with me my sister 
and she answered him nay my brother do not force me for no 
such thing ought to be done in israel do not thou this folly 
and i whither shall i because my shame to go and as for thee 
thou shalt be as one of the fools in israel now therefore i pray 
thee speak unto the king for he will not withhold me from thee 
howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice but being stronger 
than she forced her and lay with her 
then amnon hated her exceedingly so that the hatred wherewith 
he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her and 
amnon said unto her arise be gone 
and she said unto him there is no because this evil in sending 
me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me but he 
would not hearken unto her 
then he called his servant that ministered unto him and said 
put now this woman out from me and bolt the door after her 
and she had a garment of divers colours upon her for with such 
robes were the king s daughters that were virgins apparelled then his 
servant brought her out and bolted the door after her 
and tamar put ashes on her head and rent her garment of divers 
colours that was on her and laid her hand on her head and went on 
crying 
and absalom her brother said unto her hath amnon thy brother 
been with thee but hold now thy peace my sister he is thy brother 
regard not this thing so tamar remained desolate in her brother 
absalom s house 
but when king david heard of all these things he was very 
wroth 
and absalom spake unto his brother amnon neither good nor bad 
for absalom hated amnon because he had forced his sister tamar 
and it came to pass after two full years that absalom had 
sheepshearers in baalhazor which is beside ephraim and absalom 
invited all the king s sons 
and absalom came to the king and said behold now thy servant 
hath sheepshearers let the king i beseech thee and his servants go 
with thy servant 
and the king said to absalom nay my son let us not all now 
go lest we be chargeable unto thee and he pressed him howbeit he 
would not go but blessed him 
then said absalom if not i pray thee let my brother amnon go 
with us and the king said unto him why should he go with thee 
but absalom pressed him that he let amnon and all the king s 
sons go with him 
now absalom had commanded his servants saying mark ye now when 
amnon s heart is merry with wine and when i say unto you smite 
amnon then kill him fear not have not i commanded you be 
courageous and be valiant 
and the servants of absalom did unto amnon as absalom had 
commanded 
then all the king s sons arose and every man gat him up upon his 
mule and fled 
and it came to pass while they were in the way that tidings 
came to david saying absalom hath slain all the king s sons and 
there is not one of them left 
then the king arose and tare his garments and lay on the 
earth and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent 
and jonadab the son of shimeah david s brother answered and 
said let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men 
the king s sons for amnon only is dead for by the appointment of 
absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his 
sister tamar 
now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his 
heart to think that all the king s sons are dead for amnon only is 
dead 
but absalom fled and the young man that kept the watch lifted 
up his eyes and looked and behold there came much people by the 
way of the hill side behind him 
and jonadab said unto the king behold the king s sons come as 
thy servant said so it is 
and it came to pass as soon as he had made an end of speaking 
that behold the king s sons came and lifted up their voice and 
wept and the king also and all his servants wept very sore 
but absalom fled and went to talmai the son of ammihud king 
of geshur and david mourned for his son every day 
so absalom fled and went to geshur and was there three years 
and the soul of king david longed to go forth unto absalom for 
he was comforted concerning amnon seeing he was dead 
now joab the son of zeruiah perceived that the king s heart was 
toward absalom 
and joab sent to tekoah and fetched thence a wise woman and 
said unto her i pray thee feign thyself to be a mourner and put on 
now mourning apparel and anoint not thyself with oil but be as a 
woman that had a long time mourned for the dead and come to the 
king and speak on this manner unto him so joab put the words in her 
mouth 
and when the woman of tekoah spake to the king she fell on her 
face to the ground and did obeisance and said help o king 
and the king said unto her what aileth thee and she answered i 
am indeed a widow woman and mine husband is dead 
and thy handmaid had two sons and they two strove together in 
the field and there was none to part them but the one smote the 
other and slew him 
and behold the whole family is risen against thine handmaid 
and they said deliver him that smote his brother that we may kill 
him for the life of his brother whom he slew and we will destroy the 
heir also and so they shall quench my coal which is left and shall 
not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth 
and the king said unto the woman go to thine house and i will 
give charge concerning thee 
and the woman of tekoah said unto the king my lord o king the 
iniquity be on me and on my father s house and the king and his 
throne be guiltless 
and the king said whoever saith ought unto thee bring him to 
me and he shall not touch thee any more 
then said she i pray thee let the king remember the lord thy 
god that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy 
any more lest they destroy my son and he said as the lord liveth 
there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth 
then the woman said let thine handmaid i pray thee speak one 
word unto my lord the king and he said say on 
and the woman said wherefore then hast thou thought such a 
thing against the people of god for the king doth speak this thing as 
one which is faulty in that the king doth not fetch home again his 
banished 
for we must needs die and are as water spilt on the ground 
which cannot be gathered up again neither doth god respect any 
person yet doth he devise means that his banished be not expelled 
from him 
now therefore that i am come to speak of this thing unto my lord 
the king it is because the people have made me afraid and thy 
handmaid said i will now speak unto the king it may be that the king 
will perform the request of his handmaid 
for the king will hear to deliver his handmaid out of the hand 
of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the 
inheritance of god 
then thine handmaid said the word of my lord the king shall now 
be comfortable for as an angel of god so is my lord the king to 
discern good and bad therefore the lord thy god will be with thee 
then the king answered and said unto the woman hide not from 
me i pray thee the thing that i shall ask thee and the woman said 
let my lord the king now speak 
and the king said is not the hand of joab with thee in all 
this and the woman answered and said as thy soul liveth my lord 
the king none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought 
that my lord the king hath spoken for thy servant joab he bade me 
and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid to 
fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant joab done this thing 
and my lord is wise according to the wisdom of an angel of god to 
know all things that are in the earth 
and the king said unto joab behold now i have done this thing 
go therefore bring the young man absalom again 
and joab fell to the ground on his face and bowed himself and 
thanked the king and joab said to day thy servant knoweth that i 
have found grace in thy sight my lord o king in that the king hath 
fulfilled the request of his servant 
so joab arose and went to geshur and brought absalom to 
jerusalem 
and the king said let him turn to his own house and let him 
not see my face so absalom returned to his own house and saw not the 
king s face 
but in all israel there was none to be so much praised as 
absalom for his beauty from the sole of his foot even to the crown of 
his head there was no blemish in him 
and when he polled his head for it was at every year s end 
that he polled it because the hair was heavy on him therefore he 
polled it he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels 
after the king s weight 
and unto absalom there were born three sons and one daughter 
whose name was tamar she was a woman of a fair countenance 
so absalom dwelt two full years in jerusalem and saw not the 
king s face 
therefore absalom sent for joab to have sent him to the king 
but he would not come to him and when he sent again the second time 
he would not come 
therefore he said unto his servants see joab s field is near 
mine and he hath barley there go and set it on fire and absalom s 
servants set the field on fire 
then joab arose and came to absalom unto his house and said 
unto him wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire and 
absalom answered joab behold i sent unto thee saying come hither 
that i may send thee to the king to say wherefore am i come from 
geshur it had been good for me to have been there still now 
therefore let me see the king s face and if there be any iniquity in 
me let him kill me 
so joab came to the king and told him and when he had called 
for absalom he came to the king and bowed himself on his face to the 
ground before the king and the king kissed absalom 
and it came to pass after this that absalom prepared him 
chariots and horses and fifty men to run before him 
and absalom rose up early and stood beside the way of the gate 
and it was so that when any man that had a controversy came to the 
king for judgment then absalom called unto him and said of what 
city art thou and he said thy servant is of one of the tribes of 
israel 
and absalom said unto him see thy matters are good and right 
but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee 
absalom said moreover oh that i were made judge in the land 
that every man which hath any suit or because might come unto me and i 
would do him justice and it was so that when any man came nigh 
to him to do him obeisance he put forth his hand and took him and 
kissed him 
and on this manner did absalom to all israel that came to the 
king for judgment so absalom stole the hearts of the men of israel 
and it came to pass after forty years that absalom said unto the 
king i pray thee let me go and pay my vow which i have vowed unto 
the lord in hebron 
for thy servant vowed a vow while i abode at geshur in syria 
saying if the lord shall bring me again indeed to jerusalem then i 
will serve the lord 
and the king said unto him go in peace so he arose and went to 
hebron 
but absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of israel 
saying as soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet then ye shall 
say absalom reigneth in hebron 
and with absalom went two hundred men out of jerusalem that 
were called and they went in their simplicity and they knew not any 
thing 
and absalom sent for ahithophel the gilonite david s 
counsellor from his city even from giloh while he offered 
sacrifices and the conspiracy was strong for the people increased 
continually with absalom 
and there came a messenger to david saying the hearts of the 
men of israel are after absalom 
and david said unto all his servants that were with him at 
jerusalem arise and let us flee for we shall not else escape from 
absalom make speed to depart lest he overtake us suddenly and bring 
evil upon us and smite the city with the edge of the sword 
and the king s servants said unto the king behold thy servants 
are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint 
and the king went forth and all his household after him and 
the king left ten women which were concubines to keep the house 
and the king went forth and all the people after him and 
tarried in a place that was far off 
and all his servants passed on beside him and all the 
cherethites and all the pelethites and all the gittites six hundred 
men which came after him from gath passed on before the king 
then said the king to ittai the gittite wherefore goest thou 
also with us return to thy place and abide with the king for thou 
art a stranger and also an exile 
whereas thou camest but yesterday should i this day make thee 
go up and down with us seeing i go whither i may return thou and 
take back thy brethren mercy and truth be with thee 
and ittai answered the king and said as the lord liveth and 
as my lord the king liveth surely in what place my lord the king 
shall be whether in death or life even there also will thy servant 
be 
and david said to ittai go and pass over and ittai the gittite 
passed over and all his men and all the little ones that were with 
him 
and all the country wept with a loud voice and all the people 
passed over the king also himself passed over the brook kidron and 
all the people passed over toward the way of the wilderness 
and lo zadok also and all the levites were with him bearing 
the ark of the covenant of god and they set down the ark of god and 
abiathar went up until all the people had done passing out of the 
city 
and the king said unto zadok carry back the ark of god into the 
city if i shall find favour in the eyes of the lord he will bring me 
again and shew me both it and his habitation but if he thus 
say i have no delight in thee behold here am i let him do to me as 
seemeth good unto him 
the king said also unto zadok the priest art not thou a seer 
return into the city in peace and your two sons with you ahimaaz thy 
son and jonathan the son of abiathar 
see i will tarry in the plain of the wilderness until there 
come word from you to certify me 
zadok therefore and abiathar carried the ark of god again to 
jerusalem and they tarried there 
and david went up by the ascent of mount olivet and wept as he 
went up and had his head covered and he went barefoot and all the 
people that was with him covered every man his head and they went up 
weeping as they went up 
and one told david saying ahithophel is among the conspirators 
with absalom and david said o lord i pray thee turn the counsel of 
ahithophel into foolishness 
and it came to pass that when david was come to the top of the 
mount where he worshipped god behold hushai the archite came to 
meet him with his coat rent and earth upon his head unto whom 
david said if thou passest on with me then thou shalt be a burden 
unto me but if thou return to the city and say unto absalom i 
will be thy servant o king as i have been thy father s servant 
hitherto so will i now also be thy servant then mayest thou for me 
defeat the counsel of ahithophel 
and hast thou not there with thee zadok and abiathar the 
priests therefore it shall be that what thing soever thou shalt 
hear out of the king s house thou shalt tell it to zadok and abiathar 
the priests 
behold they have there with them their two sons ahimaaz 
zadok s son and jonathan abiathar s son and by them ye shall send 
unto me every thing that ye can hear 
so hushai david s friend came into the city and absalom came 
into jerusalem 
and when david was a little past the top of the hill behold 
ziba the servant of mephibosheth met him with a couple of asses 
saddled and upon them two hundred loaves of bread and an hundred 
bunches of raisins and an hundred of summer fruits and a bottle of 
wine 
and the king said unto ziba what meanest thou by these and ziba 
said the asses be for the king s household to ride on and the bread 
and summer fruit for the young men to eat and the wine that such as 
be faint in the wilderness may drink 
and the king said and where is thy master s son and ziba said 
unto the king behold he abideth at jerusalem for he said to day 
shall the house of israel restore me the kingdom of my father 
then said the king to ziba behold thine are all that pertained 
unto mephibosheth and ziba said i humbly beseech thee that i may 
find grace in thy sight my lord o king 
and when king david came to bahurim behold thence came out a 
man of the family of the house of saul whose name was shimei the son 
of gera he came forth and cursed still as he came 
and he cast stones at david and at all the servants of king 
david and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right 
hand and on his left 
and thus said shimei when he cursed come out come out thou 
bloody man and thou man of belial the lord hath returned upon 
thee all the blood of the house of saul in whose stead thou hast 
reigned and the lord hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of 
absalom thy son and behold thou art taken in thy mischief because 
thou art a bloody man 
then said abishai the son of zeruiah unto the king why should 
this dead dog curse my lord the king let me go over i pray thee and 
take off his head 
and the king said what have i to do with you ye sons of 
zeruiah so let him curse because the lord hath said unto him curse 
david who shall then say wherefore hast thou done so and 
david said to abishai and to all his servants behold my son which 
came forth of my bowels seeketh my life how much more now may this 
benjamite do it let him alone and let him curse for the lord hath 
bidden him 
it may be that the lord will look on mine affliction and that 
the lord will requite me good for his cursing this day 
and as david and his men went by the way shimei went along on 
the hill s side over against him and cursed as he went and threw 
stones at him and cast dust 
and the king and all the people that were with him came weary 
and refreshed themselves there 
and absalom and all the people the men of israel came to 
jerusalem and ahithophel with him 
and it came to pass when hushai the archite david s friend 
was come unto absalom that hushai said unto absalom god save the 
king god save the king 
and absalom said to hushai is this thy kindness to thy friend 
why wentest thou not with thy friend and hushai said unto 
absalom nay but whom the lord and this people and all the men of 
israel choose his will i be and with him will i abide 
and again whom should i serve should i not serve in the 
presence of his son as i have served in thy father s presence so 
will i be in thy presence 
then said absalom to ahithophel give counsel among you what we 
shall do 
and ahithophel said unto absalom go in unto thy father s 
concubines which he hath left to keep the house and all israel shall 
hear that thou art abhorred of thy father then shall the hands of all 
that are with thee be strong 
so they spread absalom a tent upon the top of the house and 
absalom went in unto his father s concubines in the sight of all 
israel 
and the counsel of ahithophel which he counselled in those 
days was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of god so was all 
the counsel of ahithophel both with david and with absalom 
moreover ahithophel said unto absalom let me now choose out 
twelve thousand men and i will arise and pursue after david this 
night and i will come upon him while he is weary and weak 
handed and will make him afraid and all the people that are with him 
shall flee and i will smite the king only and i will bring back 
all the people unto thee the man whom thou seekest is as if all 
returned so all the people shall be in peace 
and the saying pleased absalom well and all the elders of 
israel 
then said absalom call now hushai the archite also and let us 
hear likewise what he saith 
and when hushai was come to absalom absalom spake unto him 
saying ahithophel hath spoken after this manner shall we do after 
his saying if not speak thou 
and hushai said unto absalom the counsel that ahithophel hath 
given is not good at this time 
for said hushai thou knowest thy father and his men that they 
be mighty men and they be chafed in their minds as a bear robbed of 
her whelps in the field and thy father is a man of war and will not 
lodge with the people 
behold he is hid now in some pit or in some other place and it 
will come to pass when some of them be overthrown at the first that 
whosoever heareth it will say there is a slaughter among the people 
that follow absalom 
and he also that is valiant whose heart is as the heart of a 
lion shall utterly melt for all israel knoweth that thy father is a 
mighty man and they which be with him are valiant men 
therefore i counsel that all israel be generally gathered unto 
thee from dan even to beersheba as the sand that is by the sea for 
multitude and that thou go to battle in thine own person 
so shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found 
and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground and of 
him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so 
much as one 
moreover if he be gotten into a city then shall all israel 
bring ropes to that city and we will draw it into the river until 
there be not one small stone found there 
and absalom and all the men of israel said the counsel of 
hushai the archite is better than the counsel of ahithophel for the 
lord had appointed to defeat the good counsel of ahithophel to the 
intent that the lord might bring evil upon absalom 
then said hushai unto zadok and to abiathar the priests thus 
and thus did ahithophel counsel absalom and the elders of israel and 
thus and thus have i counselled 
now therefore send quickly and tell david saying lodge not 
this night in the plains of the wilderness but speedily pass over 
lest the king be swallowed up and all the people that are with him 
now jonathan and ahimaaz stayed by enrogel for they might not 
be seen to come into the city and a wench went and told them and 
they went and told king david 
nevertheless a lad saw them and told absalom but they went 
both of them away quickly and came to a man s house in bahurim which 
had a well in his court whither they went down 
and the woman took and spread a covering over the well s mouth 
and spread ground corn thereon and the thing was not known 
and when absalom s servants came to the woman to the house they 
said where is ahimaaz and jonathan and the woman said unto them 
they be gone over the brook of water and when they had sought and 
could not find them they returned to jerusalem 
and it came to pass after they were departed that they came up 
out of the well and went and told king david and said unto david 
arise and pass quickly over the water for thus hath ahithophel 
counselled against you 
then david arose and all the people that were with him and 
they passed over jordan by the morning light there lacked not one of 
them that was not gone over jordan 
and when ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed he 
saddled his ass and arose and gat him home to his house to his 
city and put his household in order and hanged himself and died 
and was buried in the sepulchre of his father 
then david came to mahanaim and absalom passed over jordan he 
and all the men of israel with him 
and absalom made amasa captain of the host instead of joab 
which amasa was a man s son whose name was ithra an israelite that 
went in to abigail the daughter of nahash sister to zeruiah joab s 
mother 
so israel and absalom pitched in the land of gilead 
and it came to pass when david was come to mahanaim that shobi 
the son of nahash of rabbah of the children of ammon and machir the 
son of ammiel of lodebar and barzillai the gileadite of rogelim 
brought beds and basons and earthen vessels and wheat and 
barley and flour and parched corn and beans and lentiles and 
parched pulse and honey and butter and sheep and cheese of 
kine for david and for the people that were with him to eat for 
they said the people is hungry and weary and thirsty in the 
wilderness 
and david numbered the people that were with him and set 
captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them 
and david sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of 
joab and a third part under the hand of abishai the son of zeruiah 
joab s brother and a third part under the hand of ittai the gittite 
and the king said unto the people i will surely go forth with you 
myself also 
but the people answered thou shalt not go forth for if we flee 
away they will not care for us neither if half of us die will they 
care for us but now thou art worth ten thousand of us therefore now 
it is better that thou succour us out of the city 
and the king said unto them what seemeth you best i will do and 
the king stood by the gate side and all the people came out by 
hundreds and by thousands 
and the king commanded joab and abishai and ittai saying deal 
gently for my sake with the young man even with absalom and all the 
people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning 
absalom 
so the people went out into the field against israel and the 
battle was in the wood of ephraim where the people of israel 
were slain before the servants of david and there was there a great 
slaughter that day of twenty thousand men 
for the battle was there scattered over the face of all the 
country and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword 
devoured 
and absalom met the servants of david and absalom rode upon a 
mule and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak and his 
head caught hold of the oak and he was taken up between the heaven 
and the earth and the mule that was under him went away 
and a certain man saw it and told joab and said behold i saw 
absalom hanged in an oak 
and joab said unto the man that told him and behold thou 
sawest him and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground and 
i would have given thee ten shekels of silver and a girdle 
and the man said unto joab though i should receive a thousand 
shekels of silver in mine hand yet would i not put forth mine hand 
against the king s son for in our hearing the king charged thee and 
abishai and ittai saying beware that none touch the young man 
absalom 
otherwise i should have wrought falsehood against mine own life 
for there is no matter hid from the king and thou thyself wouldest 
have set thyself against me 
then said joab i may not tarry thus with thee and he took 
three darts in his hand and thrust them through the heart of absalom 
while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak 
and ten young men that bare joab s armour compassed about and 
smote absalom and slew him 
and joab blew the trumpet and the people returned from pursuing 
after israel for joab held back the people 
and they took absalom and cast him into a great pit in the 
wood and laid a very great heap of stones upon him and all israel 
fled every one to his tent 
now absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself 
a pillar which is in the king s dale for he said i have no son to 
keep my name in remembrance and he called the pillar after his own 
name and it is called unto this day absalom s place 
then said ahimaaz the son of zadok let me now run and bear the 
king tidings how that the lord hath avenged him of his enemies 
and joab said unto him thou shalt not bear tidings this day 
but thou shalt bear tidings another day but this day thou shalt bear 
no tidings because the king s son is dead 
then said joab to cushi go tell the king what thou hast seen 
and cushi bowed himself unto joab and ran 
then said ahimaaz the son of zadok yet again to joab but 
howsoever let me i pray thee also run after cushi and joab said 
wherefore wilt thou run my son seeing that thou hast no tidings 
ready but howsoever said he let me run and he said unto 
him run then ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain and overran cushi 
and david sat between the two gates and the watchman went up to 
the roof over the gate unto the wall and lifted up his eyes and 
looked and behold a man running alone 
and the watchman cried and told the king and the king said if 
he be alone there is tidings in his mouth and he came apace and 
drew near 
and the watchman saw another man running and the watchman 
called unto the porter and said behold another man running alone 
and the king said he also bringeth tidings 
and the watchman said me thinketh the running of the foremost 
is like the running of ahimaaz the son of zadok and the king said he 
is a good man and cometh with good tidings 
and ahimaaz called and said unto the king all is well and he 
fell down to the earth upon his face before the king and said 
blessed be the lord thy god which hath delivered up the men that 
lifted up their hand against my lord the king 
and the king said is the young man absalom safe and ahimaaz 
answered when joab sent the king s servant and me thy servant i saw 
a great tumult but i knew not what it was 
and the king said unto him turn aside and stand here and he 
turned aside and stood still 
and behold cushi came and cushi said tidings my lord the 
king for the lord hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up 
against thee 
and the king said unto cushi is the young man absalom safe and 
cushi answered the enemies of my lord the king and all that rise 
against thee to do thee hurt be as that young man is 
and the king was much moved and went up to the chamber over the 
gate and wept and as he went thus he said o my son absalom my 
son my son absalom would god i had died for thee o absalom my son 
my son and it was told joab behold the king weepeth and 
mourneth for absalom 
and the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the 
people for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for 
his son 
and the people gat them by stealth that day into the city as 
people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle 
but the king covered his face and the king cried with a loud 
voice o my son absalom o absalom my son my son and joab 
came into the house to the king and said thou hast shamed this day 
the faces of all thy servants which this day have saved thy life and 
the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters and the lives of thy 
wives and the lives of thy concubines in that thou lovest thine 
enemies and hatest thy friends for thou hast declared this day that 
thou regardest neither princes nor servants for this day i perceive 
that if absalom had lived and all we had died this day then it had 
pleased thee well 
now therefore arise go forth and speak comfortably unto thy 
servants for i swear by the lord if thou go not forth there will 
not tarry one with thee this night and that will be worse unto thee 
than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now 
then the king arose and sat in the gate and they told unto all 
the people saying behold the king doth sit in the gate and all the 
people came before the king for israel had fled every man to his 
tent 
and all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of 
israel saying the king saved us out of the hand of our enemies and 
he delivered us out of the hand of the philistines and now he is fled 
out of the land for absalom 
and absalom whom we anointed over us is dead in battle now 
therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back 
and king david sent to zadok and to abiathar the priests saying 
speak unto the elders of judah saying why are ye the last to bring 
the king back to his house seeing the speech of all israel is come to 
the king even to his house 
ye are my brethren ye are my bones and my flesh wherefore then 
are ye the last to bring back the king and say ye to amasa 
art thou not of my bone and of my flesh god do so to me and more 
also if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the 
room of joab 
and he bowed the heart of all the men of judah even as the 
heart of one man so that they sent this word unto the king return 
thou and all thy servants 
so the king returned and came to jordan and judah came to 
gilgal to go to meet the king to conduct the king over jordan 
and shimei the son of gera a benjamite which was of bahurim 
hasted and came down with the men of judah to meet king david 
and there were a thousand men of benjamin with him and ziba the 
servant of the house of saul and his fifteen sons and his twenty 
servants with him and they went over jordan before the king 
and there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king s 
household and to do what he thought good and shimei the son of gera 
fell down before the king as he was come over jordan and said 
unto the king let not my lord impute iniquity unto me neither do 
thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my 
lord the king went out of jerusalem that the king should take it to 
his heart 
for thy servant doth know that i have sinned therefore behold 
i am come the first this day of all the house of joseph to go down to 
meet my lord the king 
but abishai the son of zeruiah answered and said shall not 
shimei be put to death for this because he cursed the lord s 
anointed and david said what have i to do with you ye sons 
of zeruiah that ye should this day be adversaries unto me shall 
there any man be put to death this day in israel for do not i know 
that i am this day king over israel therefore the king said 
unto shimei thou shalt not die and the king sware unto him 
and mephibosheth the son of saul came down to meet the king and 
had neither dressed his feet nor trimmed his beard nor washed his 
clothes from the day the king departed until the day he came again in 
peace 
and it came to pass when he was come to jerusalem to meet the 
king that the king said unto him wherefore wentest not thou with me 
mephibosheth and he answered my lord o king my servant 
deceived me for thy servant said i will saddle me an ass that i may 
ride thereon and go to the king because thy servant is lame 
and he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king but my 
lord the king is as an angel of god do therefore what is good in 
thine eyes 
for all of my father s house were but dead men before my lord 
the king yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at 
thine own table what right therefore have i yet to cry any more unto 
the king and the king said unto him why speakest thou any 
more of thy matters i have said thou and ziba divide the land 
and mephibosheth said unto the king yea let him take all 
forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own 
house 
and barzillai the gileadite came down from rogelim and went 
over jordan with the king to conduct him over jordan 
now barzillai was a very aged man even fourscore years old and 
he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at mahanaim for 
he was a very great man 
and the king said unto barzillai come thou over with me and i 
will feed thee with me in jerusalem 
and barzillai said unto the king how long have i to live that 
i should go up with the king unto jerusalem i am this day 
fourscore years old and can i discern between good and evil can thy 
servant taste what i eat or what i drink can i hear any more the 
voice of singing men and singing women wherefore then should thy 
servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king thy servant will 
go a little way over jordan with the king and why should the king 
recompense it me with such a reward let thy servant i pray 
thee turn back again that i may die in mine own city and be buried 
by the grave of my father and of my mother but behold thy servant 
chimham let him go over with my lord the king and do to him what 
shall seem good unto thee 
and the king answered chimham shall go over with me and i will 
do to him that which shall seem good unto thee and whatsoever thou 
shalt require of me that will i do for thee 
and all the people went over jordan and when the king was come 
over the king kissed barzillai and blessed him and he returned unto 
his own place 
then the king went on to gilgal and chimham went on with him 
and all the people of judah conducted the king and also half the 
people of israel 
and behold all the men of israel came to the king and said 
unto the king why have our brethren the men of judah stolen thee 
away and have brought the king and his household and all david s 
men with him over jordan and all the men of judah answered 
the men of israel because the king is near of kin to us wherefore 
then be ye angry for this matter have we eaten at all of the king s 
cost or hath he given us any gift and the men of israel 
answered the men of judah and said we have ten parts in the king 
and we have also more right in david than ye why then did ye despise 
us that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king 
and the words of the men of judah were fiercer than the words of the 
men of israel 
and there happened to be there a man of belial whose name was 
sheba the son of bichri a benjamite and he blew a trumpet and 
said we have no part in david neither have we inheritance in the son 
of jesse every man to his tents o israel 
so every man of israel went up from after david and followed 
sheba the son of bichri but the men of judah clave unto their king 
from jordan even to jerusalem 
and david came to his house at jerusalem and the king took the 
ten women his concubines whom he had left to keep the house and put 
them in ward and fed them but went not in unto them so they were 
shut up unto the day of their death living in widowhood 
then said the king to amasa assemble me the men of judah within 
three days and be thou here present 
so amasa went to assemble the men of judah but he tarried longer 
than the set time which he had appointed him 
and david said to abishai now shall sheba the son of bichri do 
us more harm than did absalom take thou thy lord s servants and 
pursue after him lest he get him fenced cities and escape us 
and there went out after him joab s men and the cherethites and 
the pelethites and all the mighty men and they went out of 
jerusalem to pursue after sheba the son of bichri 
when they were at the great stone which is in gibeon amasa went 
before them and joab s garment that he had put on was girded unto 
him and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the 
sheath thereof and as he went forth it fell out 
and joab said to amasa art thou in health my brother and joab 
took amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him 
but amasa took no heed to the sword that was in joab s hand so 
he smote him therewith in the fifth rib and she would out his bowels to 
the ground and struck him not again and he died so joab and abishai 
his brother pursued after sheba the son of bichri 
and one of joab s men stood by him and said he that favoureth 
joab and he that is for david let him go after joab 
and amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway and 
when the man saw that all the people stood still he removed amasa out 
of the highway into the field and cast a cloth upon him when he saw 
that every one that came by him stood still 
when he was removed out of the highway all the people went on 
after joab to pursue after sheba the son of bichri 
and he went through all the tribes of israel unto abel and to 
bethmaachah and all the berites and they were gathered together and 
went also after him 
and they came and besieged him in abel of bethmaachah and they 
cast up a bank against the city and it stood in the trench and all 
the people that were with joab battered the wall to throw it down 
then cried a wise woman out of the city hear hear say i pray 
you unto joab come near hither that i may speak with thee 
and when he was come near unto her the woman said art thou 
joab and he answered i am he then she said unto him hear the 
words of thine handmaid and he answered i do hear 
then she spake saying they were will not to speak in old time 
saying they shall surely ask counsel at abel and so they ended the 
matter 
i am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in israel thou 
seekest to destroy a city and a mother in israel why wilt thou 
swallow up the inheritance of the lord and joab answered and 
said far be it far be it from me that i should swallow up or 
destroy 
the matter is not so but a man of mount ephraim sheba the son 
of bichri by name hath lifted up his hand against the king even 
against david deliver him only and i will depart from the city and 
the woman said unto joab behold his head shall be thrown to thee 
over the wall 
then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom and they 
cut off the head of sheba the son of bichri and cast it out to joab 
and he blew a trumpet and they retired from the city every man to 
his tent and joab returned to jerusalem unto the king 
now joab was over all the host of israel and benaiah the son of 
jehoiada was over the cherethites and over the pelethites and 
adoram was over the tribute and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud was 
recorder and sheva was scribe and zadok and abiathar were the 
priests and ira also the jairite was a chief ruler about david 
then there was a famine in the days of david three years year 
after year and david enquired of the lord and the lord answered it 
is for saul and for his bloody house because he slew the gibeonites 
and the king called the gibeonites and said unto them now the 
gibeonites were not of the children of israel but of the remnant of 
the amorites and the children of israel had sworn unto them and saul 
sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of israel and judah 
wherefore david said unto the gibeonites what shall i do for 
you and wherewith shall i make the atonement that ye may bless the 
inheritance of the lord and the gibeonites said unto him we 
will have no silver nor gold of saul nor of his house neither for us 
shalt thou kill any man in israel and he said what ye shall say 
that will i do for you 
and they answered the king the man that consumed us and that 
devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any 
of the coasts of israel let seven men of his sons be delivered 
unto us and we will hang them up unto the lord in gibeah of saul 
whom the lord did choose and the king said i will give them 
but the king spared mephibosheth the son of jonathan the son of 
saul because of the lord s oath that was between them between david 
and jonathan the son of saul 
but the king took the two sons of rizpah the daughter of aiah 
whom she bare unto saul armoni and mephibosheth and the five sons of 
michal the daughter of saul whom she brought up for adriel the son of 
barzillai the meholathite and he delivered them into the hands 
of the gibeonites and they hanged them in the hill before the lord 
and they fell all seven together and were put to death in the days of 
harvest in the first days in the beginning of barley harvest 
and rizpah the daughter of aiah took sackcloth and spread it 
for her upon the rock from the beginning of harvest until water 
dropped upon them out of heaven and suffered neither the birds of the 
air to rest on them by day nor the beasts of the field by night 
and it was told david what rizpah the daughter of aiah the 
concubine of saul had done 
and david went and took the bones of saul and the bones of 
jonathan his son from the men of jabeshgilead which had stolen them 
from the street of bethshan where the philistines had hanged them 
when the philistines had slain saul in gilboa and he brought up 
from thence the bones of saul and the bones of jonathan his son and 
they gathered the bones of them that were hanged 
and the bones of saul and jonathan his son buried they in the 
country of benjamin in zelah in the sepulchre of kish his father and 
they performed all that the king commanded and after that god was 
intreated for the land 
moreover the philistines had yet war again with israel and 
david went down and his servants with him and fought against the 
philistines and david waxed faint 
and ishbibenob which was of the sons of the giant the weight 
of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight he 
being girded with a new sword thought to have slain david 
but abishai the son of zeruiah succoured him and smote the 
philistine and killed him then the men of david sware unto him 
saying thou shalt go no more out with us to battle that thou quench 
not the light of israel 
and it came to pass after this that there was again a battle 
with the philistines at gob then sibbechai the hushathite slew saph 
which was of the sons of the giant 
and there was again a battle in gob with the philistines where 
elhanan the son of jaareoregim a bethlehemite slew the brother of 
goliath the gittite the staff of whose spear was like a weaver s 
beam 
and there was yet a battle in gath where was a man of great 
stature that had on every hand six fingers and on every foot six 
toes four and twenty in number and he also was born to the giant 
and when he defied israel jonathan the son of shimeah the 
brother of david slew him 
these four were born to the giant in gath and fell by the hand 
of david and by the hand of his servants 
and david spake unto the lord the words of this song in the day 
that the lord had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies 
and out of the hand of saul and he said the lord is my rock 
and my fortress and my deliverer the god of my rock in him 
will i trust he is my shield and the horn of my salvation my high 
tower and my refuge my saviour thou savest me from violence 
i will call on the lord who is worthy to be praised so shall i 
be saved from mine enemies 
when the waves of death compassed me the floods of ungodly men 
made me afraid the sorrows of hell compassed me about the 
snares of death prevented me in my distress i called upon the 
lord and cried to my god and he did hear my voice out of his temple 
and my cry did enter into his ears 
then the earth shook and trembled the foundations of heaven 
moved and shook because he was wroth 
there went up a smoke out of his nostrils and fire out of his 
mouth devoured coals were kindled by it 
he bowed the heavens also and came down and darkness was under 
his feet 
and he rode upon a cherub and did fly and he was seen upon the 
wings of the wind 
and he made darkness pavilions round about him dark waters and 
thick clouds of the skies 
through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled 
the lord thundered from heaven and the most high uttered his 
voice 
and he sent out arrows and scattered them lightning and 
discomfited them 
and the channels of the sea appeared the foundations of the 
world were discovered at the rebuking of the lord at the blast of 
the breath of his nostrils 
he sent from above he took me he drew me out of many waters 
he delivered me from my strong enemy and from them that hated 
me for they were too strong for me 
they prevented me in the day of my calamity but the lord was my 
stay 
he brought me forth also into a large place he delivered me 
because he delighted in me 
the lord rewarded me according to my righteousness according to 
the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me 
for i have kept the ways of the lord and have not wickedly 
departed from my god 
for all his judgments were before me and as for his statutes i 
did not depart from them 
i was also upright before him and have kept myself from mine 
iniquity 
therefore the lord hath recompensed me according to my 
righteousness according to my cleanness in his eye sight 
with the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful and with the 
upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright 
with the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure and with the froward 
thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury 
and the afflicted people thou wilt save but thine eyes are upon 
the haughty that thou mayest bring them down 
for thou art my lamp o lord and the lord will lighten my 
darkness 
for by thee i have run through a troop by my god have i leaped 
over a wall 
as for god his way is perfect the word of the lord is tried 
he is a buckler to all them that trust in him 
for who is god save the lord and who is a rock save our god 
god is my strength and power and he maketh my way perfect 
he maketh my feet like hinds feet and setteth me upon my high 
places 
he teacheth my hands to war so that a bow of steel is broken by 
mine arms 
thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation and thy 
gentleness hath made me great 
thou hast enlarged my steps under me so that my feet did not 
slip 
i have pursued mine enemies and destroyed them and turned not 
again until i had consumed them 
and i have consumed them and wounded them that they could not 
arise yea they are fallen under my feet 
for thou hast girded me with strength to battle them that rose 
up against me hast thou subdued under me 
thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies that i might 
destroy them that hate me 
they looked but there was none to save even unto the lord but 
he answered them not 
then did i beat them as small as the dust of the earth i did 
stamp them as the mire of the street and did spread them abroad 
thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people 
thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen a people which i knew not 
shall serve me 
strangers shall submit themselves unto me as soon as they hear 
they shall be obedient unto me 
strangers shall fade away and they shall be afraid out of their 
close places 
the lord liveth and blessed be my rock and exalted be the god 
of the rock of my salvation 
it is god that avengeth me and that bringeth down the people 
under me 
and that bringeth me forth from mine enemies thou also hast 
lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me thou hast 
delivered me from the violent man 
therefore i will give thanks unto thee o lord among the 
heathen and i will sing praises unto thy name 
he is the tower of salvation for his king and sheweth mercy to 
his anointed unto david and to his seed for evermore 
now these be the last words of david david the son of jesse 
said and the man who was raised up on high the anointed of the god 
of jacob and the sweet psalmist of israel said the spirit of 
the lord spake by me and his word was in my tongue 
the god of israel said the rock of israel spake to me he that 
ruleth over men must be just ruling in the fear of god 
and he shall be as the light of the morning when the sun riseth 
even a morning without clouds as the tender grass springing out of 
the earth by clear shining after rain 
although my house be not so with god yet he hath made with me an 
everlasting covenant ordered in all things and sure for this is all 
my salvation and all my desire although he make it not to grow 
but the sons of belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust 
away because they cannot be taken with hands but the man that 
shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear 
and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place 
these be the names of the mighty men whom david had the 
tachmonite that sat in the seat chief among the captains the same 
was adino the eznite he lift up his spear against eight hundred whom 
he slew at one time 
and after him was eleazar the son of dodo the ahohite one of the 
three mighty men with david when they defied the philistines that 
were there gathered together to battle and the men of israel were 
gone away he arose and smote the philistines until his hand 
was weary and his hand clave unto the sword and the lord wrought a 
great victory that day and the people returned after him only to 
spoil 
and after him was shammah the son of agee the hararite and the 
philistines were gathered together into a troop where was a piece of 
ground full of lentiles and the people fled from the philistines 
but he stood in the midst of the ground and defended it and 
slew the philistines and the lord wrought a great victory 
and three of the thirty chief went down and came to david in 
the harvest time unto the cave of adullam and the troop of the 
philistines pitched in the valley of rephaim 
and david was then in an hold and the garrison of the 
philistines was then in bethlehem 
and david longed and said oh that one would give me drink of 
the water of the well of bethlehem which is by the gate and 
the three mighty men brake through the host of the philistines and 
drew water out of the well of bethlehem that was by the gate and 
took it and brought it to david nevertheless he would not drink 
thereof but poured it out unto the lord 
and he said be it far from me o lord that i should do this 
is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives 
therefore he would not drink it these things did these three mighty 
men 
and abishai the brother of joab the son of zeruiah was chief 
among three and he lifted up his spear against three hundred and 
slew them and had the name among three 
was he not most honourable of three therefore he was their 
captain howbeit he attained not unto the first three 
and benaiah the son of jehoiada the son of a valiant man of 
kabzeel who had done many acts he slew two lionlike men of moab he 
went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow 
and he slew an egyptian a goodly man and the egyptian had a 
spear in his hand but he went down to him with a staff and plucked 
the spear out of the egyptian s hand and slew him with his own spear 
these things did benaiah the son of jehoiada and had the name 
among three mighty men 
he was more honourable than the thirty but he attained not to 
the first three and david set him over his guard 
asahel the brother of joab was one of the thirty elhanan the 
son of dodo of bethlehem shammah the harodite elika the 
harodite helez the paltite ira the son of ikkesh the tekoite 
abiezer the anethothite mebunnai the hushathite zalmon 
the ahohite maharai the netophathite heleb the son of baanah 
a netophathite ittai the son of ribai out of gibeah of the children 
of benjamin benaiah the pirathonite hiddai of the brooks of 
gaash abialbon the arbathite azmaveth the barhumite 
eliahba the shaalbonite of the sons of jashen jonathan 
shammah the hararite ahiam the son of sharar the hararite 
eliphelet the son of ahasbai the son of the maachathite eliam the 
son of ahithophel the gilonite hezrai the carmelite paarai the 
arbite igal the son of nathan of zobah bani the gadite 
zelek the ammonite nahari the beerothite armourbearer to joab the 
son of zeruiah ira an ithrite gareb an ithrite uriah 
the hittite thirty and seven in all 
and again the anger of the lord was kindled against israel and 
he moved david against them to say go number israel and judah 
for the king said to joab the captain of the host which was with 
him go now through all the tribes of israel from dan even to 
beersheba and number ye the people that i may know the number of the 
people 
and joab said unto the king now the lord thy god add unto the 
people how many soever they be an hundredfold and that the eyes of 
my lord the king may see it but why doth my lord the king delight in 
this thing notwithstanding the king s word prevailed against 
joab and against the captains of the host and joab and the captains 
of the host went out from the presence of the king to number the 
people of israel 
and they passed over jordan and pitched in aroer on the right 
side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of gad and 
toward jazer then they came to gilead and to the land of 
tahtimhodshi and they came to danjaan and about to zidon and 
came to the strong hold of tyre and to all the cities of the hivites 
and of the canaanites and they went out to the south of judah even 
to beersheba 
so when they had gone through all the land they came to 
jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days 
and joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the 
king and there were in israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that 
drew the sword and the men of judah were five hundred thousand men 
and david s heart smote him after that he had numbered the 
people 
and david said unto the lord i have sinned greatly in that i have 
done and now i beseech thee o lord take away the iniquity of thy 
servant for i have done very foolishly 
for when david was up in the morning the word of the lord came 
unto the prophet gad david s seer saying go and say unto 
david thus saith the lord i offer thee three things choose thee one 
of them that i may do it unto thee 
so gad came to david and told him and said unto him shall 
seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land or wilt thou flee 
three months before thine enemies while they pursue thee or that 
there be three days pestilence in thy land now advise and see what 
answer i shall return to him that sent me 
and david said unto gad i am in a great strait let us fall now 
into the hand of the lord for his mercies are great and let me not 
fall into the hand of man 
so the lord sent a pestilence upon israel from the morning even 
to the time appointed and there died of the people from dan even to 
beersheba seventy thousand men 
and when the angel stretched out his hand upon jerusalem to 
destroy it the lord repented him of the evil and said to the angel 
that destroyed the people it is enough stay now thine hand and the 
angel of the lord was by the threshingplace of araunah the jebusite 
and david spake unto the lord when he saw the angel that smote 
the people and said lo i have sinned and i have done wickedly but 
these sheep what have they done let thine hand i pray thee be 
against me and against my father s house 
and gad came that day to david and said unto him go up rear 
an altar unto the lord in the threshingfloor of araunah the jebusite 
and david according to the saying of gad went up as the lord 
commanded 
and araunah looked and saw the king and his servants coming on 
toward him and araunah went out and bowed himself before the king on 
his face upon the ground 
and araunah said wherefore is my lord the king come to his 
servant and david said to buy the threshingfloor of thee to build 
an altar unto the lord that the plague may be stayed from the people 
and araunah said unto david let my lord the king take and offer 
up what seemeth good unto him behold here be oxen for burnt 
sacrifice and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen 
for wood 
all these things did araunah as a king give unto the king and 
araunah said unto the king the lord thy god accept thee 
and the king said unto araunah nay but i will surely buy it of 
thee at a price neither will i offer burnt offerings unto the lord my 
god of that which doth cost me nothing so david bought the 
threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver 
and david built there an altar unto the lord and offered burnt 
offerings and peace offerings so the lord was intreated for the land 
and the plague was stayed from israel 
the first book of the kings 
commonly called 
the third book of the kings 
now king david was old and stricken in years and they covered 
him with clothes but he gat no heat 
wherefore his servants said unto him let there be sought for my 
lord the king a young virgin and let her stand before the king and 
let her cherish him and let her lie in thy bosom that my lord the 
king may get heat 
so they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of 
israel and found abishag a shunammite and brought her to the king 
and the damsel was very fair and cherished the king and 
ministered to him but the king knew her not 
then adonijah the son of haggith exalted himself saying i will 
be king and he prepared him chariots and horsemen and fifty men to 
run before him 
and his father had not displeased him at any time in saying why 
hast thou done so and he also was a very goodly man and his mother 
bare him after absalom 
and he conferred with joab the son of zeruiah and with abiathar 
the priest and they following adonijah helped him 
but zadok the priest and benaiah the son of jehoiada and nathan 
the prophet and shimei and rei and the mighty men which belonged to 
david were not with adonijah 
and adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of 
zoheleth which is by enrogel and called all his brethren the king s 
sons and all the men of judah the king s servants but nathan 
the prophet and benaiah and the mighty men and solomon his brother 
he called not 
wherefore nathan spake unto bathsheba the mother of solomon 
saying hast thou not heard that adonijah the son of haggith doth 
reign and david our lord knoweth it not now therefore come 
let me i pray thee give thee counsel that thou mayest save thine 
own life and the life of thy son solomon 
go and get thee in unto king david and say unto him didst not 
thou my lord o king swear unto thine handmaid saying assuredly 
solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne 
why then doth adonijah reign behold while thou yet talkest 
there with the king i also will come in after thee and confirm thy 
words 
and bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber and the 
king was very old and abishag the shunammite ministered unto the 
king 
and bathsheba bowed and did obeisance unto the king and the 
king said what wouldest thou and she said unto him my lord 
thou swarest by the lord thy god unto thine handmaid saying 
assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon 
my throne 
and now behold adonijah reigneth and now my lord the king 
thou knowest it not and he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and 
sheep in abundance and hath called all the sons of the king and 
abiathar the priest and joab the captain of the host but solomon thy 
servant hath he not called 
and thou my lord o king the eyes of all israel are upon thee 
that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord 
the king after him 
otherwise it shall come to pass when my lord the king shall 
sleep with his fathers that i and my son solomon shall be counted 
offenders 
and lo while she yet talked with the king nathan the prophet 
also came in 
and they told the king saying behold nathan the prophet and 
when he was come in before the king he bowed himself before the king 
with his face to the ground 
and nathan said my lord o king hast thou said adonijah shall 
reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne for he is gone 
down this day and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in 
abundance and hath called all the king s sons and the captains of 
the host and abiathar the priest and behold they eat and drink 
before him and say god save king adonijah 
but me even me thy servant and zadok the priest and benaiah 
the son of jehoiada and thy servant solomon hath he not called 
is this thing done by my lord the king and thou hast not shewed 
it unto thy servant who should sit on the throne of my lord the king 
after him then king david answered and said call me bathsheba 
and she came into the king s presence and stood before the king 
and the king sware and said as the lord liveth that hath 
redeemed my soul out of all distress even as i sware unto thee 
by the lord god of israel saying assuredly solomon thy son shall 
reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead even so 
will i certainly do this day 
then bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth and did 
reverence to the king and said let my lord king david live for ever 
and king david said call me zadok the priest and nathan the 
prophet and benaiah the son of jehoiada and they came before the 
king 
the king also said unto them take with you the servants of your 
lord and because solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule and bring 
him down to gihon and let zadok the priest and nathan the 
prophet anoint him there king over israel and blow ye with the 
trumpet and say god save king solomon 
then ye shall come up after him that he may come and sit upon my 
throne for he shall be king in my stead and i have appointed him to 
be ruler over israel and over judah 
and benaiah the son of jehoiada answered the king and said 
amen the lord god of my lord the king say so too 
as the lord hath been with my lord the king even so be he with 
solomon and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king 
david 
so zadok the priest and nathan the prophet and benaiah the son 
of jehoiada and the cherethites and the pelethites went down and 
caused solomon to ride upon king david s mule and brought him to 
gihon 
and zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle 
and anointed solomon and they blew the trumpet and all the people 
said god save king solomon 
and all the people came up after him and the people piped with 
pipes and rejoiced with great joy so that the earth rent with the 
sound of them 
and adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as 
they had made an end of eating and when joab heard the sound of the 
trumpet he said wherefore is this noise of the city being in an 
uproar and while he yet spake behold jonathan the son of 
abiathar the priest came and adonijah said unto him come in for 
thou art a valiant man and bringest good tidings 
and jonathan answered and said to adonijah verily our lord king 
david hath made solomon king 
and the king hath sent with him zadok the priest and nathan the 
prophet and benaiah the son of jehoiada and the cherethites and the 
pelethites and they have caused him to ride upon the king s mule 
and zadok the priest and nathan the prophet have anointed him 
king in gihon and they are come up from thence rejoicing so that the 
city rang again this is the noise that ye have heard 
and also solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom 
and moreover the king s servants came to bless our lord king 
david saying god make the name of solomon better than thy name and 
make his throne greater than thy throne and the king bowed himself 
upon the bed 
and also thus said the king blessed be the lord god of israel 
which hath given one to sit on my throne this day mine eyes even 
seeing it 
and all the guests that were with adonijah were afraid and rose 
up and went every man his way 
and adonijah feared because of solomon and arose and went and 
caught hold on the horns of the altar 
and it was told solomon saying behold adonijah feareth king 
solomon for lo he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar 
saying let king solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his 
servant with the sword 
and solomon said if he will shew himself a worthy man there 
shall not an hair of him fall to the earth but if wickedness shall be 
found in him he shall die 
so king solomon sent and they brought him down from the altar 
and he came and bowed himself to king solomon and solomon said unto 
him go to thine house 
now the days of david drew nigh that he should die and he charged 
solomon his son saying i go the way of all the earth be thou 
strong therefore and shew thyself a man and keep the charge of 
the lord thy god to walk in his ways to keep his statutes and his 
commandments and his judgments and his testimonies as it is written 
in the law of moses that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest 
and whithersoever thou turnest thyself that the lord may continue 
his word which he spake concerning me saying if thy children take 
heed to their way to walk before me in truth with all their heart and 
with all their soul there shall not fail thee said he a man on the 
throne of israel 
moreover thou knowest also what joab the son of zeruiah did to me 
and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of israel unto abner 
the son of ner and unto amasa the son of jether whom he slew and 
she would the blood of war in peace and put the blood of war upon his 
girdle that was about his loins and in his shoes that were on his 
feet 
do therefore according to thy wisdom and let not his hoar head go 
down to the grave in peace 
but shew kindness unto the sons of barzillai the gileadite and 
let them be of those that eat at thy table for so they came to me 
when i fled because of absalom thy brother 
and behold thou hast with thee shimei the son of gera a 
benjamite of bahurim which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day 
when i went to mahanaim but he came down to meet me at jordan and i 
sware to him by the lord saying i will not put thee to death with 
the sword 
now therefore hold him not guiltless for thou art a wise man and 
knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him but his hoar head bring 
thou down to the grave with blood 
so david slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of 
david 
and the days that david reigned over israel were forty years 
seven years reigned he in hebron and thirty and three years reigned 
he in jerusalem 
then sat solomon upon the throne of david his father and his 
kingdom was established greatly 
and adonijah the son of haggith came to bathsheba the mother of 
solomon and she said comest thou peaceably and he said peaceably 
he said moreover i have somewhat to say unto thee and she said 
say on 
and he said thou knowest that the kingdom was mine and that all 
israel set their faces on me that i should reign howbeit the kingdom 
is turned about and is become my brother s for it was his from the 
lord 
and now i ask one petition of thee deny me not and she said 
unto him say on 
and he said speak i pray thee unto solomon the king for he 
will not say thee nay that he give me abishag the shunammite to 
wife 
and bathsheba said well i will speak for thee unto the king 
bathsheba therefore went unto king solomon to speak unto him for 
adonijah and the king rose up to meet her and bowed himself unto 
her and sat down on his throne and caused a seat to be set for the 
king s mother and she sat on his right hand 
then she said i desire one small petition of thee i pray thee 
say me not nay and the king said unto her ask on my mother for i 
will not say thee nay 
and she said let abishag the shunammite be given to adonijah thy 
brother to wife 
and king solomon answered and said unto his mother and why dost 
thou ask abishag the shunammite for adonijah ask for him the kingdom 
also for he is mine elder brother even for him and for abiathar the 
priest and for joab the son of zeruiah 
then king solomon sware by the lord saying god do so to me and 
more also if adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life 
now therefore as the lord liveth which hath established me and 
set me on the throne of david my father and who hath made me an 
house as he promised adonijah shall be put to death this day 
and king solomon sent by the hand of benaiah the son of jehoiada 
and he fell upon him that he died 
and unto abiathar the priest said the king get thee to anathoth 
unto thine own fields for thou art worthy of death but i will not at 
this time put thee to death because thou barest the ark of the lord 
god before david my father and because thou hast been afflicted in 
all wherein my father was afflicted 
so solomon thrust out abiathar from being priest unto the lord 
that he might fulfil the word of the lord which he spake concerning 
the house of eli in shiloh 
then tidings came to joab for joab had turned after adonijah 
though he turned not after absalom and joab fled unto the tabernacle 
of the lord and caught hold on the horns of the altar 
and it was told king solomon that joab was fled unto the 
tabernacle of the lord and behold he is by the altar then solomon 
sent benaiah the son of jehoiada saying go fall upon him 
and benaiah came to the tabernacle of the lord and said unto 
him thus saith the king come forth and he said nay but i will die 
here and benaiah brought the king word again saying thus said joab 
and thus he answered me 
and the king said unto him do as he hath said and fall upon 
him and bury him that thou mayest take away the innocent blood 
which joab she would from me and from the house of my father 
and the lord shall return his blood upon his own head who fell 
upon two men more righteous and better than he and slew them with the 
sword my father david not knowing thereof to wit abner the son of 
ner captain of the host of israel and amasa the son of jether 
captain of the host of judah 
their blood shall therefore return upon the head of joab and 
upon the head of his seed for ever but upon david and upon his seed 
and upon his house and upon his throne shall there be peace for ever 
from the lord 
so benaiah the son of jehoiada went up and fell upon him and 
slew him and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness 
and the king put benaiah the son of jehoiada in his room over the 
host and zadok the priest did the king put in the room of abiathar 
and the king sent and called for shimei and said unto him build 
thee an house in jerusalem and dwell there and go not forth thence 
any whither 
for it shall be that on the day thou goest out and passest over 
the brook kidron thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely 
die thy blood shall be upon thine own head 
and shimei said unto the king the saying is good as my lord the 
king hath said so will thy servant do and shimei dwelt in jerusalem 
many days 
and it came to pass at the end of three years that two of the 
servants of shimei ran away unto achish son of maachah king of gath 
and they told shimei saying behold thy servants be in gath 
and shimei arose and saddled his ass and went to gath to achish 
to seek his servants and shimei went and brought his servants from 
gath 
and it was told solomon that shimei had gone from jerusalem to 
gath and was come again 
and the king sent and called for shimei and said unto him did i 
not make thee to swear by the lord and protested unto thee saying 
know for a certain on the day thou goest out and walkest abroad any 
whither that thou shalt surely die and thou saidst unto me the word 
that i have heard is good 
why then hast thou not kept the oath of the lord and the 
commandment that i have charged thee with the king said 
moreover to shimei thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart 
is privy to that thou didst to david my father therefore the lord 
shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head and king solomon 
shall be blessed and the throne of david shall be established before 
the lord for ever 
so the king commanded benaiah the son of jehoiada which went 
out and fell upon him that he died and the kingdom was established 
in the hand of solomon 
and solomon made affinity with pharaoh king of egypt and took 
pharaoh s daughter and brought her into the city of david until he 
had made an end of building his own house and the house of the lord 
and the wall of jerusalem round about 
only the people sacrificed in high places because there was no 
house built unto the name of the lord until those days 
and solomon loved the lord walking in the statutes of david his 
father only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places 
and the king went to gibeon to sacrifice there for that was the 
great high place a thousand burnt offerings did solomon offer upon 
that altar 
in gibeon the lord appeared to solomon in a dream by night and 
god said ask what i shall give thee 
and solomon said thou hast shewed unto thy servant david my 
father great mercy according as he walked before thee in truth and 
in righteousness and in uprightness of heart with thee and thou hast 
kept for him this great kindness that thou hast given him a son to 
sit on his throne as it is this day 
and now o lord my god thou hast made thy servant king instead of 
david my father and i am but a little child i know not how to go out 
or come in 
and thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast 
chosen a great people that cannot be numbered nor counted for 
multitude 
give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy 
people that i may discern between good and bad for who is able to 
judge this thy so great a people and the speech pleased the 
lord that solomon had asked this thing 
and god said unto him because thou hast asked this thing and 
hast not asked for thyself long life neither hast asked riches for 
thyself nor hast asked the life of thine enemies but hast asked for 
thyself understanding to discern judgment behold i have done 
according to thy words lo i have given thee a wise and an 
understanding heart so that there was none like thee before thee 
neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee 
and i have also given thee that which thou hast not asked both 
riches and honour so that there shall not be any among the kings 
like unto thee all thy days 
and if thou wilt walk in my ways to keep my statutes and my 
commandments as thy father david did walk then i will lengthen thy 
days 
and solomon awoke and behold it was a dream and he came to 
jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of the lord and 
offered up burnt offerings and offered peace offerings and made a 
feast to all his servants 
then came there two women that were harlots unto the king and 
stood before him 
and the one woman said o my lord i and this woman dwell in one 
house and i was delivered of a child with her in the house 
and it came to pass the third day after that i was delivered 
that this woman was delivered also and we were together there was no 
stranger with us in the house save we two in the house 
and this woman s child died in the night because she overlaid 
it 
and she arose at midnight and took my son from beside me while 
thine handmaid slept and laid it in her bosom and laid her dead 
child in my bosom 
and when i rose in the morning to give my child suck behold it 
was dead but when i had considered it in the morning behold it was 
not my son which i did bear 
and the other woman said nay but the living is my son and the 
dead is thy son and this said no but the dead is thy son and the 
living is my son thus they spake before the king 
then said the king the one saith this is my son that liveth 
and thy son is the dead and the other saith nay but thy son is the 
dead and my son is the living 
and the king said bring me a sword and they brought a sword 
before the king 
and the king said divide the living child in two and give half 
to the one and half to the other 
then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king 
for her bowels yearned upon her son and she said o my lord give her 
the living child and in no wise slay it but the other said let it 
be neither mine nor thine but divide it 
then the king answered and said give her the living child and 
in no wise slay it she is the mother thereof 
and all israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged 
and they feared the king for they saw that the wisdom of god was in 
him to do judgment 
so king solomon was king over all israel 
and these were the princes which he had azariah the son of zadok 
the priest elihoreph and ahiah the sons of shisha scribes 
jehoshaphat the son of ahilud the recorder 
and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over the host and zadok and 
abiathar were the priests and azariah the son of nathan was over 
the officers and zabud the son of nathan was principal officer and 
the king s friend and ahishar was over the household and 
adoniram the son of abda was over the tribute 
and solomon had twelve officers over all israel which provided 
victuals for the king and his household each man his month in a year 
made provision 
and these are their names the son of hur in mount ephraim 
the son of dekar in makaz and in shaalbim and bethshemesh and 
elonbethhanan the son of hesed in aruboth to him pertained 
sochoh and all the land of hepher the son of abinadab in all 
the region of dor which had taphath the daughter of solomon to wife 
baana the son of ahilud to him pertained taanach and megiddo 
and all bethshean which is by zartanah beneath jezreel from 
bethshean to abelmeholah even unto the place that is beyond jokneam 
the son of geber in ramothgilead to him pertained the towns of 
jair the son of manasseh which are in gilead to him also pertained 
the region of argob which is in bashan threescore great cities with 
walls and brasen bars ahinadab the son of iddo had mahanaim 
ahimaaz was in naphtali he also took basmath the daughter of 
solomon to wife baanah the son of hushai was in asher and in 
aloth jehoshaphat the son of paruah in issachar shimei 
the son of elah in benjamin geber the son of uri was in the 
country of gilead in the country of sihon king of the amorites and 
of og king of bashan and he was the only officer which was in the 
land 
judah and israel were many as the sand which is by the sea in 
multitude eating and drinking and making merry 
and solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the 
land of the philistines and unto the border of egypt they brought 
presents and served solomon all the days of his life 
and solomon s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine 
flour and threescore measures of meal ten fat oxen and twenty 
oxen out of the pastures and an hundred sheep beside harts and 
roebucks and fallowdeer and fatted fowl 
for he had dominion over all the region on this side the river 
from tiphsah even to azzah over all the kings on this side the river 
and he had peace on all sides round about him 
and judah and israel dwelt safely every man under his vine and 
under his fig tree from dan even to beersheba all the days of 
solomon 
and solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots 
and twelve thousand horsemen 
and those officers provided victual for king solomon and for all 
that came unto king solomon s table every man in his month they 
lacked nothing 
barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they 
unto the place where the officers were every man according to his 
charge 
and god gave solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much and 
largeness of heart even as the sand that is on the sea shore 
and solomon s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of 
the east country and all the wisdom of egypt 
for he was wiser than all men than ethan the ezrahite and 
heman and chalcol and darda the sons of mahol and his fame was in 
all nations round about 
and he spake three thousand proverbs and his songs were a 
thousand and five 
and he spake of trees from the cedar tree that is in lebanon 
even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall he spake also of 
beasts and of fowl and of creeping things and of fishes 
and there came of all people to hear the wisdom of solomon from 
all kings of the earth which had heard of his wisdom 
and hiram king of tyre sent his servants unto solomon for he had 
heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father for 
hiram was ever a lover of david 
and solomon sent to hiram saying thou knowest how that david 
my father could not build an house unto the name of the lord his god 
for the wars which were about him on every side until the lord put 
them under the soles of his feet 
but now the lord my god hath given me rest on every side so that 
there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent 
and behold i purpose to build an house unto the name of the lord 
my god as the lord spake unto david my father saying thy son whom 
i will set upon thy throne in thy room he shall build an house unto 
my name 
now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of 
lebanon and my servants shall be with thy servants and unto thee 
will i give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt 
appoint for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can 
skill to hew timber like unto the sidonians 
and it came to pass when hiram heard the words of solomon that 
he rejoiced greatly and said blessed be the lord this day which 
hath given unto david a wise son over this great people 
and hiram sent to solomon saying i have considered the things 
which thou sentest to me for and i will do all thy desire concerning 
timber of cedar and concerning timber of fir 
my servants shall bring them down from lebanon unto the sea and i 
will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt 
appoint me and will cause them to be discharged there and thou shalt 
receive them and thou shalt accomplish my desire in giving food for 
my household 
so hiram gave solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all 
his desire 
and solomon gave hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food 
to his household and twenty measures of pure oil thus gave solomon 
to hiram year by year 
and the lord gave solomon wisdom as he promised him and there 
was peace between hiram and solomon and they two made a league 
together 
and king solomon raised a levy out of all israel and the levy 
was thirty thousand men 
and he sent them to lebanon ten thousand a month by courses a 
month they were in lebanon and two months at home and adoniram was 
over the levy 
and solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens 
and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains beside the chief 
of solomon s officers which were over the work three thousand and 
three hundred which ruled over the people that wrought in the work 
and the king commanded and they brought great stones costly 
stones and hewed stones to lay the foundation of the house 
and solomon s builders and hiram s builders did hew them and the 
stonesquarers so they prepared timber and stones to build the house 
and it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after 
the children of israel were come out of the land of egypt in the 
fourth year of solomon s reign over israel in the month zif which is 
the second month that he began to build the house of the lord 
and the house which king solomon built for the lord the length 
thereof was threescore cubits and the breadth thereof twenty cubits 
and the height thereof thirty cubits 
and the porch before the temple of the house twenty cubits was 
the length thereof according to the breadth of the house and ten 
cubits was the breadth thereof before the house 
and for the house he made windows of narrow lights 
and against the wall of the house he built chambers round about 
against the walls of the house round about both of the temple and of 
the oracle and he made chambers round about the nethermost 
chamber was five cubits broad and the middle was six cubits broad 
and the third was seven cubits broad for without in the wall of the 
house he made narrowed rests round about that the beams should not be 
fastened in the walls of the house 
and the house when it was in building was built of stone made 
ready before it was brought thither so that there was neither hammer 
nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house while it was in 
building 
the door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the 
house and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber 
and out of the middle into the third 
so he built the house and finished it and covered the house with 
beams and boards of cedar 
and then he built chambers against all the house five cubits 
high and they rested on the house with timber of cedar 
and the word of the lord came to solomon saying concerning 
this house which thou art in building if thou wilt walk in my 
statutes and execute my judgments and keep all my commandments to 
walk in them then will i perform my word with thee which i spake 
unto david thy father and i will dwell among the children of 
israel and will not forsake my people israel 
so solomon built the house and finished it 
and he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar 
both the floor of the house and the walls of the ceiling and he 
covered them on the inside with wood and covered the floor of the 
house with planks of fir 
and he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house both the 
floor and the walls with boards of cedar he even built them for it 
within even for the oracle even for the most holy place 
and the house that is the temple before it was forty cubits 
long 
and the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open 
flowers all was cedar there was no stone seen 
and the oracle he prepared in the house within to set there the 
ark of the covenant of the lord 
and the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length and 
twenty cubits in breadth and twenty cubits in the height thereof and 
he overlaid it with pure gold and so covered the altar which was of 
cedar 
so solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold and he made 
a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle and he overlaid 
it with gold 
and the whole house he overlaid with gold until he had finished 
all the house also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid 
with gold 
and within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree each 
ten cubits high 
and five cubits was the one wing of the cherub and five cubits 
the other wing of the cherub from the uttermost part of the one wing 
unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits 
and the other cherub was ten cubits both the cherubims were of 
one measure and one size 
the height of the one cherub was ten cubits and so was it of the 
other cherub 
and he set the cherubims within the inner house and they 
stretched forth the wings of the cherubims so that the wing of the 
one touched the one wall and the wing of the other cherub touched the 
other wall and their wings touched one another in the midst of the 
house 
and he overlaid the cherubims with gold 
and he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved 
figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers within and 
without 
and the floors of the house he overlaid with gold within and 
without 
and for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree 
the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall 
the two doors also were of olive tree and he carved upon them 
carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers and overlaid 
them with gold and spread gold upon the cherubims and upon the palm 
trees 
so also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree a 
fourth part of the wall 
and the two doors were of fir tree the two leaves of the one 
door were folding and the two leaves of the other door were folding 
and he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers 
and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work 
and he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone and 
a row of cedar beams 
in the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the lord 
laid in the month zif and in the eleventh year in the month 
bul which is the eighth month was the house finished throughout all 
the parts thereof and according to all the fashion of it so was he 
seven years in building it 
but solomon was building his own house thirteen years and he 
finished all his house 
he built also the house of the forest of lebanon the length 
thereof was an hundred cubits and the breadth thereof fifty cubits 
and the height thereof thirty cubits upon four rows of cedar pillars 
with cedar beams upon the pillars 
and it was covered with cedar above upon the beams that lay on 
forty five pillars fifteen in a row 
and there were windows in three rows and light was against light 
in three ranks 
and all the doors and posts were square with the windows and 
light was against light in three ranks 
and he made a porch of pillars the length thereof was fifty 
cubits and the breadth thereof thirty cubits and the porch was 
before them and the other pillars and the thick beam were before 
them 
then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge even the 
porch of judgment and it was covered with cedar from one side of the 
floor to the other 
and his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch 
which was of the like work solomon made also an house for pharaoh s 
daughter whom he had taken to wife like unto this porch 
all these were of costly stones according to the measures of 
hewed stones sawed with saws within and without even from the 
foundation unto the coping and so on the outside toward the great 
court 
and the foundation was of costly stones even great stones 
stones of ten cubits and stones of eight cubits 
and above were costly stones after the measures of hewed stones 
and cedars 
and the great court round about was with three rows of hewed 
stones and a row of cedar beams both for the inner court of the 
house of the lord and for the porch of the house 
and king solomon sent and fetched hiram out of tyre 
he was a widow s son of the tribe of naphtali and his father was 
a man of tyre a worker in brass and he was filled with wisdom and 
understanding and cunning to work all works in brass and he came to 
king solomon and wrought all his work 
for he cast two pillars of brass of eighteen cubits high apiece 
and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about 
and he made two chapiters of molten brass to set upon the tops 
of the pillars the height of the one chapiter was five cubits and 
the height of the other chapiter was five cubits and nets of 
checker work and wreaths of chain work for the chapiters which were 
upon the top of the pillars seven for the one chapiter and seven for 
the other chapiter 
and he made the pillars and two rows round about upon the one 
network to cover the chapiters that were upon the top with 
pomegranates and so did he for the other chapiter 
and the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of 
lily work in the porch four cubits 
and the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also 
above over against the belly which was by the network and the 
pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other 
chapiter 
and he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple and he set 
up the right pillar and called the name thereof jachin and he set up 
the left pillar and called the name thereof boaz 
and upon the top of the pillars was lily work so was the work of 
the pillars finished 
and he made a molten sea ten cubits from the one brim to the 
other it was round all about and his height was five cubits and a 
line of thirty cubits did compass it round about 
and under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing 
it ten in a cubit compassing the sea round about the knops were 
cast in two rows when it was cast 
it stood upon twelve oxen three looking toward the north and 
three looking toward the west and three looking toward the south and 
three looking toward the east and the sea was set above upon them 
and all their hinder parts were inward 
and it was an hand breadth thick and the brim thereof was 
wrought like the brim of a cup with flowers of lilies it contained 
two thousand baths 
and he made ten bases of brass four cubits was the length of one 
base and four cubits the breadth thereof and three cubits the height 
of it 
and the work of the bases was on this manner they had borders 
and the borders were between the ledges and on the borders that 
were between the ledges were lions oxen and cherubims and upon the 
ledges there was a base above and beneath the lions and oxen were 
certain additions made of thin work 
and every base had four brasen wheels and plates of brass and 
the four corners thereof had undersetters under the laver were 
undersetters molten at the side of every addition 
and the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit 
but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base a cubit 
and an half and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their 
borders foursquare not round 
and under the borders were four wheels and the axletrees of the 
wheels were joined to the base and the height of a wheel was a cubit 
and half a cubit 
and the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel 
their axletrees and their naves and their felloes and their spokes 
were all molten 
and there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base 
and the undersetters were of the very base itself 
and in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a 
cubit high and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the 
borders thereof were of the same 
for on the plates of the ledges thereof and on the borders 
thereof he graved cherubims lions and palm trees according to the 
proportion of every one and additions round about 
after this manner he made the ten bases all of them had one 
casting one measure and one size 
then made he ten lavers of brass one laver contained forty 
baths and every laver was four cubits and upon every one of the ten 
bases one laver 
and he put five bases on the right side of the house and five on 
the left side of the house and he set the sea on the right side of 
the house eastward over against the south 
and hiram made the lavers and the shovels and the basons so 
hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king solomon for 
the house of the lord the two pillars and the two bowls of the 
chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars and the two 
networks to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the 
top of the pillars and four hundred pomegranates for the two 
networks even two rows of pomegranates for one network to cover the 
two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars and the 
ten bases and ten lavers on the bases and one sea and twelve 
oxen under the sea and the pots and the shovels and the 
basons and all these vessels which hiram made to king solomon for 
the house of the lord were of bright brass 
in the plain of jordan did the king cast them in the clay ground 
between succoth and zarthan 
and solomon left all the vessels unweighed because they were 
exceeding many neither was the weight of the brass found out 
and solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of 
the lord the altar of gold and the table of gold whereupon the 
shewbread was and the candlesticks of pure gold five on the 
right side and five on the left before the oracle with the flowers 
and the lamps and the tongs of gold and the bowls and the 
snuffers and the basons and the spoons and the censers of pure 
gold and the hinges of gold both for the doors of the inner house 
the most holy place and for the doors of the house to wit of the 
temple 
so was ended all the work that king solomon made for the house of 
the lord and solomon brought in the things which david his father had 
dedicated even the silver and the gold and the vessels did he put 
among the treasures of the house of the lord 
then solomon assembled the elders of israel and all the heads of 
the tribes the chief of the fathers of the children of israel unto 
king solomon in jerusalem that they might bring up the ark of the 
covenant of the lord out of the city of david which is zion 
and all the men of israel assembled themselves unto king solomon 
at the feast in the month ethanim which is the seventh month 
and all the elders of israel came and the priests took up the 
ark 
and they brought up the ark of the lord and the tabernacle of the 
congregation and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle 
even those did the priests and the levites bring up 
and king solomon and all the congregation of israel that were 
assembled unto him were with him before the ark sacrificing sheep 
and oxen that could not be told nor numbered for multitude 
and the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the lord 
unto his place into the oracle of the house to the most holy place 
even under the wings of the cherubims 
for the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of 
the ark and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof 
above 
and they drew out the staves that the ends of the staves were 
seen out in the holy place before the oracle and they were not seen 
without and there they are unto this day 
there was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which 
moses put there at horeb when the lord made a covenant with the 
children of israel when they came out of the land of egypt 
and it came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy 
place that the cloud filled the house of the lord so that the 
priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud for the 
glory of the lord had filled the house of the lord 
then spake solomon the lord said that he would dwell in the 
thick darkness 
i have surely built thee an house to dwell in a settled place 
for thee to abide in for ever 
and the king turned his face about and blessed all the 
congregation of israel and all the congregation of israel stood 
and he said blessed be the lord god of israel which spake with 
his mouth unto david my father and hath with his hand fulfilled it 
saying since the day that i brought forth my people israel out 
of egypt i chose no city out of all the tribes of israel to build an 
house that my name might be therein but i chose david to be over my 
people israel 
and it was in the heart of david my father to build an house for 
the name of the lord god of israel 
and the lord said unto david my father whereas it was in thine 
heart to build an house unto my name thou didst well that it was in 
thine heart 
nevertheless thou shalt not build the house but thy son that 
shall come forth out of thy loins he shall build the house unto my 
name 
and the lord hath performed his word that he spake and i am 
risen up in the room of david my father and sit on the throne of 
israel as the lord promised and have built an house for the name of 
the lord god of israel 
and i have set there a place for the ark wherein is the covenant 
of the lord which he made with our fathers when he brought them out 
of the land of egypt 
and solomon stood before the altar of the lord in the presence of 
all the congregation of israel and spread forth his hands toward 
heaven and he said lord god of israel there is no god like 
thee in heaven above or on earth beneath who keepest covenant and 
mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart 
who hast kept with thy servant david my father that thou 
promisedst him thou spakest also with thy mouth and hast fulfilled 
it with thine hand as it is this day 
therefore now lord god of israel keep with thy servant david my 
father that thou promisedst him saying there shall not fail thee a 
man in my sight to sit on the throne of israel so that thy children 
take heed to their way that they walk before me as thou hast walked 
before me 
and now o god of israel let thy word i pray thee be verified 
which thou spakest unto thy servant david my father 
but will god indeed dwell on the earth behold the heaven and 
heaven of heavens cannot contain thee how much less this house that i 
have builded yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy 
servant and to his supplication o lord my god to hearken unto the 
cry and to the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee to day 
that thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day even 
toward the place of which thou hast said my name shall be there that 
thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make 
toward this place 
and hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant and of thy 
people israel when they shall pray toward this place and hear thou 
in heaven thy dwelling place and when thou hearest forgive 
if any man trespass against his neighbour and an oath be laid 
upon him to cause him to swear and the oath come before thine altar 
in this house then hear thou in heaven and do and judge thy 
servants condemning the wicked to bring his way upon his head and 
justifying the righteous to give him according to his righteousness 
when thy people israel be smitten down before the enemy because 
they have sinned against thee and shall turn again to thee and 
confess thy name and pray and make supplication unto thee in this 
house then hear thou in heaven and forgive the sin of thy 
people israel and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest 
unto their fathers 
when heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they have 
sinned against thee if they pray toward this place and confess thy 
name and turn from their sin when thou afflictest them then 
hear thou in heaven and forgive the sin of thy servants and of thy 
people israel that thou teach them the good way wherein they should 
walk and give rain upon thy land which thou hast given to thy people 
for an inheritance 
if there be in the land famine if there be pestilence blasting 
mildew locust or if there be caterpiller if their enemy besiege 
them in the land of their cities whatsoever plague whatsoever 
sickness there be what prayer and supplication soever be made by 
any man or by all thy people israel which shall know every man the 
plague of his own heart and spread forth his hands toward this house 
then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place and forgive and do 
and give to every man according to his ways whose heart thou knowest 
for thou even thou only knowest the hearts of all the children of 
men that they may fear thee all the days that they live in the 
land which thou gavest unto our fathers 
moreover concerning a stranger that is not of thy people israel 
but cometh out of a far country for thy name s sake for they 
shall hear of thy great name and of thy strong hand and of thy 
stretched out arm when he shall come and pray toward this house 
hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place and do according to all 
that the stranger calleth to thee for that all people of the earth 
may know thy name to fear thee as do thy people israel and that 
they may know that this house which i have builded is called by thy 
name 
if thy people go out to battle against their enemy whithersoever 
thou shalt send them and shall pray unto the lord toward the city 
which thou hast chosen and toward the house that i have built for thy 
name then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their 
supplication and maintain their because 
if they sin against thee for there is no man that sinneth not 
and thou be angry with them and deliver them to the enemy so that 
they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy far or near 
yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they 
were carried captives and repent and make supplication unto thee in 
the land of them that carried them captives saying we have sinned 
and have done perversely we have committed wickedness and so 
return unto thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the 
land of their enemies which led them away captive and pray unto thee 
toward their land which thou gavest unto their fathers the city 
which thou hast chosen and the house which i have built for thy name 
then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy 
dwelling place and maintain their because and forgive thy people 
that have sinned against thee and all their transgressions wherein 
they have transgressed against thee and give them compassion before 
them who carried them captive that they may have compassion on them 
for they be thy people and thine inheritance which thou 
broughtest forth out of egypt from the midst of the furnace of iron 
that thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant 
and unto the supplication of thy people israel to hearken unto them 
in all that they call for unto thee 
for thou didst separate them from among all the people of the 
earth to be thine inheritance as thou spakest by the hand of moses 
thy servant when thou broughtest our fathers out of egypt o lord 
god 
and it was so that when solomon had made an end of praying all 
this prayer and supplication unto the lord he arose from before the 
altar of the lord from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up 
to heaven 
and he stood and blessed all the congregation of israel with a 
loud voice saying blessed be the lord that hath given rest 
unto his people israel according to all that he promised there hath 
not failed one word of all his good promise which he promised by the 
hand of moses his servant 
the lord our god be with us as he was with our fathers let him 
not leave us nor forsake us that he may incline our hearts unto 
him to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments and his 
statutes and his judgments which he commanded our fathers 
and let these my words wherewith i have made supplication before 
the lord be nigh unto the lord our god day and night that he 
maintain the because of his servant and the because of his people israel 
at all times as the matter shall require that all the people of 
the earth may know that the lord is god and that there is none else 
let your heart therefore be perfect with the lord our god to 
walk in his statutes and to keep his commandments as at this day 
and the king and all israel with him offered sacrifice before 
the lord 
and solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings which he 
offered unto the lord two and twenty thousand oxen and an hundred 
and twenty thousand sheep so the king and all the children of israel 
dedicated the house of the lord 
the same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was 
before the house of the lord for there he offered burnt offerings 
and meat offerings and the fat of the peace offerings because the 
brasen altar that was before the lord was too little to receive the 
burnt offerings and meat offerings and the fat of the peace 
offerings 
and at that time solomon held a feast and all israel with him a 
great congregation from the entering in of hamath unto the river of 
egypt before the lord our god seven days and seven days even 
fourteen days 
on the eighth day he sent the people away and they blessed the 
king and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the 
goodness that the lord had done for david his servant and for israel 
his people 
and it came to pass when solomon had finished the building of the 
house of the lord and the king s house and all solomon s desire 
which he was pleased to do that the lord appeared to solomon the 
second time as he had appeared unto him at gibeon 
and the lord said unto him i have heard thy prayer and thy 
supplication that thou hast made before me i have hallowed this 
house which thou hast built to put my name there for ever and mine 
eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually 
and if thou wilt walk before me as david thy father walked in 
integrity of heart and in uprightness to do according to all that i 
have commanded thee and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments 
then i will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon israel for ever 
as i promised to david thy father saying there shall not fail thee a 
man upon the throne of israel 
but if ye shall at all turn from following me ye or your 
children and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which i 
have set before you but go and serve other gods and worship them 
then will i cut off israel out of the land which i have given 
them and this house which i have hallowed for my name will i cast 
out of my sight and israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all 
people and at this house which is high every one that passeth 
by it shall be astonished and shall hiss and they shall say why 
hath the lord done thus unto this land and to this house and 
they shall answer because they forsook the lord their god who 
brought forth their fathers out of the land of egypt and have taken 
hold upon other gods and have worshipped them and served them 
therefore hath the lord brought upon them all this evil 
and it came to pass at the end of twenty years when solomon had 
built the two houses the house of the lord and the king s house 
now hiram the king of tyre had furnished solomon with cedar 
trees and fir trees and with gold according to all his desire that 
then king solomon gave hiram twenty cities in the land of galilee 
and hiram came out from tyre to see the cities which solomon had 
given him and they pleased him not 
and he said what cities are these which thou hast given me my 
brother and he called them the land of cabul unto this day 
and hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold 
and this is the reason of the levy which king solomon raised for 
to build the house of the lord and his own house and millo and the 
wall of jerusalem and hazor and megiddo and gezer 
for pharaoh king of egypt had gone up and taken gezer and burnt 
it with fire and slain the canaanites that dwelt in the city and 
given it for a present unto his daughter solomon s wife 
and solomon built gezer and bethhoron the nether and 
baalath and tadmor in the wilderness in the land and all the 
cities of store that solomon had and cities for his chariots and 
cities for his horsemen and that which solomon desired to build in 
jerusalem and in lebanon and in all the land of his dominion 
and all the people that were left of the amorites hittites 
perizzites hivites and jebusites which were not of the children of 
israel their children that were left after them in the land 
whom the children of israel also were not able utterly to destroy 
upon those did solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day 
but of the children of israel did solomon make no bondmen but 
they were men of war and his servants and his princes and his 
captains and rulers of his chariots and his horsemen 
these were the chief of the officers that were over solomon s 
work five hundred and fifty which bare rule over the people that 
wrought in the work 
but pharaoh s daughter came up out of the city of david unto her 
house which solomon had built for her then did he build millo 
and three times in a year did solomon offer burnt offerings and 
peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the lord and he 
burnt incense upon the altar that was before the lord so he finished 
the house 
and king solomon made a navy of ships in eziongeber which is 
beside eloth on the shore of the red sea in the land of edom 
and hiram sent in the navy his servants shipmen that had 
knowledge of the sea with the servants of solomon 
and they came to ophir and fetched from thence gold four 
hundred and twenty talents and brought it to king solomon 
and when the queen of sheba heard of the fame of solomon 
concerning the name of the lord she came to prove him with hard 
questions 
and she came to jerusalem with a very great train with camels 
that bare spices and very much gold and precious stones and when 
she was come to solomon she communed with him of all that was in her 
heart 
and solomon told her all her questions there was not any thing 
hid from the king which he told her not 
and when the queen of sheba had seen all solomon s wisdom and 
the house that he had built and the meat of his table and the 
sitting of his servants and the attendance of his ministers and 
their apparel and his cupbearers and his ascent by which he went up 
unto the house of the lord there was no more spirit in her 
and she said to the king it was a true report that i heard in 
mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom 
howbeit i believed not the words until i came and mine eyes had 
seen it and behold the half was not told me thy wisdom and 
prosperity exceedeth the fame which i heard 
happy are thy men happy are these thy servants which stand 
continually before thee and that hear thy wisdom 
blessed be the lord thy god which delighted in thee to set thee 
on the throne of israel because the lord loved israel for ever 
therefore made he thee king to do judgment and justice 
and she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold and 
of spices very great store and precious stones there came no more 
such abundance of spices as these which the queen of sheba gave to 
king solomon 
and the navy also of hiram that brought gold from ophir 
brought in from ophir great plenty of almug trees and precious 
stones 
and the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of 
the lord and for the king s house harps also and psalteries for 
singers there came no such almug trees nor were seen unto this day 
and king solomon gave unto the queen of sheba all her desire 
whatsoever she asked beside that which solomon gave her of his royal 
bounty 
so she turned and went to her own country she and her servants 
now the weight of gold that came to solomon in one year was six 
hundred threescore and six talents of gold beside that he had 
of the merchantmen and of the traffick of the spice merchants and of 
all the kings of arabia and of the governors of the country 
and king solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold six 
hundred shekels of gold went to one target 
and he made three hundred shields of beaten gold three pound of 
gold went to one shield and the king put them in the house of the 
forest of lebanon 
moreover the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it 
with the best gold 
the throne had six steps and the top of the throne was round 
behind and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat 
and two lions stood beside the stays 
and twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other 
upon the six steps there was not the like made in any kingdom 
and all king solomon s drinking vessels were of gold and all 
the vessels of the house of the forest of lebanon were of pure gold 
none were of silver it was nothing accounted of in the days of 
solomon 
for the king had at sea a navy of tharshish with the navy of 
hiram once in three years came the navy of tharshish bringing gold 
and silver ivory and apes and peacocks 
so king solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches 
and for wisdom 
and all the earth sought to solomon to hear his wisdom which 
god had put in his heart 
and they brought every man his present vessels of silver and 
vessels of gold and garments and armour and spices horses and 
mules a rate year by year 
and solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen and he had 
a thousand and four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen 
whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots and with the king at 
jerusalem 
and the king made silver to be in jerusalem as stones and 
cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale for 
abundance 
and solomon had horses brought out of egypt and linen yarn the 
king s merchants received the linen yarn at a price 
and a chariot came up and went out of egypt for six hundred 
shekels of silver and an horse for an hundred and fifty and so for 
all the kings of the hittites and for the kings of syria did they 
bring them out by their means 
but king solomon loved many strange women together with the 
daughter of pharaoh women of the moabites ammonites edomites 
zidonians and hittites of the nations concerning which the lord 
said unto the children of israel ye shall not go in to them neither 
shall they come in unto you for surely they will turn away your heart 
after their gods solomon clave unto these in love 
and he had seven hundred wives princesses and three hundred 
concubines and his wives turned away his heart 
for it came to pass when solomon was old that his wives turned 
away his heart after other gods and his heart was not perfect with 
the lord his god as was the heart of david his father 
for solomon went after ashtoreth the goddess of the zidonians 
and after milcom the abomination of the ammonites 
and solomon did evil in the sight of the lord and went not fully 
after the lord as did david his father 
then did solomon build an high place for chemosh the abomination 
of moab in the hill that is before jerusalem and for molech the 
abomination of the children of ammon 
and likewise did he for all his strange wives which burnt 
incense and sacrificed unto their gods 
and the lord was angry with solomon because his heart was turned 
from the lord god of israel which had appeared unto him twice 
and had commanded him concerning this thing that he should not go 
after other gods but he kept not that which the lord commanded 
wherefore the lord said unto solomon forasmuch as this is done 
of thee and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes which i 
have commanded thee i will surely rend the kingdom from thee and 
will give it to thy servant 
notwithstanding in thy days i will not do it for david thy 
father s sake but i will rend it out of the hand of thy son 
howbeit i will not rend away all the kingdom but will give one 
tribe to thy son for david my servant s sake and for jerusalem s sake 
which i have chosen 
and the lord stirred up an adversary unto solomon hadad the 
edomite he was of the king s seed in edom 
for it came to pass when david was in edom and joab the 
captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain after he had 
smitten every male in edom for six months did joab remain 
there with all israel until he had cut off every male in edom 
that hadad fled he and certain edomites of his father s servants with 
him to go into egypt hadad being yet a little child 
and they arose out of midian and came to paran and they took 
men with them out of paran and they came to egypt unto pharaoh king 
of egypt which gave him an house and appointed him victuals and 
gave him land 
and hadad found great favour in the sight of pharaoh so that he 
gave him to wife the sister of his own wife the sister of tahpenes 
the queen 
and the sister of tahpenes bare him genubath his son whom 
tahpenes weaned in pharaoh s house and genubath was in pharaoh s 
household among the sons of pharaoh 
and when hadad heard in egypt that david slept with his fathers 
and that joab the captain of the host was dead hadad said to pharaoh 
let me depart that i may go to mine own country 
then pharaoh said unto him but what hast thou lacked with me 
that behold thou seekest to go to thine own country and he 
answered nothing howbeit let me go in any wise 
and god stirred him up another adversary rezon the son of 
eliadah which fled from his lord hadadezer king of zobah and 
he gathered men unto him and became captain over a band when david 
slew them of zobah and they went to damascus and dwelt therein and 
reigned in damascus 
and he was an adversary to israel all the days of solomon 
beside the mischief that hadad did and he abhorred israel and 
reigned over syria 
and jeroboam the son of nebat an ephrathite of zereda 
solomon s servant whose mother s name was zeruah a widow woman even 
he lifted up his hand against the king 
and this was the because that he lifted up his hand against the 
king solomon built millo and repaired the breaches of the city of 
david his father 
and the man jeroboam was a mighty man of valour and solomon 
seeing the young man that he was industrious he made him ruler over 
all the charge of the house of joseph 
and it came to pass at that time when jeroboam went out of 
jerusalem that the prophet ahijah the shilonite found him in the way 
and he had clad himself with a new garment and they two were alone in 
the field and ahijah caught the new garment that was on him 
and rent it in twelve pieces and he said to jeroboam take thee 
ten pieces for thus saith the lord the god of israel behold i will 
rend the kingdom out of the hand of solomon and will give ten tribes 
to thee but he shall have one tribe for my servant david s 
sake and for jerusalem s sake the city which i have chosen out of 
all the tribes of israel because that they have forsaken me 
and have worshipped ashtoreth the goddess of the zidonians chemosh 
the god of the moabites and milcom the god of the children of ammon 
and have not walked in my ways to do that which is right in mine 
eyes and to keep my statutes and my judgments as did david his 
father 
howbeit i will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand but i 
will make him prince all the days of his life for david my servant s 
sake whom i chose because he kept my commandments and my statutes 
but i will take the kingdom out of his son s hand and will give 
it unto thee even ten tribes 
and unto his son will i give one tribe that david my servant 
may have a light alway before me in jerusalem the city which i have 
chosen me to put my name there 
and i will take thee and thou shalt reign according to all that 
thy soul desireth and shalt be king over israel 
and it shall be if thou wilt hearken unto all that i command 
thee and wilt walk in my ways and do that is right in my sight to 
keep my statutes and my commandments as david my servant did that i 
will be with thee and build thee a sure house as i built for david 
and will give israel unto thee 
and i will for this afflict the seed of david but not for ever 
solomon sought therefore to kill jeroboam and jeroboam arose 
and fled into egypt unto shishak king of egypt and was in egypt 
until the death of solomon 
and the rest of the acts of solomon and all that he did and 
his wisdom are they not written in the book of the acts of solomon 
and the time that solomon reigned in jerusalem over all israel 
was forty years 
and solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the city 
of david his father and rehoboam his son reigned in his stead 
and rehoboam went to shechem for all israel were come to shechem 
to make him king 
and it came to pass when jeroboam the son of nebat who was yet 
in egypt heard of it for he was fled from the presence of king 
solomon and jeroboam dwelt in egypt that they sent and called 
him and jeroboam and all the congregation of israel came and spake 
unto rehoboam saying thy father made our yoke grievous now 
therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father and his heavy 
yoke which he put upon us lighter and we will serve thee 
and he said unto them depart yet for three days then come again 
to me and the people departed 
and king rehoboam consulted with the old men that stood before 
solomon his father while he yet lived and said how do ye advise that 
i may answer this people and they spake unto him saying if 
thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day and wilt serve them 
and answer them and speak good words to them then they will be thy 
servants for ever 
but he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given 
him and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him and 
which stood before him and he said unto them what counsel give 
ye that we may answer this people who have spoken to me saying make 
the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter and the 
young men that were grown up with him spake unto him saying thus 
shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee saying thy 
father made our yoke heavy but make thou it lighter unto us thus 
shalt thou say unto them my little finger shall be thicker than my 
father s loins 
and now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke i will 
add to your yoke my father hath chastised you with whips but i will 
chastise you with scorpions 
so jeroboam and all the people came to rehoboam the third day 
as the king had appointed saying come to me again the third day 
and the king answered the people roughly and forsook the old 
men s counsel that they gave him and spake to them after the 
counsel of the young men saying my father made your yoke heavy and 
i will add to your yoke my father also chastised you with whips but 
i will chastise you with scorpions 
wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people for the because 
was from the lord that he might perform his saying which the lord 
spake by ahijah the shilonite unto jeroboam the son of nebat 
so when all israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them 
the people answered the king saying what portion have we in david 
neither have we inheritance in the son of jesse to your tents o 
israel now see to thine own house david so israel departed unto 
their tents 
but as for the children of israel which dwelt in the cities of 
judah rehoboam reigned over them 
then king rehoboam sent adoram who was over the tribute and 
all israel stoned him with stones that he died therefore king 
rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot to flee to 
jerusalem 
so israel rebelled against the house of david unto this day 
and it came to pass when all israel heard that jeroboam was 
come again that they sent and called him unto the congregation and 
made him king over all israel there was none that followed the house 
of david but the tribe of judah only 
and when rehoboam was come to jerusalem he assembled all the 
house of judah with the tribe of benjamin an hundred and fourscore 
thousand chosen men which were warriors to fight against the house 
of israel to bring the kingdom again to rehoboam the son of solomon 
but the word of god came unto shemaiah the man of god saying 
speak unto rehoboam the son of solomon king of judah and unto 
all the house of judah and benjamin and to the remnant of the people 
saying thus saith the lord ye shall not go up nor fight 
against your brethren the children of israel return every man to his 
house for this thing is from me they hearkened therefore to the word 
of the lord and returned to depart according to the word of the 
lord 
then jeroboam built shechem in mount ephraim and dwelt therein 
and went out from thence and built penuel 
and jeroboam said in his heart now shall the kingdom return to 
the house of david if this people go up to do sacrifice in the 
house of the lord at jerusalem then shall the heart of this people 
turn again unto their lord even unto rehoboam king of judah and they 
shall kill me and go again to rehoboam king of judah 
whereupon the king took counsel and made two calves of gold 
and said unto them it is too much for you to go up to jerusalem 
behold thy gods o israel which brought thee up out of the land of 
egypt 
and he set the one in bethel and the other put he in dan 
and this thing became a sin for the people went to worship 
before the one even unto dan 
and he made an house of high places and made priests of the 
lowest of the people which were not of the sons of levi 
and jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month on the 
fifteenth day of the month like unto the feast that is in judah and 
he offered upon the altar so did he in bethel sacrificing unto the 
calves that he had made and he placed in bethel the priests of the 
high places which he had made 
so he offered upon the altar which he had made in bethel the 
fifteenth day of the eighth month even in the month which he had 
devised of his own heart and ordained a feast unto the children of 
israel and he offered upon the altar and burnt incense 
and behold there came a man of god out of judah by the word of 
the lord unto bethel and jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense 
and he cried against the altar in the word of the lord and said 
o altar altar thus saith the lord behold a child shall be born 
unto the house of david josiah by name and upon thee shall he offer 
the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee and men s 
bones shall be burnt upon thee 
and he gave a sign the same day saying this is the sign which 
the lord hath spoken behold the altar shall be rent and the ashes 
that are upon it shall be poured out 
and it came to pass when king jeroboam heard the saying of the 
man of god which had cried against the altar in bethel that he put 
forth his hand from the altar saying lay hold on him and his hand 
which he put forth against him dried up so that he could not pull it 
in again to him 
the altar also was rent and the ashes poured out from the altar 
according to the sign which the man of god had given by the word of 
the lord 
and the king answered and said unto the man of god intreat now 
the face of the lord thy god and pray for me that my hand may be 
restored me again and the man of god besought the lord and the 
king s hand was restored him again and became as it was before 
and the king said unto the man of god come home with me and 
refresh thyself and i will give thee a reward 
and the man of god said unto the king if thou wilt give me half 
thine house i will not go in with thee neither will i eat bread nor 
drink water in this place for so was it charged me by the word 
of the lord saying eat no bread nor drink water nor turn again by 
the same way that thou camest 
so he went another way and returned not by the way that he came 
to bethel 
now there dwelt an old prophet in bethel and his sons came and 
told him all the works that the man of god had done that day in 
bethel the words which he had spoken unto the king them they told 
also to their father 
and their father said unto them what way went he for his sons 
had seen what way the man of god went which came from judah 
and he said unto his sons saddle me the ass so they saddled 
him the ass and he rode thereon and went after the man of god 
and found him sitting under an oak and he said unto him art thou the 
man of god that camest from judah and he said i am 
then he said unto him come home with me and eat bread 
and he said i may not return with thee nor go in with thee 
neither will i eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place 
for it was said to me by the word of the lord thou shalt eat no 
bread nor drink water there nor turn again to go by the way that thou 
camest 
he said unto him i am a prophet also as thou art and an angel 
spake unto me by the word of the lord saying bring him back with 
thee into thine house that he may eat bread and drink water but he 
lied unto him 
so he went back with him and did eat bread in his house and 
drank water 
and it came to pass as they sat at the table that the word of 
the lord came unto the prophet that brought him back and he 
cried unto the man of god that came from judah saying thus saith the 
lord forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the lord and hast 
not kept the commandment which the lord thy god commanded thee 
but camest back and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place of 
the which the lord did say to thee eat no bread and drink no water 
thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers 
and it came to pass after he had eaten bread and after he had 
drunk that he saddled for him the ass to wit for the prophet whom 
he had brought back 
and when he was gone a lion met him by the way and slew him 
and his carcase was cast in the way and the ass stood by it the lion 
also stood by the carcase 
and behold men passed by and saw the carcase cast in the way 
and the lion standing by the carcase and they came and told it in the 
city where the old prophet dwelt 
and when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard 
thereof he said it is the man of god who was disobedient unto the 
word of the lord therefore the lord hath delivered him unto the lion 
which hath torn him and slain him according to the word of the lord 
which he spake unto him 
and he spake to his sons saying saddle me the ass and they 
saddled him 
and he went and found his carcase cast in the way and the ass 
and the lion standing by the carcase the lion had not eaten the 
carcase nor torn the ass 
and the prophet took up the carcase of the man of god and laid 
it upon the ass and brought it back and the old prophet came to the 
city to mourn and to bury him 
and he laid his carcase in his own grave and they mourned over 
him saying alas my brother and it came to pass after he 
had buried him that he spake to his sons saying when i am dead 
then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of god is buried lay my 
bones beside his bones for the saying which he cried by the 
word of the lord against the altar in bethel and against all the 
houses of the high places which are in the cities of samaria shall 
surely come to pass 
after this thing jeroboam returned not from his evil way but 
made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places 
whosoever would he consecrated him and he became one of the priests 
of the high places 
and this thing became sin unto the house of jeroboam even to 
cut it off and to destroy it from off the face of the earth 
at that time abijah the son of jeroboam fell sick 
and jeroboam said to his wife arise i pray thee and disguise 
thyself that thou be not known to be the wife of jeroboam and get 
thee to shiloh behold there is ahijah the prophet which told me 
that i should be king over this people 
and take with thee ten loaves and cracknels and a cruse of 
honey and go to him he shall tell thee what shall become of the 
child 
and jeroboam s wife did so and arose and went to shiloh and 
came to the house of ahijah but ahijah could not see for his eyes 
were set by reason of his age 
and the lord said unto ahijah behold the wife of jeroboam 
cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son for he is sick thus and 
thus shalt thou say unto her for it shall be when she cometh in 
that she shall feign herself to be another woman 
and it was so when ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she 
came in at the door that he said come in thou wife of jeroboam why 
feignest thou thyself to be another for i am sent to thee with heavy 
tidings 
go tell jeroboam thus saith the lord god of israel forasmuch 
as i exalted thee from among the people and made thee prince over my 
people israel and rent the kingdom away from the house of david 
and gave it thee and yet thou hast not been as my servant david who 
kept my commandments and who followed me with all his heart to do 
that only which was right in mine eyes but hast done evil above 
all that were before thee for thou hast gone and made thee other 
gods and molten images to provoke me to anger and hast cast me 
behind thy back therefore behold i will bring evil upon the 
house of jeroboam and will cut off from jeroboam him that pisseth 
against the wall and him that is shut up and left in israel and will 
take away the remnant of the house of jeroboam as a man taketh away 
dung till it be all gone 
him that dieth of jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat and 
him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat for the 
lord hath spoken it 
arise thou therefore get thee to thine own house and when thy 
feet enter into the city the child shall die 
and all israel shall mourn for him and bury him for he only of 
jeroboam shall come to the grave because in him there is found some 
good thing toward the lord god of israel in the house of jeroboam 
moreover the lord shall raise him up a king over israel who 
shall cut off the house of jeroboam that day but what even now 
for the lord shall smite israel as a reed is shaken in the 
water and he shall root up israel out of this good land which he 
gave to their fathers and shall scatter them beyond the river 
because they have made their groves provoking the lord to anger 
and he shall give israel up because of the sins of jeroboam who 
did sin and who made israel to sin 
and jeroboam s wife arose and departed and came to tirzah and 
when she came to the threshold of the door the child died and 
they buried him and all israel mourned for him according to the word 
of the lord which he spake by the hand of his servant ahijah the 
prophet 
and the rest of the acts of jeroboam how he warred and how he 
reigned behold they are written in the book of the chronicles of the 
kings of israel 
and the days which jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years 
and he slept with his fathers and nadab his son reigned in his stead 
and rehoboam the son of solomon reigned in judah rehoboam was 
forty and one years old when he began to reign and he reigned 
seventeen years in jerusalem the city which the lord did choose out 
of all the tribes of israel to put his name there and his mother s 
name was naamah an ammonitess 
and judah did evil in the sight of the lord and they provoked 
him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed above all 
that their fathers had done 
for they also built them high places and images and groves on 
every high hill and under every green tree 
and there were also sodomites in the land and they did 
according to all the abominations of the nations which the lord cast 
out before the children of israel 
and it came to pass in the fifth year of king rehoboam that 
shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem and he took 
away the treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of the 
king s house he even took away all and he took away all the shields 
of gold which solomon had made 
and king rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields and 
committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard which kept 
the door of the king s house 
and it was so when the king went into the house of the lord 
that the guard bare them and brought them back into the guard 
chamber 
now the rest of the acts of rehoboam and all that he did are 
they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah 
and there was war between rehoboam and jeroboam all their days 
and rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried with his 
fathers in the city of david and his mother s name was naamah an 
ammonitess and abijam his son reigned in his stead 
now in the eighteenth year of king jeroboam the son of nebat 
reigned abijam over judah 
three years reigned he in jerusalem and his mother s name was 
maachah the daughter of abishalom 
and he walked in all the sins of his father which he had done 
before him and his heart was not perfect with the lord his god as 
the heart of david his father 
nevertheless for david s sake did the lord his god give him a 
lamp in jerusalem to set up his son after him and to establish 
jerusalem because david did that which was right in the eyes of 
the lord and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him 
all the days of his life save only in the matter of uriah the 
hittite 
and there was war between rehoboam and jeroboam all the days of 
his life 
now the rest of the acts of abijam and all that he did are they 
not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah and 
there was war between abijam and jeroboam 
and abijam slept with his fathers and they buried him in the 
city of david and asa his son reigned in his stead 
and in the twentieth year of jeroboam king of israel reigned asa 
over judah 
and forty and one years reigned he in jerusalem and his 
mother s name was maachah the daughter of abishalom 
and asa did that which was right in the eyes of the lord as did 
david his father 
and he took away the sodomites out of the land and removed all 
the idols that his fathers had made 
and also maachah his mother even her he removed from being 
queen because she had made an idol in a grove and asa destroyed her 
idol and burnt it by the brook kidron 
but the high places were not removed nevertheless asa s heart 
was perfect with the lord all his days 
and he brought in the things which his father had dedicated and 
the things which himself had dedicated into the house of the lord 
silver and gold and vessels 
and there was war between asa and baasha king of israel all 
their days 
and baasha king of israel went up against judah and built 
ramah that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to asa king 
of judah 
then asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the 
treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of the king s 
house and delivered them into the hand of his servants and king asa 
sent them to benhadad the son of tabrimon the son of hezion king of 
syria that dwelt at damascus saying there is a league between 
me and thee and between my father and thy father behold i have sent 
unto thee a present of silver and gold come and break thy league with 
baasha king of israel that he may depart from me 
so benhadad hearkened unto king asa and sent the captains of 
the hosts which he had against the cities of israel and smote ijon 
and dan and abelbethmaachah and all cinneroth with all the land of 
naphtali 
and it came to pass when baasha heard thereof that he left off 
building of ramah and dwelt in tirzah 
then king asa made a proclamation throughout all judah none was 
exempted and they took away the stones of ramah and the timber 
thereof wherewith baasha had builded and king asa built with them 
geba of benjamin and mizpah 
the rest of all the acts of asa and all his might and all that 
he did and the cities which he built are they not written in the 
book of the chronicles of the kings of judah nevertheless in the time 
of his old age he was diseased in his feet 
and asa slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers 
in the city of david his father and jehoshaphat his son reigned in 
his stead 
and nadab the son of jeroboam began to reign over israel in the 
second year of asa king of judah and reigned over israel two years 
and he did evil in the sight of the lord and walked in the way 
of his father and in his sin wherewith he made israel to sin 
and baasha the son of ahijah of the house of issachar 
conspired against him and baasha smote him at gibbethon which 
belonged to the philistines for nadab and all israel laid siege to 
gibbethon 
even in the third year of asa king of judah did baasha slay him 
and reigned in his stead 
and it came to pass when he reigned that he smote all the 
house of jeroboam he left not to jeroboam any that breathed until he 
had destroyed him according unto the saying of the lord which he 
spake by his servant ahijah the shilonite because of the sins 
of jeroboam which he sinned and which he made israel sin by his 
provocation wherewith he provoked the lord god of israel to anger 
now the rest of the acts of nadab and all that he did are they 
not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel 
and there was war between asa and baasha king of israel all 
their days 
in the third year of asa king of judah began baasha the son of 
ahijah to reign over all israel in tirzah twenty and four years 
and he did evil in the sight of the lord and walked in the way 
of jeroboam and in his sin wherewith he made israel to sin 
then the word of the lord came to jehu the son of hanani against 
baasha saying forasmuch as i exalted thee out of the dust and 
made thee prince over my people israel and thou hast walked in the 
way of jeroboam and hast made my people israel to sin to provoke me 
to anger with their sins behold i will take away the posterity 
of baasha and the posterity of his house and will make thy house 
like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat 
him that dieth of baasha in the city shall the dogs eat and him 
that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat 
now the rest of the acts of baasha and what he did and his 
might are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings 
of israel so baasha slept with his fathers and was buried in 
tirzah and elah his son reigned in his stead 
and also by the hand of the prophet jehu the son of hanani came 
the word of the lord against baasha and against his house even for 
all the evil that he did in the sight of the lord in provoking him to 
anger with the work of his hands in being like the house of jeroboam 
and because he killed him 
in the twenty and sixth year of asa king of judah began elah the 
son of baasha to reign over israel in tirzah two years 
and his servant zimri captain of half his chariots conspired 
against him as he was in tirzah drinking himself drunk in the house 
of arza steward of his house in tirzah 
and zimri went in and smote him and killed him in the twenty 
and seventh year of asa king of judah and reigned in his stead 
and it came to pass when he began to reign as soon as he sat 
on his throne that he slew all the house of baasha he left him not 
one that pisseth against a wall neither of his kinsfolks nor of his 
friends 
thus did zimri destroy all the house of baasha according to the 
word of the lord which he spake against baasha by jehu the prophet 
for all the sins of baasha and the sins of elah his son by 
which they sinned and by which they made israel to sin in provoking 
the lord god of israel to anger with their vanities 
now the rest of the acts of elah and all that he did are they 
not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel 
in the twenty and seventh year of asa king of judah did zimri 
reign seven days in tirzah and the people were encamped against 
gibbethon which belonged to the philistines 
and the people that were encamped heard say zimri hath 
conspired and hath also slain the king wherefore all israel made 
omri the captain of the host king over israel that day in the camp 
and omri went up from gibbethon and all israel with him and 
they besieged tirzah 
and it came to pass when zimri saw that the city was taken 
that he went into the palace of the king s house and burnt the king s 
house over him with fire and died 
for his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the 
lord in walking in the way of jeroboam and in his sin which he did 
to make israel to sin 
now the rest of the acts of zimri and his treason that he 
wrought are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the 
kings of israel then were the people of israel divided into 
two parts half of the people followed tibni the son of ginath to 
make him king and half followed omri 
but the people that followed omri prevailed against the people 
that followed tibni the son of ginath so tibni died and omri 
reigned 
in the thirty and first year of asa king of judah began omri to 
reign over israel twelve years six years reigned he in tirzah 
and he bought the hill samaria of shemer for two talents of 
silver and built on the hill and called the name of the city which 
he built after the name of shemer owner of the hill samaria 
but omri wrought evil in the eyes of the lord and did worse 
than all that were before him 
for he walked in all the way of jeroboam the son of nebat and 
in his sin wherewith he made israel to sin to provoke the lord god of 
israel to anger with their vanities 
now the rest of the acts of omri which he did and his might 
that he shewed are they not written in the book of the chronicles of 
the kings of israel so omri slept with his fathers and was 
buried in samaria and ahab his son reigned in his stead 
and in the thirty and eighth year of asa king of judah began 
ahab the son of omri to reign over israel and ahab the son of omri 
reigned over israel in samaria twenty and two years 
and ahab the son of omri did evil in the sight of the lord above 
all that were before him 
and it came to pass as if it had been a light thing for him to 
walk in the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat that he took to wife 
jezebel the daughter of ethbaal king of the zidonians and went and 
served baal and worshipped him 
and he reared up an altar for baal in the house of baal which 
he had built in samaria 
and ahab made a grove and ahab did more to provoke the lord god 
of israel to anger than all the kings of israel that were before him 
in his days did hiel the bethelite build jericho he laid the 
foundation thereof in abiram his firstborn and set up the gates 
thereof in his youngest son segub according to the word of the lord 
which he spake by joshua the son of nun 
and elijah the tishbite who was of the inhabitants of gilead 
said unto ahab as the lord god of israel liveth before whom i stand 
there shall not be dew nor rain these years but according to my word 
and the word of the lord came unto him saying get thee 
hence and turn thee eastward and hide thyself by the brook cherith 
that is before jordan 
and it shall be that thou shalt drink of the brook and i have 
commanded the ravens to feed thee there 
so he went and did according unto the word of the lord for he 
went and dwelt by the brook cherith that is before jordan 
and the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning and 
bread and flesh in the evening and he drank of the brook 
and it came to pass after a while that the brook dried up 
because there had been no rain in the land 
and the word of the lord came unto him saying arise get 
thee to zarephath which belongeth to zidon and dwell there behold 
i have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee 
so he arose and went to zarephath and when he came to the gate 
of the city behold the widow woman was there gathering of sticks 
and he called to her and said fetch me i pray thee a little water 
in a vessel that i may drink 
and as she was going to fetch it he called to her and said 
bring me i pray thee a morsel of bread in thine hand 
and she said as the lord thy god liveth i have not a cake but 
an handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil in a cruse and 
behold i am gathering two sticks that i may go in and dress it for 
me and my son that we may eat it and die 
and elijah said unto her fear not go and do as thou hast said 
but make me thereof a little cake first and bring it unto me and 
after make for thee and for thy son 
for thus saith the lord god of israel the barrel of meal shall 
not waste neither shall the cruse of oil fail until the day that the 
lord sendeth rain upon the earth 
and she went and did according to the saying of elijah and she 
and he and her house did eat many days 
and the barrel of meal wasted not neither did the cruse of oil 
fail according to the word of the lord which he spake by elijah 
and it came to pass after these things that the son of the 
woman the mistress of the house fell sick and his sickness was so 
sore that there was no breath left in him 
and she said unto elijah what have i to do with thee o thou 
man of god art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance and 
to slay my son and he said unto her give me thy son and he 
took him out of her bosom and carried him up into a loft where he 
abode and laid him upon his own bed 
and he cried unto the lord and said o lord my god hast thou 
also brought evil upon the widow with whom i sojourn by slaying her 
son and he stretched himself upon the child three times and 
cried unto the lord and said o lord my god i pray thee let this 
child s soul come into him again 
and the lord heard the voice of elijah and the soul of the 
child came into him again and he revived 
and elijah took the child and brought him down out of the 
chamber into the house and delivered him unto his mother and elijah 
said see thy son liveth 
and the woman said to elijah now by this i know that thou art a 
man of god and that the word of the lord in thy mouth is truth 
and it came to pass after many days that the word of the lord 
came to elijah in the third year saying go shew thyself unto ahab 
and i will send rain upon the earth 
and elijah went to shew himself unto ahab and there was a sore 
famine in samaria 
and ahab called obadiah which was the governor of his house 
now obadiah feared the lord greatly for it was so when jezebel 
cut off the prophets of the lord that obadiah took an hundred 
prophets and hid them by fifty in a cave and fed them with bread and 
water and ahab said unto obadiah go into the land unto all 
fountains of water and unto all brooks peradventure we may find 
grass to save the horses and mules alive that we lose not all the 
beasts 
so they divided the land between them to pass throughout it ahab 
went one way by himself and obadiah went another way by himself 
and as obadiah was in the way behold elijah met him and he 
knew him and fell on his face and said art thou that my lord 
elijah and he answered him i am go tell thy lord behold 
elijah is here 
and he said what have i sinned that thou wouldest deliver thy 
servant into the hand of ahab to slay me as the lord thy god 
liveth there is no nation or kingdom whither my lord hath not sent 
to seek thee and when they said he is not there he took an oath of 
the kingdom and nation that they found thee not 
and now thou sayest go tell thy lord behold elijah is here 
and it shall come to pass as soon as i am gone from thee that 
the spirit of the lord shall carry thee whither i know not and so 
when i come and tell ahab and he cannot find thee he shall slay me 
but i thy servant fear the lord from my youth 
was it not told my lord what i did when jezebel slew the 
prophets of the lord how i hid an hundred men of the lord s prophets 
by fifty in a cave and fed them with bread and water and now 
thou sayest go tell thy lord behold elijah is here and he shall 
slay me 
and elijah said as the lord of hosts liveth before whom i 
stand i will surely shew myself unto him to day 
so obadiah went to meet ahab and told him and ahab went to 
meet elijah 
and it came to pass when ahab saw elijah that ahab said unto 
him art thou he that troubleth israel and he answered i have 
not troubled israel but thou and thy father s house in that ye have 
forsaken the commandments of the lord and thou hast followed baalim 
now therefore send and gather to me all israel unto mount 
carmel and the prophets of baal four hundred and fifty and the 
prophets of the groves four hundred which eat at jezebel s table 
so ahab sent unto all the children of israel and gathered the 
prophets together unto mount carmel 
and elijah came unto all the people and said how long halt ye 
between two opinions if the lord be god follow him but if baal 
then follow him and the people answered him not a word 
then said elijah unto the people i even i only remain a 
prophet of the lord but baal s prophets are four hundred and fifty 
men 
let them therefore give us two bullocks and let them choose one 
bullock for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on wood and 
put no fire under and i will dress the other bullock and lay it on 
wood and put no fire under and call ye on the name of your 
gods and i will call on the name of the lord and the god that 
answereth by fire let him be god and all the people answered and 
said it is well spoken 
and elijah said unto the prophets of baal choose you one 
bullock for yourselves and dress it first for ye are many and call 
on the name of your gods but put no fire under 
and they took the bullock which was given them and they dressed 
it and called on the name of baal from morning even until noon 
saying o baal hear us but there was no voice nor any that 
answered and they leaped upon the altar which was made 
and it came to pass at noon that elijah mocked them and said 
cry aloud for he is a god either he is talking or he is pursuing 
or he is in a journey or peradventure he sleepeth and must be 
awaked 
and they cried aloud and cut themselves after their manner with 
knives and lancets till the blood gushed out upon them 
and it came to pass when midday was past and they prophesied 
until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that there 
was neither voice nor any to answer nor any that regarded 
and elijah said unto all the people come near unto me and all 
the people came near unto him and he repaired the altar of the lord 
that was broken down 
and elijah took twelve stones according to the number of the 
tribes of the sons of jacob unto whom the word of the lord came 
saying israel shall be thy name and with the stones he built 
an altar in the name of the lord and he made a trench about the 
altar as great as would contain two measures of seed 
and he put the wood in order and cut the bullock in pieces and 
laid him on the wood and said fill four barrels with water and pour 
it on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood 
and he said do it the second time and they did it the second 
time 
and he said do it the third time and they did it the third time 
and the water ran round about the altar and he filled the 
trench also with water 
and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening 
sacrifice that elijah the prophet came near and said lord god of 
abraham isaac and of israel let it be known this day that thou art 
god in israel and that i am thy servant and that i have done all 
these things at thy word 
hear me o lord hear me that this people may know that thou 
art the lord god and that thou hast turned their heart back again 
then the fire of the lord fell and consumed the burnt 
sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up 
the water that was in the trench 
and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and 
they said the lord he is the god the lord he is the god 
and elijah said unto them take the prophets of baal let not 
one of them escape and they took them and elijah brought them down 
to the brook kishon and slew them there 
and elijah said unto ahab get thee up eat and drink for there 
is a sound of abundance of rain 
so ahab went up to eat and to drink and elijah went up to the 
top of carmel and he cast himself down upon the earth and put his 
face between his knees and said to his servant go up now look 
toward the sea and he went up and looked and said there is 
nothing and he said go again seven times 
and it came to pass at the seventh time that he said behold 
there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea like a man s hand and he 
said go up say unto ahab prepare thy chariot and get thee down 
that the rain stop thee not 
and it came to pass in the mean while that the heaven was black 
with clouds and wind and there was a great rain and ahab rode and 
went to jezreel 
and the hand of the lord was on elijah and he girded up his 
loins and ran before ahab to the entrance of jezreel 
and ahab told jezebel all that elijah had done and withal how he 
had slain all the prophets with the sword 
then jezebel sent a messenger unto elijah saying so let the 
gods do to me and more also if i make not thy life as the life of 
one of them by to morrow about this time 
and when he saw that he arose and went for his life and came 
to beersheba which belongeth to judah and left his servant there 
but he himself went a day s journey into the wilderness and came 
and sat down under a juniper tree and he requested for himself that 
he might die and said it is enough now o lord take away my life 
for i am not better than my fathers 
and as he lay and slept under a juniper tree behold then an 
angel touched him and said unto him arise and eat 
and he looked and behold there was a cake baken on the coals 
and a cruse of water at his head and he did eat and drink and laid 
him down again 
and the angel of the lord came again the second time and touched 
him and said arise and eat because the journey is too great for 
thee 
and he arose and did eat and drink and went in the strength of 
that meat forty days and forty nights unto horeb the mount of god 
and he came thither unto a cave and lodged there and behold 
the word of the lord came to him and he said unto him what doest 
thou here elijah and he said i have been very jealous for 
the lord god of hosts for the children of israel have forsaken thy 
covenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the 
sword and i even i only am left and they seek my life to take it 
away 
and he said go forth and stand upon the mount before the lord 
and behold the lord passed by and a great and strong wind rent the 
mountains and brake in pieces the rocks before the lord but the lord 
was not in the wind and after the wind an earthquake but the lord 
was not in the earthquake and after the earthquake a fire but 
the lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still small voice 
and it was so when elijah heard it that he wrapped his face in 
his mantle and went out and stood in the entering in of the cave 
and behold there came a voice unto him and said what doest thou 
here elijah and he said i have been very jealous for the 
lord god of hosts because the children of israel have forsaken thy 
covenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the 
sword and i even i only am left and they seek my life to take it 
away 
and the lord said unto him go return on thy way to the 
wilderness of damascus and when thou comest anoint hazael to be king 
over syria and jehu the son of nimshi shalt thou anoint to be 
king over israel and elisha the son of shaphat of abelmeholah shalt 
thou anoint to be prophet in thy room 
and it shall come to pass that him that escapeth the sword of 
hazael shall jehu slay and him that escapeth from the sword of jehu 
shall elisha slay 
yet i have left me seven thousand in israel all the knees which 
have not bowed unto baal and every mouth which hath not kissed him 
so he departed thence and found elisha the son of shaphat who 
was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him and he with the 
twelfth and elijah passed by him and cast his mantle upon him 
and he left the oxen and ran after elijah and said let me i 
pray thee kiss my father and my mother and then i will follow thee 
and he said unto him go back again for what have i done to thee 
and he returned back from him and took a yoke of oxen and slew 
them and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen and 
gave unto the people and they did eat then he arose and went after 
elijah and ministered unto him 
and benhadad the king of syria gathered all his host together 
and there were thirty and two kings with him and horses and 
chariots and he went up and besieged samaria and warred against it 
and he sent messengers to ahab king of israel into the city and 
said unto him thus saith benhadad thy silver and thy gold is 
mine thy wives also and thy children even the goodliest are mine 
and the king of israel answered and said my lord o king 
according to thy saying i am thine and all that i have 
and the messengers came again and said thus speaketh benhadad 
saying although i have sent unto thee saying thou shalt deliver me 
thy silver and thy gold and thy wives and thy children yet i 
will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time and they 
shall search thine house and the houses of thy servants and it shall 
be that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes they shall put it in 
their hand and take it away 
then the king of israel called all the elders of the land and 
said mark i pray you and see how this man seeketh mischief for he 
sent unto me for my wives and for my children and for my silver and 
for my gold and i denied him not 
and all the elders and all the people said unto him hearken not 
unto him nor consent 
wherefore he said unto the messengers of benhadad tell my lord 
the king all that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first i 
will do but this thing i may not do and the messengers departed and 
brought him word again 
and benhadad sent unto him and said the gods do so unto me 
and more also if the dust of samaria shall suffice for handfuls for 
all the people that follow me 
and the king of israel answered and said tell him let not him 
that girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that putteth it off 
and it came to pass when ben hadad heard this message as he 
was drinking he and the kings in the pavilions that he said unto his 
servants set yourselves in array and they set themselves in array 
against the city 
and behold there came a prophet unto ahab king of israel 
saying thus saith the lord hast thou seen all this great multitude 
behold i will deliver it into thine hand this day and thou shalt 
know that i am the lord 
and ahab said by whom and he said thus saith the lord even 
by the young men of the princes of the provinces then he said who 
shall order the battle and he answered thou 
then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces 
and they were two hundred and thirty two and after them he numbered 
all the people even all the children of israel being seven thousand 
and they went out at noon but benhadad was drinking himself 
drunk in the pavilions he and the kings the thirty and two kings 
that helped him 
and the young men of the princes of the provinces went out 
first and benhadad sent out and they told him saying there are men 
come out of samaria 
and he said whether they be come out for peace take them 
alive or whether they be come out for war take them alive 
so these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of 
the city and the army which followed them 
and they slew every one his man and the syrians fled and 
israel pursued them and benhadad the king of syria escaped on an 
horse with the horsemen 
and the king of israel went out and smote the horses and 
chariots and slew the syrians with a great slaughter 
and the prophet came to the king of israel and said unto him 
go strengthen thyself and mark and see what thou doest for at the 
return of the year the king of syria will come up against thee 
and the servants of the king of syria said unto him their gods 
are gods of the hills therefore they were stronger than we but let 
us fight against them in the plain and surely we shall be stronger 
than they 
and do this thing take the kings away every man out of his 
place and put captains in their rooms and number thee an army 
like the army that thou hast lost horse for horse and chariot for 
chariot and we will fight against them in the plain and surely we 
shall be stronger than they and he hearkened unto their voice and 
did so 
and it came to pass at the return of the year that benhadad 
numbered the syrians and went up to aphek to fight against israel 
and the children of israel were numbered and were all present 
and went against them and the children of israel pitched before them 
like two little flocks of kids but the syrians filled the country 
and there came a man of god and spake unto the king of israel 
and said thus saith the lord because the syrians have said the lord 
is god of the hills but he is not god of the valleys therefore will 
i deliver all this great multitude into thine hand and ye shall know 
that i am the lord 
and they pitched one over against the other seven days and so 
it was that in the seventh day the battle was joined and the 
children of israel slew of the syrians an hundred thousand footmen in 
one day 
but the rest fled to aphek into the city and there a wall fell 
upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left and benhadad 
fled and came into the city into an inner chamber 
and his servants said unto him behold now we have heard that 
the kings of the house of israel are merciful kings let us i pray 
thee put sackcloth on our loins and ropes upon our heads and go out 
to the king of israel peradventure he will save thy life 
so they girded sackcloth on their loins and put ropes on their 
heads and came to the king of israel and said thy servant benhadad 
saith i pray thee let me live and he said is he yet alive he is 
my brother 
now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would come 
from him and did hastily catch it and they said thy brother 
benhadad then he said go ye bring him then benhadad came forth to 
him and he caused him to come up into the chariot 
and ben hadad said unto him the cities which my father took 
from thy father i will restore and thou shalt make streets for thee 
in damascus as my father made in samaria then said ahab i will send 
thee away with this covenant so he made a covenant with him and sent 
him away 
and a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his 
neighbour in the word of the lord smite me i pray thee and the man 
refused to smite him 
then said he unto him because thou hast not obeyed the voice of 
the lord behold as soon as thou art departed from me a lion shall 
slay thee 
and as soon as he was departed from him a lion found him and slew 
him 
then he found another man and said smite me i pray thee and 
the man smote him so that in smiting he wounded him 
so the prophet departed and waited for the king by the way and 
disguised himself with ashes upon his face 
and as the king passed by he cried unto the king and he said 
thy servant went out into the midst of the battle and behold a man 
turned aside and brought a man unto me and said keep this man if 
by any means he be missing then shall thy life be for his life or 
else thou shalt pay a talent of silver 
and as thy servant was busy here and there he was gone and the 
king of israel said unto him so shall thy judgment be thyself hast 
decided it 
and he hasted and took the ashes away from his face and the 
king of israel discerned him that he was of the prophets 
and he said unto him thus saith the lord because thou hast let 
go out of thy hand a man whom i appointed to utter destruction 
therefore thy life shall go for his life and thy people for his 
people 
and the king of israel went to his house heavy and displeased 
and came to samaria 
and it came to pass after these things that naboth the 
jezreelite had a vineyard which was in jezreel hard by the palace of 
ahab king of samaria 
and ahab spake unto naboth saying give me thy vineyard that i 
may have it for a garden of herbs because it is near unto my house 
and i will give thee for it a better vineyard than it or if it seem 
good to thee i will give thee the worth of it in money 
and naboth said to ahab the lord forbid it me that i should 
give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee 
and ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the 
word which naboth the jezreelite had spoken to him for he had said i 
will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers and he laid him down 
upon his bed and turned away his face and would eat no bread 
but jezebel his wife came to him and said unto him why is thy 
spirit so sad that thou eatest no bread and he said unto her 
because i spake unto naboth the jezreelite and said unto him give me 
thy vineyard for money or else if it please thee i will give thee 
another vineyard for it and he answered i will not give thee my 
vineyard 
and jezebel his wife said unto him dost thou now govern the 
kingdom of israel arise and eat bread and let thine heart be merry 
i will give thee the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite 
so she wrote letters in ahab s name and sealed them with his 
seal and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were 
in his city dwelling with naboth 
and she wrote in the letters saying proclaim a fast and set 
naboth on high among the people and set two men sons of 
belial before him to bear witness against him saying thou didst 
blaspheme god and the king and then carry him out and stone him 
that he may die 
and the men of his city even the elders and the nobles who were 
the inhabitants in his city did as jezebel had sent unto them and as 
it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them 
they proclaimed a fast and set naboth on high among the people 
and there came in two men children of belial and sat before 
him and the men of belial witnessed against him even against naboth 
in the presence of the people saying naboth did blaspheme god and 
the king then they carried him forth out of the city and stoned him 
with stones that he died 
then they sent to jezebel saying naboth is stoned and is 
dead 
and it came to pass when jezebel heard that naboth was stoned 
and was dead that jezebel said to ahab arise take possession of the 
vineyard of naboth the jezreelite which he refused to give thee for 
money for naboth is not alive but dead 
and it came to pass when ahab heard that naboth was dead that 
ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite to 
take possession of it 
and the word of the lord came to elijah the tishbite saying 
arise go down to meet ahab king of israel which is in samaria 
behold he is in the vineyard of naboth whither he is gone down to 
possess it 
and thou shalt speak unto him saying thus saith the lord hast 
thou killed and also taken possession and thou shalt speak unto him 
saying thus saith the lord in the place where dogs licked the blood 
of naboth shall dogs lick thy blood even thine 
and ahab said to elijah hast thou found me o mine enemy and 
he answered i have found thee because thou hast sold thyself to work 
evil in the sight of the lord 
behold i will bring evil upon thee and will take away thy 
posterity and will cut off from ahab him that pisseth against the 
wall and him that is shut up and left in israel and will make 
thine house like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat and like the 
house of baasha the son of ahijah for the provocation wherewith thou 
hast provoked me to anger and made israel to sin 
and of jezebel also spake the lord saying the dogs shall eat 
jezebel by the wall of jezreel 
him that dieth of ahab in the city the dogs shall eat and him 
that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat 
but there was none like unto ahab which did sell himself to 
work wickedness in the sight of the lord whom jezebel his wife 
stirred up 
and he did very abominably in following idols according to all 
things as did the amorites whom the lord cast out before the children 
of israel 
and it came to pass when ahab heard those words that he rent 
his clothes and put sackcloth upon his flesh and fasted and lay in 
sackcloth and went softly 
and the word of the lord came to elijah the tishbite saying 
seest thou how ahab humbleth himself before me because he 
humbleth himself before me i will not bring the evil in his days but 
in his son s days will i bring the evil upon his house 
and they continued three years without war between syria and 
israel 
and it came to pass in the third year that jehoshaphat the king 
of judah came down to the king of israel 
and the king of israel said unto his servants know ye that 
ramoth in gilead is ours and we be still and take it not out of the 
hand of the king of syria and he said unto jehoshaphat wilt 
thou go with me to battle to ramothgilead and jehoshaphat said to the 
king of israel i am as thou art my people as thy people my horses 
as thy horses 
and jehoshaphat said unto the king of israel enquire i pray 
thee at the word of the lord to day 
then the king of israel gathered the prophets together about 
four hundred men and said unto them shall i go against ramothgilead 
to battle or shall i forbear and they said go up for the lord 
shall deliver it into the hand of the king 
and jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the lord 
besides that we might enquire of him and the king of israel 
said unto jehoshaphat there is yet one man micaiah the son of imlah 
by whom we may enquire of the lord but i hate him for he doth not 
prophesy good concerning me but evil and jehoshaphat said let not 
the king say so 
then the king of israel called an officer and said hasten 
hither micaiah the son of imlah 
and the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah sat 
each on his throne having put on their robes in a void place in the 
entrance of the gate of samaria and all the prophets prophesied 
before them 
and zedekiah the son of chenaanah made him horns of iron and he 
said thus saith the lord with these shalt thou push the syrians 
until thou have consumed them 
and all the prophets prophesied so saying go up to 
ramothgilead and prosper for the lord shall deliver it into the 
king s hand 
and the messenger that was gone to call micaiah spake unto him 
saying behold now the words of the prophets declare good unto the 
king with one mouth let thy word i pray thee be like the word of 
one of them and speak that which is good 
and micaiah said as the lord liveth what the lord saith unto 
me that will i speak 
so he came to the king and the king said unto him micaiah 
shall we go against ramothgilead to battle or shall we forbear and 
he answered him go and prosper for the lord shall deliver it into 
the hand of the king 
and the king said unto him how many times shall i adjure thee 
that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the 
lord and he said i saw all israel scattered upon the hills 
as sheep that have not a shepherd and the lord said these have no 
master let them return every man to his house in peace 
and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat did i not tell 
thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me but evil 
and he said hear thou therefore the word of the lord i saw the lord 
sitting on his throne and all the host of heaven standing by him on 
his right hand and on his left 
and the lord said who shall persuade ahab that he may go up 
and fall at ramothgilead and one said on this manner and another 
said on that manner 
and there came forth a spirit and stood before the lord and 
said i will persuade him 
and the lord said unto him wherewith and he said i will go 
forth and i will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets 
and he said thou shalt persude him and prevail also go forth and 
do so 
now therefore behold the lord hath put a lying spirit in the 
mouth of all these thy prophets and the lord hath spoken evil 
concerning thee 
but zedekiah the son of chenaanah went near and smote micaiah 
on the cheek and said which way went the spirit of the lord from me 
to speak unto thee and micaiah said behold thou shalt see in 
that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself 
and the king of israel said take micaiah and carry him back 
unto amon the governor of the city and to joash the king s son 
and say thus saith the king put this fellow in the prison and feed 
him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction until i 
come in peace 
and micaiah said if thou return at all in peace the lord hath 
not spoken by me and he said hearken o people every one of you 
so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah went up 
to ramothgilead 
and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat i will disguise 
myself and enter into the battle but put thou on thy robes and the 
king of israel disguised himself and went into the battle 
but the king of syria commanded his thirty and two captains that 
had rule over his chariots saying fight neither with small nor 
great save only with the king of israel 
and it came to pass when the captains of the chariots saw 
jehoshaphat that they said surely it is the king of israel and they 
turned aside to fight against him and jehoshaphat cried out 
and it came to pass when the captains of the chariots perceived 
that it was not the king of israel that they turned back from 
pursuing him 
and a certain man drew a bow at a venture and smote the king of 
israel between the joints of the harness wherefore he said unto the 
driver of his chariot turn thine hand and carry me out of the host 
for i am wounded 
and the battle increased that day and the king was stayed up in 
his chariot against the syrians and died at even and the blood ran 
out of the wound into the midst of the chariot 
and there went a proclamation throughout the host about the 
going down of the sun saying every man to his city and every man to 
his own country 
so the king died and was brought to samaria and they buried 
the king in samaria 
and one washed the chariot in the pool of samaria and the dogs 
licked up his blood and they washed his armour according unto the 
word of the lord which he spake 
now the rest of the acts of ahab and all that he did and the 
ivory house which he made and all the cities that he built are they 
not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel 
so ahab slept with his fathers and ahaziah his son reigned in 
his stead 
and jehoshaphat the son of asa began to reign over judah in the 
fourth year of ahab king of israel 
jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to 
reign and he reigned twenty and five years in jerusalem and his 
mother s name was azubah the daughter of shilhi 
and he walked in all the ways of asa his father he turned not 
aside from it doing that which was right in the eyes of the lord 
nevertheless the high places were not taken away for the people 
offered and burnt incense yet in the high places 
and jehoshaphat made peace with the king of israel 
now the rest of the acts of jehoshaphat and his might that he 
shewed and how he warred are they not written in the book of the 
chronicles of the kings of judah and the remnant of the 
sodomites which remained in the days of his father asa he took out 
of the land 
there was then no king in edom a deputy was king 
jehoshaphat made ships of tharshish to go to ophir for gold but 
they went not for the ships were broken at eziongeber 
then said ahaziah the son of ahab unto jehoshaphat let my 
servants go with thy servants in the ships but jehoshaphat would not 
and jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his 
fathers in the city of david his father and jehoram his son reigned 
in his stead 
ahaziah the son of ahab began to reign over israel in samaria 
the seventeenth year of jehoshaphat king of judah and reigned two 
years over israel 
and he did evil in the sight of the lord and walked in the way 
of his father and in the way of his mother and in the way of 
jeroboam the son of nebat who made israel to sin for he served 
baal and worshipped him and provoked to anger the lord god of 
israel according to all that his father had done 
the first book of the kings 
commonly called 
the fourth book of the kings 
then moab rebelled against israel after the death of ahab 
and ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that 
was in samaria and was sick and he sent messengers and said unto 
them go enquire of baalzebub the god of ekron whether i shall 
recover of this disease 
but the angel of the lord said to elijah the tishbite arise go 
up to meet the messengers of the king of samaria and say unto them 
is it not because there is not a god in israel that ye go to enquire 
of baalzebub the god of ekron now therefore thus saith the lord 
thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up but 
shalt surely die and elijah departed 
and when the messengers turned back unto him he said unto them 
why are ye now turned back and they said unto him there came a 
man up to meet us and said unto us go turn again unto the king that 
sent you and say unto him thus saith the lord is it not because 
there is not a god in israel that thou sendest to enquire of 
baalzebub the god of ekron therefore thou shalt not come down from 
that bed on which thou art gone up but shalt surely die 
and he said unto them what manner of man was he which came up to 
meet you and told you these words and they answered him he was 
an hairy man and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins and 
he said it is elijah the tishbite 
then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty and 
he went up to him and behold he sat on the top of an hill and he 
spake unto him thou man of god the king hath said come down 
and elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty if i be a 
man of god then let fire come down from heaven and consume thee and 
thy fifty 
and there came down fire from heaven and consumed him and his fifty 
again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his 
fifty 
and he answered and said unto him o man of god thus hath the king 
said come down quickly 
and elijah answered and said unto them if i be a man of god let 
fire come down from heaven and consume thee and thy fifty and the 
fire of god came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty 
and he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty 
and the third captain of fifty went up and came and fell on his knees 
before elijah and besought him and said unto him o man of god i 
pray thee let my life and the life of these fifty thy servants be 
precious in thy sight 
behold there came fire down from heaven and burnt up the two 
captains of the former fifties with their fifties therefore let my 
life now be precious in thy sight 
and the angel of the lord said unto elijah go down with him be 
not afraid of him and he arose and went down with him unto the king 
and he said unto him thus saith the lord forasmuch as thou hast 
sent messengers to enquire of baalzebub the god of ekron is it not 
because there is no god in israel to enquire of his word therefore 
thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up but 
shalt surely die 
so he died according to the word of the lord which elijah had 
spoken 
and jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of jehoram the son 
of jehoshaphat king of judah because he had no son 
now the rest of the acts of ahaziah which he did are they not 
written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel and 
it came to pass when the lord would take up elijah into heaven by a 
whirlwind that elijah went with elisha from gilgal 
and elijah said unto elisha tarry here i pray thee for the lord 
hath sent me to bethel and elisha said unto him as the lord liveth 
and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee so they went down to 
bethel 
and the sons of the prophets that were at bethel came forth to 
elisha and said unto him knowest thou that the lord will take away 
thy master from thy head to day and he said yea i know it hold ye 
your peace 
and elijah said unto him elisha tarry here i pray thee for the 
lord hath sent me to jericho and he said as the lord liveth and as 
thy soul liveth i will not leave thee so they came to jericho 
and the sons of the prophets that were at jericho came to elisha 
and said unto him knowest thou that the lord will take away thy 
master from thy head to day and he answered yea i know it hold ye 
your peace 
and elijah said unto him tarry i pray thee here for the lord 
hath sent me to jordan and he said as the lord liveth and as thy 
soul liveth i will not leave thee and they two went on 
and fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood to view 
afar off and they two stood by jordan 
and elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smote the 
waters and they were divided hither and thither so that they two 
went over on dry ground 
and it came to pass when they were gone over that elijah said 
unto elisha ask what i shall do for thee before i be taken away from 
thee and elisha said i pray thee let a double portion of thy spirit 
be upon me 
and he said thou hast asked a hard thing nevertheless if thou 
see me when i am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if 
not it shall not be so 
and it came to pass as they still went on and talked that 
behold there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire and 
parted them both asunder and elijah went up by a whirlwind into 
heaven 
and elisha saw it and he cried my father my father the 
chariot of israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more 
and he took hold of his own clothes and rent them in two pieces 
he took up also the mantle of elijah that fell from him and went 
back and stood by the bank of jordan and he took the mantle of 
elijah that fell from him and smote the waters and said where is 
the lord god of elijah and when he also had smitten the waters they 
parted hither and thither and elisha went over 
and when the sons of the prophets which were to view at jericho 
saw him they said the spirit of elijah doth rest on elisha and they 
came to meet him and bowed themselves to the ground before him 
and they said unto him behold now there be with thy servants 
fifty strong men let them go we pray thee and seek thy master lest 
peradventure the spirit of the lord hath taken him up and cast him 
upon some mountain or into some valley and he said ye shall not 
send 
and when they urged him till he was ashamed he said send they 
sent therefore fifty men and they sought three days but found him 
not 
and when they came again to him for he tarried at jericho he 
said unto them did i not say unto you go not and the men of 
the city said unto elisha behold i pray thee the situation of this 
city is pleasant as my lord seeth but the water is naught and the 
ground barren 
and he said bring me a new cruse and put salt therein and they 
brought it to him 
and he went forth unto the spring of the waters and cast the 
salt in there and said thus saith the lord i have healed these 
waters there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land 
so the waters were healed unto this day according to the saying 
of elisha which he spake 
and he went up from thence unto bethel and as he was going up by 
the way there came forth little children out of the city and mocked 
him and said unto him go up thou bald head go up thou bald head 
and he turned back and looked on them and cursed them in the 
name of the lord and there came forth two she bears out of the wood 
and tare forty and two children of them 
and he went from thence to mount carmel and from thence he 
returned to samaria 
now jehoram the son of ahab began to reign over israel in samaria 
the eighteenth year of jehoshaphat king of judah and reigned twelve 
years 
and he wrought evil in the sight of the lord but not like his 
father and like his mother for he put away the image of baal that 
his father had made 
nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of jeroboam the son of 
nebat which made israel to sin he departed not therefrom 
and mesha king of moab was a sheepmaster and rendered unto the 
king of israel an hundred thousand lambs and an hundred thousand 
rams with the wool 
but it came to pass when ahab was dead that the king of moab 
rebelled against the king of israel 
and king jehoram went out of samaria the same time and numbered 
all israel 
and he went and sent to jehoshaphat the king of judah saying the 
king of moab hath rebelled against me wilt thou go with me against 
moab to battle and he said i will go up i am as thou art my people 
as thy people and my horses as thy horses 
and he said which way shall we go up and he answered the way 
through the wilderness of edom 
so the king of israel went and the king of judah and the king of 
edom and they fetched a compass of seven days journey and there was 
no water for the host and for the cattle that followed them 
and the king of israel said alas that the lord hath called 
these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of moab 
but jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the lord 
that we may enquire of the lord by him and one of the king of 
israel s servants answered and said here is elisha the son of 
shaphat which poured water on the hands of elijah 
and jehoshaphat said the word of the lord is with him so the 
king of israel and jehoshaphat and the king of edom went down to him 
and elisha said unto the king of israel what have i to do with 
thee get thee to the prophets of thy father and to the prophets of 
thy mother 
and the king of israel said unto him nay for the lord hath called 
these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of moab 
and elisha said as the lord of hosts liveth before whom i 
stand surely were it not that i regard the presence of jehoshaphat 
the king of judah i would not look toward thee nor see thee 
but now bring me a minstrel and it came to pass when the 
minstrel played that the hand of the lord came upon him 
and he said thus saith the lord make this valley full of 
ditches 
for thus saith the lord ye shall not see wind neither shall ye 
see rain yet that valley shall be filled with water that ye may 
drink both ye and your cattle and your beasts 
and this is but a light thing in the sight of the lord he will 
deliver the moabites also into your hand 
and ye shall smite every fenced city and every choice city and 
shall fell every good tree and stop all wells of water and mar every 
good piece of land with stones 
and it came to pass in the morning when the meat offering was 
offered that behold there came water by the way of edom and the 
country was filled with water 
and when all the moabites heard that the kings were come up to 
fight against them they gathered all that were able to put on armour 
and upward and stood in the border 
and they rose up early in the morning and the sun shone upon the 
water and the moabites saw the water on the other side as red as 
blood and they said this is blood the kings are surely slain 
and they have smitten one another now therefore moab to the spoil 
and when they came to the camp of israel the israelites rose up 
and smote the moabites so that they fled before them but they went 
forward smiting the moabites even in their country 
and they beat down the cities and on every good piece of land 
cast every man his stone and filled it and they stopped all the 
wells of water and felled all the good trees only in kirharaseth 
left they the stones thereof howbeit the slingers went about it and 
smote it 
and when the king of moab saw that the battle was too sore for 
him he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords to break 
through even unto the king of edom but they could not 
then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his 
stead and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall and there 
was great indignation against israel and they departed from him and 
returned to their own land 
now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the 
prophets unto elisha saying thy servant my husband is dead and thou 
knowest that thy servant did fear the lord and the creditor is come 
to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen 
and elisha said unto her what shall i do for thee tell me what 
hast thou in the house and she said thine handmaid hath not any 
thing in the house save a pot of oil 
then he said go borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy 
neighbours even empty vessels borrow not a few 
and when thou art come in thou shalt shut the door upon thee and 
upon thy sons and shalt pour out into all those vessels and thou 
shalt set aside that which is full 
so she went from him and shut the door upon her and upon her 
sons who brought the vessels to her and she poured out 
and it came to pass when the vessels were full that she said 
unto her son bring me yet a vessel and he said unto her there is 
not a vessel more and the oil stayed 
then she came and told the man of god and he said go sell the 
oil and pay thy debt and live thou and thy children of the rest 
and it fell on a day that elisha passed to shunem where was a 
great woman and she constrained him to eat bread and so it was that 
as oft as he passed by he turned in thither to eat bread 
and she said unto her husband behold now i perceive that this is 
an holy man of god which passeth by us continually 
let us make a little chamber i pray thee on the wall and let 
us set for him there a bed and a table and a stool and a 
candlestick and it shall be when he cometh to us that he shall turn 
in thither 
and it fell on a day that he came thither and he turned into 
the chamber and lay there 
and he said to gehazi his servant call this shunammite and when 
he had called her she stood before him 
and he said unto him say now unto her behold thou hast been 
careful for us with all this care what is to be done for thee 
wouldest thou be spoken for to the king or to the captain of the 
host and she answered i dwell among mine own people 
and he said what then is to be done for her and gehazi 
answered verily she hath no child and her husband is old 
and he said call her and when he had called her she stood in 
the door 
and he said about this season according to the time of life 
thou shalt embrace a son and she said nay my lord thou man of god 
do not lie unto thine handmaid 
and the woman conceived and bare a son at that season that 
elisha had said unto her according to the time of life 
and when the child was grown it fell on a day that he went out 
to his father to the reapers 
and he said unto his father my head my head and he said to a 
lad carry him to his mother 
and when he had taken him and brought him to his mother he sat 
on her knees till noon and then died 
and she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of god and 
shut the door upon him and went out 
and she called unto her husband and said send me i pray thee 
one of the young men and one of the asses that i may run to the man 
of god and come again 
and he said wherefore wilt thou go to him to day it is neither 
new moon nor sabbath and she said it shall be well 
then she saddled an ass and said to her servant drive and go 
forward slack not thy riding for me except i bid thee 
so she went and came unto the man of god to mount carmel and it 
came to pass when the man of god saw her afar off that he said to 
gehazi his servant behold yonder is that shunammite run now i 
pray thee to meet her and say unto her is it well with thee is it 
well with thy husband is it well with the child and she answered it 
is well and when she came to the man of god to the hill she 
caught him by the feet but gehazi came near to thrust her away and 
the man of god said let her alone for her soul is vexed within her 
and the lord hath hid it from me and hath not told me 
then she said did i desire a son of my lord did i not say do 
not deceive me then he said to gehazi gird up thy loins and 
take my staff in thine hand and go thy way if thou meet any man 
salute him not and if any salute thee answer him not again and lay 
my staff upon the face of the child 
and the mother of the child said as the lord liveth and as thy 
soul liveth i will not leave thee and he arose and followed her 
and gehazi passed on before them and laid the staff upon the 
face of the child but there was neither voice nor hearing wherefore 
he went again to meet him and told him saying the child is not 
awaked 
and when elisha was come into the house behold the child was 
dead and laid upon his bed 
he went in therefore and shut the door upon them twain and 
prayed unto the lord 
and he went up and lay upon the child and put his mouth upon 
his mouth and his eyes upon his eyes and his hands upon his hands 
and stretched himself upon the child and the flesh of the child waxed 
warm 
then he returned and walked in the house to and fro and went 
up and stretched himself upon him and the child sneezed seven times 
and the child opened his eyes 
and he called gehazi and said call this shunammite so he 
called her and when she was come in unto him he said take up thy 
son 
then she went in and fell at his feet and bowed herself to the 
ground and took up her son and went out 
and elisha came again to gilgal and there was a dearth in the 
land and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him and he 
said unto his servant set on the great pot and seethe pottage for 
the sons of the prophets 
and one went out into the field to gather herbs and found a wild 
vine and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full and came and 
shred them into the pot of pottage for they knew them not 
so they poured out for the men to eat and it came to pass as 
they were eating of the pottage that they cried out and said o thou 
man of god there is death in the pot and they could not eat thereof 
but he said then bring meal and he cast it into the pot and he 
said pour out for the people that they may eat and there was no 
harm in the pot 
and there came a man from baalshalisha and brought the man of 
god bread of the firstfruits twenty loaves of barley and full ears 
of corn in the husk thereof and he said give unto the people that 
they may eat 
and his servitor said what should i set this before an hundred 
men he said again give the people that they may eat for thus 
saith the lord they shall eat and shall leave thereof 
so he set it before them and they did eat and left thereof 
according to the word of the lord 
now naaman captain of the host of the king of syria was a great 
man with his master and honourable because by him the lord had given 
deliverance unto syria he was also a mighty man in valour but he was 
a leper 
and the syrians had gone out by companies and had brought away 
captive out of the land of israel a little maid and she waited on 
naaman s wife 
and she said unto her mistress would god my lord were with the 
prophet that is in samaria for he would recover him of his leprosy 
and one went in and told his lord saying thus and thus said the 
maid that is of the land of israel 
and the king of syria said go to go and i will send a letter 
unto the king of israel and he departed and took with him ten 
talents of silver and six thousand pieces of gold and ten changes of 
raiment 
and he brought the letter to the king of israel saying now when 
this letter is come unto thee behold i have therewith sent naaman my 
servant to thee that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy 
and it came to pass when the king of israel had read the letter 
that he rent his clothes and said am i god to kill and to make 
alive that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his 
leprosy wherefore consider i pray you and see how he seeketh a 
quarrel against me 
and it was so when elisha the man of god had heard that the king 
of israel had rent his clothes that he sent to the king saying 
wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes let him come now to me and he 
shall know that there is a prophet in israel 
so naaman came with his horses and with his chariot and stood at 
the door of the house of elisha 
and elisha sent a messenger unto him saying go and wash in 
jordan seven times and thy flesh shall come again to thee and thou 
shalt be clean 
but naaman was wroth and went away and said behold i thought 
he will surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the 
lord his god and strike his hand over the place and recover the 
leper 
are not abana and pharpar rivers of damascus better than all 
the waters of israel may i not wash in them and be clean so he 
turned and went away in a rage 
and his servants came near and spake unto him and said my 
father if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing wouldest thou 
not have done it how much rather then when he saith to thee wash 
and be clean then went he down and dipped himself seven times 
in jordan according to the saying of the man of god and his flesh 
came again like unto the flesh of a little child and he was clean 
and he returned to the man of god he and all his company and 
came and stood before him and he said behold now i know that there 
is no god in all the earth but in israel now therefore i pray thee 
take a blessing of thy servant 
but he said as the lord liveth before whom i stand i will 
receive none and he urged him to take it but he refused 
and naaman said shall there not then i pray thee be given to 
thy servant two mules burden of earth for thy servant will 
henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods 
but unto the lord 
in this thing the lord pardon thy servant that when my master 
goeth into the house of rimmon to worship there and he leaneth on my 
hand and i bow myself in the house of rimmon when i bow down myself 
in the house of rimmon the lord pardon thy servant in this thing 
and he said unto him go in peace so he departed from him a 
little way 
but gehazi the servant of elisha the man of god said behold 
my master hath spared naaman this syrian in not receiving at his 
hands that which he brought but as the lord liveth i will run after 
him and take somewhat of him 
so gehazi followed after naaman and when naaman saw him running 
after him he lighted down from the chariot to meet him and said is 
all well and he said all is well my master hath sent me 
saying behold even now there be come to me from mount ephraim two 
young men of the sons of the prophets give them i pray thee a 
talent of silver and two changes of garments 
and naaman said be content take two talents and he urged him 
and bound two talents of silver in two bags with two changes of 
garments and laid them upon two of his servants and they bare them 
before him 
and when he came to the tower he took them from their hand and 
bestowed them in the house and he let the men go and they departed 
but he went in and stood before his master and elisha said unto 
him whence comest thou gehazi and he said thy servant went no 
whither 
and he said unto him went not mine heart with thee when the man 
turned again from his chariot to meet thee is it a time to receive 
money and to receive garments and oliveyards and vineyards and 
sheep and oxen and menservants and maidservants the leprosy 
therefore of naaman shall cleave unto thee and unto thy seed for 
ever and he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow 
and the sons of the prophets said unto elisha behold now the 
place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us 
let us go we pray thee unto jordan and take thence every man a 
beam and let us make us a place there where we may dwell and he 
answered go ye 
and one said be content i pray thee and go with thy servants 
and he answered i will go 
so he went with them and when they came to jordan they cut down 
wood 
but as one was felling a beam the axe head fell into the water 
and he cried and said alas master for it was borrowed 
and the man of god said where fell it and he shewed him the 
place 
and he cut down a stick and cast it in thither and the iron did 
swim 
therefore said he take it up to thee and he put out his hand 
and took it 
then the king of syria warred against israel and took counsel 
with his servants saying in such and such a place shall be my camp 
and the man of god sent unto the king of israel saying beware 
that thou pass not such a place for thither the syrians are come 
down 
and the king of israel sent to the place which the man of god 
told him and warned him of and saved himself there not once nor 
twice 
therefore the heart of the king of syria was sore troubled for 
this thing and he called his servants and said unto them will ye 
not shew me which of us is for the king of israel and one of 
his servants said none my lord o king but elisha the prophet that 
is in israel telleth the king of israel the words that thou speakest 
in thy bedchamber 
and he said go and spy where he is that i may send and fetch 
him 
and it was told him saying behold he is in dothan 
therefore sent he thither horses and chariots and a great host 
and they came by night and compassed the city about 
and when the servant of the man of god was risen early and gone 
forth behold an host compassed the city both with horses and 
chariots and his servant said unto him alas my master how shall we 
do and he answered fear not for they that be with us are more 
than they that be with them 
and elisha prayed and said lord i pray thee open his eyes 
that he may see and the lord opened the eyes of the young man and he 
saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire 
round about elisha 
and when they came down to him elisha prayed unto the lord and 
said smite this people i pray thee with blindness and he smote 
them with blindness according to the word of elisha 
and elisha said unto them this is not the way neither is this 
the city follow me and i will bring you to the man whom ye seek but 
he led them to samaria 
and it came to pass when they were come into samaria that 
elisha said lord open the eyes of these men that they may see and 
the lord opened their eyes and they saw and behold they were in 
the midst of samaria 
and the king of israel said unto elisha when he saw them my 
father shall i smite them shall i smite them and he answered 
thou shalt not smite them wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast 
taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow set bread and water 
before them that they may eat and drink and go to their master 
and he prepared great provision for them and when they had eaten 
and drunk he sent them away and they went to their master so the 
bands of syria came no more into the land of israel 
and it came to pass after this that benhadad king of syria 
gathered all his host and went up and besieged samaria 
and there was a great famine in samaria and behold they 
besieged it until an ass s head was sold for fourscore pieces of 
silver and the fourth part of a cab of dove s dung for five pieces of 
silver 
and as the king of israel was passing by upon the wall there 
cried a woman unto him saying help my lord o king 
and he said if the lord do not help thee whence shall i help 
thee out of the barnfloor or out of the winepress and the 
king said unto her what aileth thee and she answered this woman 
said unto me give thy son that we may eat him to day and we will 
eat my son to morrow 
so we boiled my son and did eat him and i said unto her on the 
next day give thy son that we may eat him and she hath hid her son 
and it came to pass when the king heard the words of the woman 
that he rent his clothes and he passed by upon the wall and the 
people looked and behold he had sackcloth within upon his flesh 
then he said god do so and more also to me if the head of 
elisha the son of shaphat shall stand on him this day 
but elisha sat in his house and the elders sat with him and the 
king sent a man from before him but ere the messenger came to him he 
said to the elders see ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to 
take away mine head look when the messenger cometh shut the door 
and hold him fast at the door is not the sound of his master s feet 
behind him and while he yet talked with them behold the 
messenger came down unto him and he said behold this evil is of the 
lord what should i wait for the lord any longer then elisha 
said hear ye the word of the lord thus saith the lord to morrow 
about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel 
and two measures of barley for a shekel in the gate of samaria 
then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of god 
and said behold if the lord would make windows in heaven might this 
thing be and he said behold thou shalt see it with thine eyes but 
shalt not eat thereof 
and there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate 
and they said one to another why sit we here until we die if we 
say we will enter into the city then the famine is in the city and 
we shall die there and if we sit still here we die also now 
therefore come and let us fall unto the host of the syrians if they 
save us alive we shall live and if they kill us we shall but die 
and they rose up in the twilight to go unto the camp of the 
syrians and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of 
syria behold there was no man there 
for the lord had made the host of the syrians to hear a noise of 
chariots and a noise of horses even the noise of a great host and 
they said one to another lo the king of israel hath hired against us 
the kings of the hittites and the kings of the egyptians to come 
upon us 
wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight and left their 
tents and their horses and their asses even the camp as it was and 
fled for their life 
and when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp they 
went into one tent and did eat and drink and carried thence silver 
and gold and raiment and went and hid it and came again and 
entered into another tent and carried thence also and went and hid 
it 
then they said one to another we do not well this day is a day 
of good tidings and we hold our peace if we tarry till the morning 
light some mischief will come upon us now therefore come that we 
may go and tell the king s household 
so they came and called unto the porter of the city and they 
told them saying we came to the camp of the syrians and behold 
there was no man there neither voice of man but horses tied and 
asses tied and the tents as they were 
and he called the porters and they told it to the king s house 
within 
and the king arose in the night and said unto his servants i 
will now shew you what the syrians have done to us they know that we 
be hungry therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves 
in the field saying when they come out of the city we shall catch 
them alive and get into the city 
and one of his servants answered and said let some take i pray 
thee five of the horses that remain which are left in the city 
behold they are as all the multitude of israel that are left in it 
behold i say they are even as all the multitude of the israelites 
that are consumed and let us send and see 
they took therefore two chariot horses and the king sent after 
the host of the syrians saying go and see 
and they went after them unto jordan and lo all the way was 
full of garments and vessels which the syrians had cast away in their 
haste and the messengers returned and told the king 
and the people went out and spoiled the tents of the syrians so 
a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel and two measures of 
barley for a shekel according to the word of the lord 
and the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have 
the charge of the gate and the people trode upon him in the gate and 
he died as the man of god had said who spake when the king came down 
to him 
and it came to pass as the man of god had spoken to the king 
saying two measures of barley for a shekel and a measure of fine 
flour for a shekel shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of 
samaria and that lord answered the man of god and said now 
behold if the lord should make windows in heaven might such a thing 
be and he said behold thou shalt see it with thine eyes but shalt 
not eat thereof 
and so it fell out unto him for the people trode upon him in the 
gate and he died 
then spake elisha unto the woman whose son he had restored to 
life saying arise and go thou and thine household and sojourn 
wheresoever thou canst sojourn for the lord hath called for a famine 
and it shall also come upon the land seven years 
and the woman arose and did after the saying of the man of god 
and she went with her household and sojourned in the land of the 
philistines seven years 
and it came to pass at the seven years end that the woman 
returned out of the land of the philistines and she went forth to cry 
unto the king for her house and for her land 
and the king talked with gehazi the servant of the man of god 
saying tell me i pray thee all the great things that elisha hath 
done 
and it came to pass as he was telling the king how he had 
restored a dead body to life that behold the woman whose son he 
had restored to life cried to the king for her house and for her 
land and gehazi said my lord o king this is the woman and this is 
her son whom elisha restored to life 
and when the king asked the woman she told him so the king 
appointed unto her a certain officer saying restore all that was 
hers and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the 
land even until now 
and elisha came to damascus and benhadad the king of syria was 
sick and it was told him saying the man of god is come hither 
and the king said unto hazael take a present in thine hand and 
go meet the man of god and enquire of the lord by him saying shall 
i recover of this disease so hazael went to meet him and took a 
present with him even of every good thing of damascus forty camels 
burden and came and stood before him and said thy son benhadad king 
of syria hath sent me to thee saying shall i recover of this 
disease and elisha said unto him go say unto him thou mayest 
certainly recover howbeit the lord hath shewed me that he shall 
surely die 
and he settled his countenance stedfastly until he was ashamed 
and the man of god wept 
and hazael said why weepeth my lord and he answered because i 
know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of israel their 
strong holds wilt thou set on fire and their young men wilt thou slay 
with the sword and wilt dash their children and rip up their women 
with child 
and hazael said but what is thy servant a dog that he should 
do this great thing and elisha answered the lord hath shewed me that 
thou shalt be king over syria 
so he departed from elisha and came to his master who said to 
him what said elisha to thee and he answered he told me that thou 
shouldest surely recover 
and it came to pass on the morrow that he took a thick cloth 
and dipped it in water and spread it on his face so that he died 
and hazael reigned in his stead 
and in the fifth year of joram the son of ahab king of israel 
jehoshaphat being then king of judah jehoram the son of je hoshaphat 
king of judah began to reign 
thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign and he 
reigned eight years in jerusalem 
and he walked in the way of the kings of israel as did the house 
of ahab for the daughter of ahab was his wife and he did evil in the 
sight of the lord 
yet the lord would not destroy judah for david his servant s 
sake as he promised him to give him alway a light and to his 
children 
in his days edom revolted from under the hand of judah and made 
a king over themselves 
so joram went over to zair and all the chariots with him and he 
rose by night and smote the edomites which compassed him about and 
the captains of the chariots and the people fled into their tents 
yet edom revolted from under the hand of judah unto this day 
then libnah revolted at the same time 
and the rest of the acts of joram and all that he did are they 
not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah 
and joram slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in 
the city of david and ahaziah his son reigned in his stead 
in the twelfth year of joram the son of ahab king of israel did 
ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah begin to reign 
two and twenty years old was ahaziah when he began to reign and 
he reigned one year in jerusalem and his mother s name was athaliah 
the daughter of omri king of israel 
and he walked in the way of the house of ahab and did evil in 
the sight of the lord as did the house of ahab for he was the son in 
law of the house of ahab 
and he went with joram the son of ahab to the war against hazael 
king of syria in ramothgilead and the syrians wounded joram 
and king joram went back to be healed in jezreel of the wounds 
which the syrians had given him at ramah when he fought against 
hazael king of syria and ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah 
went down to see joram the son of ahab in jezreel because he was 
sick 
and elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets 
and said unto him gird up thy loins and take this box of oil in 
thine hand and go to ramothgilead and when thou comest thither 
look out there jehu the son of jehoshaphat the son of nimshi and go 
in and make him arise up from among his brethren and carry him to an 
inner chamber then take the box of oil and pour it on his head 
and say thus saith the lord i have anointed thee king over israel 
then open the door and flee and tarry not 
so the young man even the young man the prophet went to 
ramothgilead 
and when he came behold the captains of the host were sitting 
and he said i have an errand to thee o captain and jehu said unto 
which of all us and he said to thee o captain 
and he arose and went into the house and he poured the oil on 
his head and said unto him thus saith the lord god of israel i have 
anointed thee king over the people of the lord even over israel 
and thou shalt smite the house of ahab thy master that i may 
avenge the blood of my servants the prophets and the blood of all the 
servants of the lord at the hand of jezebel 
for the whole house of ahab shall perish and i will cut off from 
ahab him that pisseth against the wall and him that is shut up and 
left in israel and i will make the house of ahab like the house 
of jeroboam the son of nebat and like the house of baasha the son of 
ahijah and the dogs shall eat jezebel in the portion of jezreel 
and there shall be none to bury her and he opened the door and fled 
then jehu came forth to the servants of his lord and one said 
unto him is all well wherefore came this mad fellow to thee and he 
said unto them ye know the man and his communication 
and they said it is false tell us now and he said thus and 
thus spake he to me saying thus saith the lord i have anointed thee 
king over israel 
then they hasted and took every man his garment and put it 
under him on the top of the stairs and blew with trumpets saying 
jehu is king 
so jehu the son of jehoshaphat the son of nimshi conspired 
against joram now joram had kept ramothgilead he and all israel 
because of hazael king of syria 
but king joram was returned to be healed in jezreel of the wounds 
which the syrians had given him when he fought with hazael king of 
syria and jehu said if it be your minds then let none go forth 
nor escape out of the city to go to tell it in jezreel 
so jehu rode in a chariot and went to jezreel for joram lay 
there 
and ahaziah king of judah was come down to see joram 
and there stood a watchman on the tower in jezreel and he spied 
the company of jehu as he came and said i see a company and joram 
said take an horseman and send to meet them and let him say is it 
peace so there went one on horseback to meet him and said 
thus saith the king is it peace and jehu said what hast thou to do 
with peace turn thee behind me and the watchman told saying the 
messenger came to them but he cometh not again 
then he sent out a second on horseback which came to them and 
said thus saith the king is it peace and jehu answered what hast 
thou to do with peace turn thee behind me 
and the watchman told saying he came even unto them and cometh 
not again and the driving is like the driving of jehu the son of 
nimshi for he driveth furiously 
and joram said make ready and his chariot was made ready and 
joram king of israel and ahaziah king of judah went out each in his 
chariot and they went out against jehu and met him in the portion of 
naboth the jezreelite 
and it came to pass when joram saw jehu that he said is it 
peace jehu and he answered what peace so long as the whoredoms of 
thy mother jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many and joram 
turned his hands and fled and said to ahaziah there is treachery o 
ahaziah 
and jehu drew a bow with his full strength and smote jehoram 
between his arms and the arrow went out at his heart and he sunk 
down in his chariot 
then said jehu to bidkar his captain take up and cast him in 
the portion of the field of naboth the jezreelite for remember how 
that when i and thou rode together after ahab his father the lord 
laid this burden upon him surely i have seen yesterday the blood 
of naboth and the blood of his sons saith the lord and i will 
requite thee in this plat saith the lord now therefore take and cast 
him into the plat of ground according to the word of the lord 
but when ahaziah the king of judah saw this he fled by the way 
of the garden house and jehu followed after him and said smite him 
also in the chariot and they did so at the going up to gur which is 
by ibleam 
and he fled to megiddo and died there 
and his servants carried him in a chariot to jerusalem and 
buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of david 
and in the eleventh year of joram the son of ahab began ahaziah 
to reign over judah 
and when jehu was come to jezreel jezebel heard of it and she 
painted her face and tired her head and looked out at a window 
and as jehu entered in at the gate she said had zimri peace 
who slew his master and he lifted up his face to the window 
and said who is on my side who and there looked out to him two or 
three eunuchs 
and he said throw her down so they threw her down and some of 
her blood was sprinkled on the wall and on the horses and he trode 
her under foot 
and when he was come in he did eat and drink and said go see 
now this cursed woman and bury her for she is a king s daughter 
and they went to bury her but they found no more of her than the 
skull and the feet and the palms of her hands 
wherefore they came again and told him and he said this is the 
word of the lord which he spake by his servant elijah the tishbite 
saying in the portion of jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of jezebel 
and the carcase of jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the 
field in the portion of jezreel so that they shall not say this is 
jezebel 
and ahab had seventy sons in samaria and jehu wrote letters and 
sent to samaria unto the rulers of jezreel to the elders and to 
them that brought up ahab s children saying now as soon as this 
letter cometh to you seeing your master s sons are with you and 
there are with you chariots and horses a fenced city also and 
armour look even out the best and meetest of your master s sons 
and set him on his father s throne and fight for your master s house 
but they were exceedingly afraid and said behold two kings 
stood not before him how then shall we stand and he that was 
over the house and he that was over the city the elders also and 
the bringers up of the children sent to jehu saying we are thy 
servants and will do all that thou shalt bid us we will not make any 
king do thou that which is good in thine eyes 
then he wrote a letter the second time to them saying if ye be 
mine and if ye will hearken unto my voice take ye the heads of the 
men your master s sons and come to me to jezreel by to morrow this 
time now the king s sons being seventy persons were with the great 
men of the city which brought them up 
and it came to pass when the letter came to them that they took 
the king s sons and slew seventy persons and put their heads in 
baskets and sent him them to jezreel 
and there came a messenger and told him saying they have 
brought the heads of the king s sons and he said lay ye them in two 
heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning 
and it came to pass in the morning that he went out and stood 
and said to all the people ye be righteous behold i conspired 
against my master and slew him but who slew all these know 
now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the 
lord which the lord spake concerning the house of ahab for the lord 
hath done that which he spake by his servant elijah 
so jehu slew all that remained of the house of ahab in jezreel 
and all his great men and his kinsfolks and his priests until he 
left him none remaining 
and he arose and departed and came to samaria and as he was at 
the shearing house in the way jehu met with the brethren of 
ahaziah king of judah and said who are ye and they answered we are 
the brethren of ahaziah and we go down to salute the children of the 
king and the children of the queen 
and he said take them alive and they took them alive and slew 
them at the pit of the shearing house even two and forty men neither 
left he any of them 
and when he was departed thence he lighted on jehonadab the son 
of rechab coming to meet him and he saluted him and said to him is 
thine heart right as my heart is with thy heart and jehonadab 
answered it is if it be give me thine hand and he gave him his 
hand and he took him up to him into the chariot 
and he said come with me and see my zeal for the lord so they 
made him ride in his chariot 
and when he came to samaria he slew all that remained unto ahab 
in samaria till he had destroyed him according to the saying of the 
lord which he spake to elijah 
and jehu gathered all the people together and said unto them 
ahab served baal a little but jehu shall serve him much 
now therefore call unto me all the prophets of baal all his 
servants and all his priests let none be wanting for i have a great 
sacrifice to do to baal whosoever shall be wanting he shall not 
live but jehu did it in subtilty to the intent that he might destroy 
the worshippers of baal 
and jehu said proclaim a solemn assembly for baal and they 
proclaimed it 
and jehu sent through all israel and all the worshippers of 
baal came so that there was not a man left that came not and they 
came into the house of baal and the house of baal was full from one 
end to another 
and he said unto him that was over the vestry bring forth 
vestments for all the worshippers of baal and he brought them forth 
vestments 
and jehu went and jehonadab the son of rechab into the house 
of baal and said unto the worshippers of baal search and look that 
there be here with you none of the servants of the lord but the 
worshippers of baal only 
and when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings 
jehu appointed fourscore men without and said if any of the men whom 
i have brought into your hands escape he that letteth him go his 
life shall be for the life of him 
and it came to pass as soon as he had made an end of offering 
the burnt offering that jehu said to the guard and to the captains 
go in and slay them let none come forth and they smote them with 
the edge of the sword and the guard and the captains cast them out 
and went to the city of the house of baal 
and they brought forth the images out of the house of baal and 
burned them 
and they brake down the image of baal and brake down the house 
of baal and made it a draught house unto this day 
thus jehu destroyed baal out of israel 
howbeit from the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat who made 
israel to sin jehu departed not from after them to wit the golden 
calves that were in bethel and that were in dan 
and the lord said unto jehu because thou hast done well in 
executing that which is right in mine eyes and hast done unto the 
house of ahab according to all that was in mine heart thy children of 
the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of israel 
but jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the lord god of 
israel with all his heart for he departed not from the sins of 
jeroboam which made israel to sin 
in those days the lord began to cut israel short and hazael 
smote them in all the coasts of israel from jordan eastward 
all the land of gilead the gadites and the reubenites and the 
manassites from aroer which is by the river arnon even gilead and 
bashan 
now the rest of the acts of jehu and all that he did and all 
his might are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the 
kings of israel and jehu slept with his fathers and they 
buried him in samaria and jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead 
and the time that jehu reigned over israel in samaria was twenty 
and eight years 
and when athaliah the mother of ahaziah saw that her son was 
dead she arose and destroyed all the seed royal 
but jehosheba the daughter of king joram sister of ahaziah 
took joash the son of ahaziah and stole him from among the king s 
sons which were slain and they hid him even him and his nurse in 
the bedchamber from athaliah so that he was not slain 
and he was with her hid in the house of the lord six years and 
athaliah did reign over the land 
and the seventh year jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over 
hundreds with the captains and the guard and brought them to him 
into the house of the lord and made a covenant with them and took an 
oath of them in the house of the lord and shewed them the king s son 
and he commanded them saying this is the thing that ye shall 
do a third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be 
keepers of the watch of the king s house and a third part shall 
be at the gate of sur and a third part at the gate behind the guard 
so shall ye keep the watch of the house that it be not broken down 
and two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath even they 
shall keep the watch of the house of the lord about the king 
and ye shall compass the king round about every man with his 
weapons in his hand and he that cometh within the ranges let him be 
slain and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in 
and the captains over the hundreds did according to all things 
that jehoiada the priest commanded and they took every man his men 
that were to come in on the sabbath with them that should go out on 
the sabbath and came to jehoiada the priest 
and to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king 
david s spears and shields that were in the temple of the lord 
and the guard stood every man with his weapons in his hand 
round about the king from the right corner of the temple to the left 
corner of the temple along by the altar and the temple 
and he brought forth the king s son and put the crown upon him 
and gave him the testimony and they made him king and anointed him 
and they clapped their hands and said god save the king 
and when athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the 
people she came to the people into the temple of the lord 
and when she looked behold the king stood by a pillar as the 
manner was and the princes and the trumpeters by the king and all 
the people of the land rejoiced and blew with trumpets and athaliah 
rent her clothes and cried treason treason 
but jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds 
the officers of the host and said unto them have her forth without 
the ranges and him that followeth her kill with the sword for the 
priest had said let her not be slain in the house of the lord 
and they laid hands on her and she went by the way by the which 
the horses came into the king s house and there was she slain 
and jehoiada made a covenant between the lord and the king and 
the people that they should be the lord s people between the king 
also and the people 
and all the people of the land went into the house of baal and 
brake it down his altars and his images brake they in pieces 
thoroughly and slew mattan the priest of baal before the altars and 
the priest appointed officers over the house of the lord 
and he took the rulers over hundreds and the captains and the 
guard and all the people of the land and they brought down the king 
from the house of the lord and came by the way of the gate of the 
guard to the king s house and he sat on the throne of the kings 
and all the people of the land rejoiced and the city was in 
quiet and they slew athaliah with the sword beside the king s house 
seven years old was jehoash when he began to reign 
in the seventh year of jehu jehoash began to reign and forty 
years reigned he in jerusalem and his mother s name was zibiah of 
beersheba 
and jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the lord all 
his days wherein jehoiada the priest instructed him 
but the high places were not taken away the people still 
sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places 
and jehoash said to the priests all the money of the dedicated 
things that is brought into the house of the lord even the money of 
every one that passeth the account the money that every man is set 
at and all the money that cometh into any man s heart to bring into 
the house of the lord let the priests take it to them every man 
of his acquaintance and let them repair the breaches of the house 
wheresoever any breach shall be found 
but it was so that in the three and twentieth year of king 
jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house 
then king jehoash called for jehoiada the priest and the other 
priests and said unto them why repair ye not the breaches of the 
house now therefore receive no more money of your acquaintance but 
deliver it for the breaches of the house 
and the priests consented to receive no more money of the people 
neither to repair the breaches of the house 
but jehoiada the priest took a chest and bored a hole in the lid 
of it and set it beside the altar on the right side as one cometh 
into the house of the lord and the priests that kept the door put 
therein all the money that was brought into the house of the lord 
and it was so when they saw that there was much money in the 
chest that the king s scribe and the high priest came up and they 
put up in bags and told the money that was found in the house of the 
lord 
and they gave the money being told into the hands of them that 
did the work that had the oversight of the house of the lord and 
they laid it out to the carpenters and builders that wrought upon the 
house of the lord and to masons and hewers of stone and to 
buy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the 
lord and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it 
howbeit there were not made for the house of the lord bowls of 
silver snuffers basons trumpets any vessels of gold or vessels of 
silver of the money that was brought into the house of the lord 
but they gave that to the workmen and repaired therewith the 
house of the lord 
moreover they reckoned not with the men into whose hand they 
delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen for they dealt 
faithfully 
the trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house 
of the lord it was the priests 
then hazael king of syria went up and fought against gath and 
took it and hazael set his face to go up to jerusalem 
and jehoash king of judah took all the hallowed things that 
jehoshaphat and jehoram and ahaziah his fathers kings of judah 
had dedicated and his own hallowed things and all the gold that was 
found in the treasures of the house of the lord and in the king s 
house and sent it to hazael king of syria and he went away from 
jerusalem 
and the rest of the acts of joash and all that he did are they 
not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah 
and his servants arose and made a conspiracy and slew joash in 
the house of millo which goeth down to silla 
for jozachar the son of shimeath and jehozabad the son of 
shomer his servants smote him and he died and they buried him with 
his fathers in the city of david and amaziah his son reigned in his 
stead 
in the three and twentieth year of joash the son of ahaziah king 
of judah jehoahaz the son of jehu began to reign over israel in 
samaria and reigned seventeen years 
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord and 
followed the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat which made israel to 
sin he departed not therefrom 
and the anger of the lord was kindled against israel and he 
delivered them into the hand of hazael king of syria and into the 
hand of benhadad the son of hazael all their days 
and jehoahaz besought the lord and the lord hearkened unto him 
for he saw the oppression of israel because the king of syria 
oppressed them 
and the lord gave israel a saviour so that they went out from 
under the hand of the syrians and the children of israel dwelt in 
their tents as beforetime 
nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of 
jeroboam who made israel sin but walked therein and there remained 
the grove also in samaria neither did he leave of the people 
to jehoahaz but fifty horsemen and ten chariots and ten thousand 
footmen for the king of syria had destroyed them and had made them 
like the dust by threshing 
now the rest of the acts of jehoahaz and all that he did and 
his might are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the 
kings of israel and jehoahaz slept with his fathers and they 
buried him in samaria and joash his son reigned in his stead 
in the thirty and seventh year of joash king of judah began 
jehoash the son of jehoahaz to reign over israel in samaria and 
reigned sixteen years 
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord he 
departed not from all the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat who made 
israel sin but he walked therein 
and the rest of the acts of joash and all that he did and his 
might wherewith he fought against amaziah king of judah are they not 
written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel 
and joash slept with his fathers and jeroboam sat upon his throne 
and joash was buried in samaria with the kings of israel 
now elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died and 
joash the king of israel came down unto him and wept over his face 
and said o my father my father the chariot of israel and the 
horsemen thereof 
and elisha said unto him take bow and arrows and he took unto 
him bow and arrows 
and he said to the king of israel put thine hand upon the bow 
and he put his hand upon it and elisha put his hands upon the king s 
hands 
and he said open the window eastward and he opened it then 
elisha said shoot and he shot and he said the arrow of the lord s 
deliverance and the arrow of deliverance from syria for thou shalt 
smite the syrians in aphek till thou have consumed them 
and he said take the arrows and he took them and he said unto 
the king of israel smite upon the ground and he smote thrice and 
stayed 
and the man of god was wroth with him and said thou shouldest 
have smitten five or six times then hadst thou smitten syria till 
thou hadst consumed it whereas now thou shalt smite syria but thrice 
and elisha died and they buried him and the bands of the 
moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year 
and it came to pass as they were burying a man that behold 
they spied a band of men and they cast the man into the sepulchre of 
elisha and when the man was let down and touched the bones of 
elisha he revived and stood up on his feet 
but hazael king of syria oppressed israel all the days of 
jehoahaz 
and the lord was gracious unto them and had compassion on them 
and had respect unto them because of his covenant with abraham 
isaac and jacob and would not destroy them neither cast he them 
from his presence as yet 
so hazael king of syria died and benhadad his son reigned in 
his stead 
and jehoash the son of jehoahaz took again out of the hand of 
benhadad the son of hazael the cities which he had taken out of the 
hand of jehoahaz his father by war three times did joash beat him 
and recovered the cities of israel 
in the second year of joash son of jehoahaz king of israel 
reigned amaziah the son of joash king of judah 
he was twenty and five years old when he began to reign and 
reigned twenty and nine years in jerusalem and his mother s name was 
jehoaddan of jerusalem 
and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord yet not 
like david his father he did according to all things as joash his 
father did 
howbeit the high places were not taken away as yet the people 
did sacrifice and burnt incense on the high places 
and it came to pass as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his 
hand that he slew his servants which had slain the king his father 
but the children of the murderers he slew not according unto 
that which is written in the book of the law of moses wherein the 
lord commanded saying the fathers shall not be put to death for the 
children nor the children be put to death for the fathers but every 
man shall be put to death for his own sin 
he slew of edom in the valley of salt ten thousand and took 
selah by war and called the name of it joktheel unto this day 
then amaziah sent messengers to jehoash the son of jehoahaz son 
of jehu king of israel saying come let us look one another in the 
face 
and jehoash the king of israel sent to amaziah king of judah 
saying the thistle that was in lebanon sent to the cedar that was in 
lebanon saying give thy daughter to my son to wife and there passed 
by a wild beast that was in lebanon and trode down the thistle 
thou hast indeed smitten edom and thine heart hath lifted thee 
up glory of this and tarry at home for why shouldest thou meddle to 
thy hurt that thou shouldest fall even thou and judah with thee 
but amaziah would not hear therefore jehoash king of israel 
went up and he and amaziah king of judah looked one another in the 
face at bethshemesh which belongeth to judah 
and judah was put to the worse before israel and they fled 
every man to their tents 
and jehoash king of israel took amaziah king of judah the son 
of jehoash the son of ahaziah at bethshemesh and came to jerusalem 
and brake down the wall of jerusalem from the gate of ephraim unto the 
corner gate four hundred cubits 
and he took all the gold and silver and all the vessels that 
were found in the house of the lord and in the treasures of the 
king s house and hostages and returned to samaria 
now the rest of the acts of jehoash which he did and his might 
and how he fought with amaziah king of judah are they not written in 
the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel and jehoash 
slept with his fathers and was buried in samaria with the kings of 
israel and jeroboam his son reigned in his stead 
and amaziah the son of joash king of judah lived after the death 
of jehoash son of jehoahaz king of israel fifteen years 
and the rest of the acts of amaziah are they not written in the 
book of the chronicles of the kings of judah now they made a 
conspiracy against him in jerusalem and he fled to lachish but they 
sent after him to lachish and slew him there 
and they brought him on horses and he was buried at jerusalem 
with his fathers in the city of david 
and all the people of judah took azariah which was sixteen 
years old and made him king instead of his father amaziah 
he built elath and restored it to judah after that the king 
slept with his fathers 
in the fifteenth year of amaziah the son of joash king of judah 
jeroboam the son of joash king of israel began to reign in samaria 
and reigned forty and one years 
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord he 
departed not from all the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat who made 
israel to sin 
he restored the coast of israel from the entering of hamath unto 
the sea of the plain according to the word of the lord god of israel 
which he spake by the hand of his servant jonah the son of amittai 
the prophet which was of gathhepher 
for the lord saw the affliction of israel that it was very 
bitter for there was not any shut up nor any left nor any helper 
for israel 
and the lord said not that he would blot out the name of israel 
from under heaven but he saved them by the hand of jeroboam the son 
of joash 
now the rest of the acts of jeroboam and all that he did and 
his might how he warred and how he recovered damascus and hamath 
which belonged to judah for israel are they not written in the book 
of the chronicles of the kings of israel and jeroboam slept 
with his fathers even with the kings of israel and zachariah his son 
reigned in his stead 
in the twenty and seventh year of jeroboam king of israel began 
azariah son of amaziah king of judah to reign 
sixteen years old was he when he began to reign and he reigned 
two and fifty years in jerusalem and his mother s name was jecholiah 
of jerusalem 
and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord 
according to all that his father amaziah had done save that the 
high places were not removed the people sacrificed and burnt incense 
still on the high places 
and the lord smote the king so that he was a leper unto the day 
of his death and dwelt in a several house and jotham the king s son 
was over the house judging the people of the land 
and the rest of the acts of azariah and all that he did are 
they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah 
so azariah slept with his fathers and they buried him with his 
fathers in the city of david and jotham his son reigned in his stead 
in the thirty and eighth year of azariah king of judah did 
zachariah the son of jeroboam reign over israel in samaria six months 
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord as his 
fathers had done he departed not from the sins of jeroboam the son of 
nebat who made israel to sin 
and shallum the son of jabesh conspired against him and smote 
him before the people and slew him and reigned in his stead 
and the rest of the acts of zachariah behold they are written 
in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel 
this was the word of the lord which he spake unto jehu saying 
thy sons shall sit on the throne of israel unto the fourth generation 
and so it came to pass 
shallum the son of jabesh began to reign in the nine and 
thirtieth year of uzziah king of judah and he reigned a full month in 
samaria 
for menahem the son of gadi went up from tirzah and came to 
samaria and smote shallum the son of jabesh in samaria and slew him 
and reigned in his stead 
and the rest of the acts of shallum and his conspiracy which he 
made behold they are written in the book of the chronicles of the 
kings of israel 
then menahem smote tiphsah and all that were therein and the 
coasts thereof from tirzah because they opened not to him therefore 
he smote it and all the women therein that were with child he ripped 
up 
in the nine and thirtieth year of azariah king of judah began 
menahem the son of gadi to reign over israel and reigned ten years in 
samaria 
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord he 
departed not all his days from the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat 
who made israel to sin 
and pul the king of assyria came against the land and menahem 
gave pul a thousand talents of silver that his hand might be with him 
to confirm the kingdom in his hand 
and menahem exacted the money of israel even of all the mighty 
men of wealth of each man fifty shekels of silver to give to the 
king of assyria so the king of assyria turned back and stayed not 
there in the land 
and the rest of the acts of menahem and all that he did are 
they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel 
and menahem slept with his fathers and pekahiah his son reigned 
in his stead 
in the fiftieth year of azariah king of judah pekahiah the son 
of menahem began to reign over israel in samaria and reigned two 
years 
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord he 
departed not from the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat who made 
israel to sin 
but pekah the son of remaliah a captain of his conspired 
against him and smote him in samaria in the palace of the king s 
house with argob and arieh and with him fifty men of the gileadites 
and he killed him and reigned in his room 
and the rest of the acts of pekahiah and all that he did 
behold they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of 
israel 
in the two and fiftieth year of azariah king of judah pekah the 
son of remaliah began to reign over israel in samaria and reigned 
twenty years 
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord he 
departed not from the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat who made 
israel to sin 
in the days of pekah king of israel came tiglathpileser king of 
assyria and took ijon and abelbethmaachah and janoah and kedesh 
and hazor and gilead and galilee all the land of naphtali and 
carried them captive to assyria 
and hoshea the son of elah made a conspiracy against pekah the 
son of remaliah and smote him and slew him and reigned in his 
stead in the twentieth year of jotham the son of uzziah 
and the rest of the acts of pekah and all that he did behold 
they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel 
in the second year of pekah the son of remaliah king of israel 
began jotham the son of uzziah king of judah to reign 
five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign and he 
reigned sixteen years in jerusalem and his mother s name was jerusha 
the daughter of zadok 
and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord he did 
according to all that his father uzziah had done 
howbeit the high places were not removed the people sacrificed 
and burned incense still in the high places he built the higher gate 
of the house of the lord 
now the rest of the acts of jotham and all that he did are 
they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah 
in those days the lord began to send against judah rezin the 
king of syria and pekah the son of remaliah 
and jotham slept with his fathers and was buried with his 
fathers in the city of david his father and ahaz his son reigned in 
his stead 
in the seventeenth year of pekah the son of remaliah ahaz the son 
of jotham king of judah began to reign 
twenty years old was ahaz when he began to reign and reigned 
sixteen years in jerusalem and did not that which was right in the 
sight of the lord his god like david his father 
but he walked in the way of the kings of israel yea and made 
his son to pass through the fire according to the abominations of the 
heathen whom the lord cast out from before the children of israel 
and he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places and on 
the hills and under every green tree 
then rezin king of syria and pekah son of remaliah king of israel 
came up to jerusalem to war and they besieged ahaz but could not 
overcome him 
at that time rezin king of syria recovered elath to syria and 
drave the jews from elath and the syrians came to elath and dwelt 
there unto this day 
so ahaz sent messengers to tiglathpileser king of assyria 
saying i am thy servant and thy son come up and save me out of the 
hand of the king of syria and out of the hand of the king of israel 
which rise up against me 
and ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of 
the lord and in the treasures of the king s house and sent it for a 
present to the king of assyria 
and the king of assyria hearkened unto him for the king of 
assyria went up against damascus and took it and carried the people 
of it captive to kir and slew rezin 
and king ahaz went to damascus to meet tiglathpileser king of 
assyria and saw an altar that was at damascus and king ahaz sent to 
urijah the priest the fashion of the altar and the pattern of it 
according to all the workmanship thereof 
and urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king 
ahaz had sent from damascus so urijah the priest made it against king 
ahaz came from damascus 
and when the king was come from damascus the king saw the 
altar and the king approached to the altar and offered thereon 
and he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering and 
poured his drink offering and sprinkled the blood of his peace 
offerings upon the altar 
and he brought also the brasen altar which was before the lord 
from the forefront of the house from between the altar and the house 
of the lord and put it on the north side of the altar 
and king ahaz commanded urijah the priest saying upon the 
great altar burn the morning burnt offering and the evening meat 
offering and the king s burnt sacrifice and his meat offering with 
the burnt offering of all the people of the land and their meat 
offering and their drink offerings and sprinkle upon it all the 
blood of the burnt offering and all the blood of the sacrifice and 
the brasen altar shall be for me to enquire by 
thus did urijah the priest according to all that king ahaz 
commanded 
and king ahaz cut off the borders of the bases and removed the 
laver from off them and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen 
that were under it and put it upon the pavement of stones 
and the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house 
and the king s entry without turned he from the house of the lord for 
the king of assyria 
now the rest of the acts of ahaz which he did are they not 
written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah 
and ahaz slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in 
the city of david and hezekiah his son reigned in his stead 
in the twelfth year of ahaz king of judah began hoshea the son of 
elah to reign in samaria over israel nine years 
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord but not 
as the kings of israel that were before him 
against him came up shalmaneser king of assyria and hoshea 
became his servant and gave him presents 
and the king of assyria found conspiracy in hoshea for he had 
sent messengers to so king of egypt and brought no present to the 
king of assyria as he had done year by year therefore the king of 
assyria shut him up and bound him in prison 
then the king of assyria came up throughout all the land and 
went up to samaria and besieged it three years 
in the ninth year of hoshea the king of assyria took samaria and 
carried israel away into assyria and placed them in halah and in 
habor by the river of gozan and in the cities of the medes 
for so it was that the children of israel had sinned against the 
lord their god which had brought them up out of the land of egypt 
from under the hand of pharaoh king of egypt and had feared other 
gods and walked in the statutes of the heathen whom the lord 
cast out from before the children of israel and of the kings of 
israel which they had made 
and the children of israel did secretly those things that were 
not right against the lord their god and they built them high places 
in all their cities from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced 
city 
and they set them up images and groves in every high hill and 
under every green tree and there they burnt incense in all the 
high places as did the heathen whom the lord carried away before 
them and wrought wicked things to provoke the lord to anger 
for they served idols whereof the lord had said unto them ye shall 
not do this thing 
yet the lord testified against israel and against judah by all 
the prophets and by all the seers saying turn ye from your evil 
ways and keep my commandments and my statutes according to all the 
law which i commanded your fathers and which i sent to you by my 
servants the prophets 
notwithstanding they would not hear but hardened their necks 
like to the neck of their fathers that did not believe in the lord 
their god 
and they rejected his statutes and his covenant that he made 
with their fathers and his testimonies which he testified against 
them and they followed vanity and became vain and went after the 
heathen that were round about them concerning whom the lord had 
charged them that they should not do like them 
and they left all the commandments of the lord their god and 
made them molten images even two calves and made a grove and 
worshipped all the host of heaven and served baal 
and they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through 
the fire and used divination and enchantments and sold themselves to 
do evil in the sight of the lord to provoke him to anger 
therefore the lord was very angry with israel and removed them 
out of his sight there was none left but the tribe of judah only 
also judah kept not the commandments of the lord their god but 
walked in the statutes of israel which they made 
and the lord rejected all the seed of israel and afflicted 
them and delivered them into the hand of spoilers until he had cast 
them out of his sight 
for he rent israel from the house of david and they made 
jeroboam the son of nebat king and jeroboam drave israel from 
following the lord and made them sin a great sin 
for the children of israel walked in all the sins of jeroboam 
which he did they departed not from them until the lord 
removed israel out of his sight as he had said by all his servants 
the prophets so was israel carried away out of their own land to 
assyria unto this day 
and the king of assyria brought men from babylon and from 
cuthah and from ava and from hamath and from sepharvaim and placed 
them in the cities of samaria instead of the children of israel and 
they possessed samaria and dwelt in the cities thereof 
and so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there that 
they feared not the lord therefore the lord sent lions among them 
which slew some of them 
wherefore they spake to the king of assyria saying the nations 
which thou hast removed and placed in the cities of samaria know not 
the manner of the god of the land therefore he hath sent lions among 
them and behold they slay them because they know not the manner of 
the god of the land 
then the king of assyria commanded saying carry thither one of 
the priests whom ye brought from thence and let them go and dwell 
there and let him teach them the manner of the god of the land 
then one of the priests whom they had carried away from samaria 
came and dwelt in bethel and taught them how they should fear the 
lord 
howbeit every nation made gods of their own and put them in the 
houses of the high places which the samaritans had made every nation 
in their cities wherein they dwelt 
and the men of babylon made succothbenoth and the men of cuth 
made nergal and the men of hamath made ashima and the avites 
made nibhaz and tartak and the sepharvites burnt their children in 
fire to adrammelech and anammelech the gods of sepharvaim 
so they feared the lord and made unto themselves of the lowest 
of them priests of the high places which sacrificed for them in the 
houses of the high places 
they feared the lord and served their own gods after the 
manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence 
unto this day they do after the former manners they fear not 
the lord neither do they after their statutes or after their 
ordinances or after the law and commandment which the lord commanded 
the children of jacob whom he named israel with whom the lord 
had made a covenant and charged them saying ye shall not fear other 
gods nor bow yourselves to them nor serve them nor sacrifice to 
them but the lord who brought you up out of the land of egypt 
with great power and a stretched out arm him shall ye fear and him 
shall ye worship and to him shall ye do sacrifice 
and the statutes and the ordinances and the law and the 
commandment which he wrote for you ye shall observe to do for 
evermore and ye shall not fear other gods 
and the covenant that i have made with you ye shall not forget 
neither shall ye fear other gods 
but the lord your god ye shall fear and he shall deliver you 
out of the hand of all your enemies 
howbeit they did not hearken but they did after their former 
manner 
so these nations feared the lord and served their graven 
images both their children and their children s children as did 
their fathers so do they unto this day 
now it came to pass in the third year of hoshea son of elah king 
of israel that hezekiah the son of ahaz king of judah began to reign 
twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign and he 
reigned twenty and nine years in jerusalem his mother s name also was 
abi the daughter of zachariah 
and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord 
according to all that david his father did 
he removed the high places and brake the images and cut down 
the groves and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that moses had 
made for unto those days the children of israel did burn incense to 
it and he called it nehushtan 
he trusted in the lord god of israel so that after him was none 
like him among all the kings of judah nor any that were before him 
for he clave to the lord and departed not from following him 
but kept his commandments which the lord commanded moses 
and the lord was with him and he prospered whithersoever he went 
forth and he rebelled against the king of assyria and served him 
not 
he smote the philistines even unto gaza and the borders 
thereof from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city 
and it came to pass in the fourth year of king hezekiah which 
was the seventh year of hoshea son of elah king of israel that 
shalmaneser king of assyria came up against samaria and besieged it 
and at the end of three years they took it even in the sixth 
year of hezekiah that is in the ninth year of hoshea king of israel 
samaria was taken 
and the king of assyria did carry away israel unto assyria and 
put them in halah and in habor by the river of gozan and in the 
cities of the medes because they obeyed not the voice of the 
lord their god but transgressed his covenant and all that moses the 
servant of the lord commanded and would not hear them nor do them 
now in the fourteenth year of king hezekiah did sennacherib king 
of assyria come up against all the fenced cities of judah and took 
them 
and hezekiah king of judah sent to the king of assyria to 
lachish saying i have offended return from me that which thou 
puttest on me will i bear and the king of assyria appointed unto 
hezekiah king of judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty 
talents of gold 
and hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house 
of the lord and in the treasures of the king s house 
at that time did hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the 
temple of the lord and from the pillars which hezekiah king of judah 
had overlaid and gave it to the king of assyria 
and the king of assyria sent tartan and rabsaris and rabshakeh 
from lachish to king hezekiah with a great host against jerusalem and 
they went up and came to jerusalem and when they were come up they 
came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool which is in the 
highway of the fuller s field 
and when they had called to the king there came out to them 
eliakim the son of hilkiah which was over the household and shebna 
the scribe and joah the son of asaph the recorder 
and rabshakeh said unto them speak ye now to hezekiah thus 
saith the great king the king of assyria what confidence is this 
wherein thou trustest thou sayest but they are but vain 
words i have counsel and strength for the war now on whom dost thou 
trust that thou rebellest against me now behold thou 
trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed even upon egypt on 
which if a man lean it will go into his hand and pierce it so is 
pharaoh king of egypt unto all that trust on him 
but if ye say unto me we trust in the lord our god is not that 
he whose high places and whose altars hezekiah hath taken away and 
hath said to judah and jerusalem ye shall worship before this altar 
in jerusalem now therefore i pray thee give pledges to my 
lord the king of assyria and i will deliver thee two thousand horses 
if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them 
how then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the 
least of my master s servants and put thy trust on egypt for chariots 
and for horsemen am i now come up without the lord against 
this place to destroy it the lord said to me go up against this 
land and destroy it 
then said eliakim the son of hilkiah and shebna and joah unto 
rabshakeh speak i pray thee to thy servants in the syrian language 
for we understand it and talk not with us in the jews language in 
the ears of the people that are on the wall 
but rabshakeh said unto them hath my master sent me to thy 
master and to thee to speak these words hath he not sent me to the 
men which sit on the wall that they may eat their own dung and drink 
their own piss with you then rabshakeh stood and cried with a 
loud voice in the jews language and spake saying hear the word of 
the great king the king of assyria thus saith the king let 
not hezekiah deceive you for he shall not be able to deliver you out 
of his hand neither let hezekiah make you trust in the lord 
saying the lord will surely deliver us and this city shall not be 
delivered into the hand of the king of assyria 
hearken not to hezekiah for thus saith the king of assyria 
make an agreement with me by a present and come out to me and then 
eat ye every man of his own vine and every one of his fig tree and 
drink ye every one the waters of his cistern until i come and 
take you away to a land like your own land a land of corn and wine a 
land of bread and vineyards a land of oil olive and of honey that ye 
may live and not die and hearken not unto hezekiah when he 
persuadeth you saying the lord will deliver us 
hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land 
out of the hand of the king of assyria where are the gods of 
hamath and of arpad where are the gods of sepharvaim hena and 
ivah have they delivered samaria out of mine hand who are 
they among all the gods of the countries that have delivered their 
country out of mine hand that the lord should deliver jerusalem out 
of mine hand but the people held their peace and answered him 
not a word for the king s commandment was saying answer him not 
then came eliakim the son of hilkiah which was over the 
household and shebna the scribe and joah the son of asaph the 
recorder to hezekiah with their clothes rent and told him the words 
of rabshakeh 
and it came to pass when king hezekiah heard it that he rent 
his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the 
house of the lord 
and he sent eliakim which was over the household and shebna the 
scribe and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth to 
isaiah the prophet the son of amoz 
and they said unto him thus saith hezekiah this day is a day of 
trouble and of rebuke and blasphemy for the children are come to 
the birth and there is not strength to bring forth 
it may be the lord thy god will hear all the words of rabshakeh 
whom the king of assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living 
god and will reprove the words which the lord thy god hath heard 
wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that are left 
so the servants of king hezekiah came to isaiah 
and isaiah said unto them thus shall ye say to your master thus 
saith the lord be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard with 
which the servants of the king of assyria have blasphemed me 
behold i will send a blast upon him and he shall hear a rumour 
and shall return to his own land and i will cause him to fall by the 
sword in his own land 
so rabshakeh returned and found the king of assyria warring 
against libnah for he had heard that he was departed from lachish 
and when he heard say of tirhakah king of ethiopia behold he is 
come out to fight against thee he sent messengers again unto 
hezekiah saying thus shall ye speak to hezekiah king of judah 
saying let not thy god in whom thou trustest deceive thee saying 
jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of assyria 
behold thou hast heard what the kings of assyria have done to 
all lands by destroying them utterly and shalt thou be delivered 
have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers 
have destroyed as gozan and haran and rezeph and the children of 
eden which were in thelasar where is the king of hamath and 
the king of arpad and the king of the city of sepharvaim of hena 
and ivah and hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the 
messengers and read it and hezekiah went up into the house of the 
lord and spread it before the lord 
and hezekiah prayed before the lord and said o lord god of 
israel which dwellest between the cherubims thou art the god even 
thou alone of all the kingdoms of the earth thou hast made heaven 
and earth 
lord bow down thine ear and hear open lord thine eyes and 
see and hear the words of sennacherib which hath sent him to 
reproach the living god 
of a truth lord the kings of assyria have destroyed the 
nations and their lands and have cast their gods into the fire 
for they were no gods but the work of men s hands wood and stone 
therefore they have destroyed them 
now therefore o lord our god i beseech thee save thou us out 
of his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art 
the lord god even thou only 
then isaiah the son of amoz sent to hezekiah saying thus saith 
the lord god of israel that which thou hast prayed to me against 
sennacherib king of assyria i have heard 
this is the word that the lord hath spoken concerning him the 
virgin the daughter of zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to 
scorn the daughter of jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee 
whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed and against whom hast 
thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high even against 
the holy one of israel 
by thy messengers thou hast reproached the lord and hast said 
with the multitude of my chariots i am come up to the height of the 
mountains to the sides of lebanon and will cut down the tall cedar 
trees thereof and the choice fir trees thereof and i will enter into 
the lodgings of his borders and into the forest of his carmel 
i have digged and drunk strange waters and with the sole of my 
feet have i dried up all the rivers of besieged places 
hast thou not heard long ago how i have done it and of ancient 
times that i have formed it now have i brought it to pass that thou 
shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps 
therefore their inhabitants were of small power they were 
dismayed and confounded they were as the grass of the field and as 
the green herb as the grass on the house tops and as corn blasted 
before it be grown up 
but i know thy abode and thy going out and thy coming in and 
thy rage against me 
because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine 
ears therefore i will put my hook in thy nose and my bridle in thy 
lips and i will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest 
and this shall be a sign unto thee ye shall eat this year such 
things as grow of themselves and in the second year that which 
springeth of the same and in the third year sow ye and reap and 
plant vineyards and eat the fruits thereof 
and the remnant that is escaped of the house of judah shall yet 
again take root downward and bear fruit upward 
for out of jerusalem shall go forth a remnant and they that 
escape out of mount zion the zeal of the lord of hosts shall do this 
therefore thus saith the lord concerning the king of assyria he 
shall not come into this city nor shoot an arrow there nor come 
before it with shield nor cast a bank against it 
by the way that he came by the same shall he return and shall 
not come into this city saith the lord 
for i will defend this city to save it for mine own sake and 
for my servant david s sake 
and it came to pass that night that the angel of the lord went 
out and smote in the camp of the assyrians an hundred fourscore and 
five thousand and when they arose early in the morning behold they 
were all dead corpses 
so sennacherib king of assyria departed and went and returned 
and dwelt at nineveh 
and it came to pass as he was worshipping in the house of 
nisroch his god that adrammelech and sharezer his sons smote him with 
the sword and they escaped into the land of armenia and esarhaddon 
his son reigned in his stead 
in those days was hezekiah sick unto death and the prophet 
isaiah the son of amoz came to him and said unto him thus saith the 
lord set thine house in order for thou shalt die and not live 
then he turned his face to the wall and prayed unto the lord 
saying i beseech thee o lord remember now how i have walked 
before thee in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that 
which is good in thy sight and hezekiah wept sore 
and it came to pass afore isaiah was gone out into the middle 
court that the word of the lord came to him saying turn again 
and tell hezekiah the captain of my people thus saith the lord the 
god of david thy father i have heard thy prayer i have seen thy 
tears behold i will heal thee on the third day thou shalt go up 
unto the house of the lord 
and i will add unto thy days fifteen years and i will deliver 
thee and this city out of the hand of the king of assyria and i will 
defend this city for mine own sake and for my servant david s sake 
and isaiah said take a lump of figs and they took and laid it 
on the boil and he recovered 
and hezekiah said unto isaiah what shall be the sign that the 
lord will heal me and that i shall go up into the house of the lord 
the third day and isaiah said this sign shalt thou have of the 
lord that the lord will do the thing that he hath spoken shall the 
shadow go forward ten degrees or go back ten degrees and 
hezekiah answered it is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten 
degrees nay but let the shadow return backward ten degrees 
and isaiah the prophet cried unto the lord and he brought the 
shadow ten degrees backward by which it had gone down in the dial of 
ahaz 
at that time berodachbaladan the son of baladan king of 
babylon sent letters and a present unto hezekiah for he had heard 
that hezekiah had been sick 
and hezekiah hearkened unto them and shewed them all the house 
of his precious things the silver and the gold and the spices and 
the precious ointment and all the house of his armour and all that 
was found in his treasures there was nothing in his house nor in all 
his dominion that hezekiah shewed them not 
then came isaiah the prophet unto king hezekiah and said unto 
him what said these men and from whence came they unto thee and 
hezekiah said they are come from a far country even from babylon 
and he said what have they seen in thine house and hezekiah 
answered all the things that are in mine house have they seen there 
is nothing among my treasures that i have not shewed them 
and isaiah said unto hezekiah hear the word of the lord 
behold the days come that all that is in thine house and that 
which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day shall be 
carried into babylon nothing shall be left saith the lord 
and of thy sons that shall issue from thee which thou shalt 
beget shall they take away and they shall be eunuchs in the palace 
of the king of babylon 
then said hezekiah unto isaiah good is the word of the lord 
which thou hast spoken and he said is it not good if peace and 
truth be in my days and the rest of the acts of hezekiah and 
all his might and how he made a pool and a conduit and brought 
water into the city are they not written in the book of the 
chronicles of the kings of judah and hezekiah slept with his 
fathers and manasseh his son reigned in his stead 
manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign and reigned 
fifty and five years in jerusalem and his mother s name was 
hephzibah 
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord after 
the abominations of the heathen whom the lord cast out before the 
children of israel 
for he built up again the high places which hezekiah his father 
had destroyed and he reared up altars for baal and made a grove as 
did ahab king of israel and worshipped all the host of heaven and 
served them 
and he built altars in the house of the lord of which the lord 
said in jerusalem will i put my name 
and he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts 
of the house of the lord 
and he made his son pass through the fire and observed times 
and used enchantments and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards he 
wrought much wickedness in the sight of the lord to provoke him to 
anger 
and he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the 
house of which the lord said to david and to solomon his son in 
this house and in jerusalem which i have chosen out of all tribes of 
israel will i put my name for ever neither will i make the feet 
of israel move any more out of the land which i gave their fathers 
only if they will observe to do according to all that i have commanded 
them and according to all the law that my servant moses commanded 
them 
but they hearkened not and manasseh seduced them to do more evil 
than did the nations whom the lord destroyed before the children of 
israel 
and the lord spake by his servants the prophets saying 
because manasseh king of judah hath done these abominations and hath 
done wickedly above all that the amorites did which were before him 
and hath made judah also to sin with his idols therefore thus 
saith the lord god of israel behold i am bringing such evil upon 
jerusalem and judah that whosoever heareth of it both his ears shall 
tingle 
and i will stretch over jerusalem the line of samaria and the 
plummet of the house of ahab and i will wipe jerusalem as a man 
wipeth a dish wiping it and turning it upside down 
and i will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance and deliver 
them into the hand of their enemies and they shall become a prey and 
a spoil to all their enemies because they have done that which 
was evil in my sight and have provoked me to anger since the day 
their fathers came forth out of egypt even unto this day 
moreover manasseh she would innocent blood very much till he had 
filled jerusalem from one end to another beside his sin wherewith he 
made judah to sin in doing that which was evil in the sight of the 
lord 
now the rest of the acts of manasseh and all that he did and 
his sin that he sinned are they not written in the book of the 
chronicles of the kings of judah and manasseh slept with his 
fathers and was buried in the garden of his own house in the garden 
of uzza and amon his son reigned in his stead 
amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign and he 
reigned two years in jerusalem and his mother s name was 
meshullemeth the daughter of haruz of jotbah 
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord as his 
father manasseh did 
and he walked in all the way that his father walked in and 
served the idols that his father served and worshipped them 
and he forsook the lord god of his fathers and walked not in the way 
of the lord 
and the servants of amon conspired against him and slew the 
king in his own house 
and the people of the land slew all them that had conspired 
against king amon and the people of the land made josiah his son king 
in his stead 
now the rest of the acts of amon which he did are they not 
written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah 
and he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of uzza and josiah 
his son reigned in his stead 
josiah was eight years old when he began to reign and he reigned 
thirty and one years in jerusalem and his mother s name was jedidah 
the daughter of adaiah of boscath 
and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord and 
walked in all the way of david his father and turned not aside to the 
right hand or to the left 
and it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king josiah that 
the king sent shaphan the son of azaliah the son of meshullam the 
scribe to the house of the lord saying go up to hilkiah the 
high priest that he may sum the silver which is brought into the 
house of the lord which the keepers of the door have gathered of the 
people and let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the 
work that have the oversight of the house of the lord and let them 
give it to the doers of the work which is in the house of the lord to 
repair the breaches of the house unto carpenters and builders 
and masons and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house 
howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that 
was delivered into their hand because they dealt faithfully 
and hilkiah the high priest said unto shaphan the scribe i have 
found the book of the law in the house of the lord and hilkiah gave 
the book to shaphan and he read it 
and shaphan the scribe came to the king and brought the king 
word again and said thy servants have gathered the money that was 
found in the house and have delivered it into the hand of them that 
do the work that have the oversight of the house of the lord 
and shaphan the scribe shewed the king saying hilkiah the 
priest hath delivered me a book and shaphan read it before the king 
and it came to pass when the king had heard the words of the 
book of the law that he rent his clothes 
and the king commanded hilkiah the priest and ahikam the son of 
shaphan and achbor the son of michaiah and shaphan the scribe and 
asahiah a servant of the king s saying go ye enquire of the 
lord for me and for the people and for all judah concerning the 
words of this book that is found for great is the wrath of the lord 
that is kindled against us because our fathers have not hearkened 
unto the words of this book to do according unto all that which is 
written concerning us 
so hilkiah the priest and ahikam and achbor and shaphan and 
asahiah went unto huldah the prophetess the wife of shallum the son 
of tikvah the son of harhas keeper of the wardrobe now she dwelt 
in jerusalem in the college and they communed with her 
and she said unto them thus saith the lord god of israel tell 
the man that sent you to me thus saith the lord behold i will 
bring evil upon this place and upon the inhabitants thereof even all 
the words of the book which the king of judah hath read because 
they have forsaken me and have burned incense unto other gods that 
they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands 
therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place and shall not 
be quenched 
but to the king of judah which sent you to enquire of the lord 
thus shall ye say to him thus saith the lord god of israel as 
touching the words which thou hast heard because thine heart 
was tender and thou hast humbled thyself before the lord when thou 
heardest what i spake against this place and against the inhabitants 
thereof that they should become a desolation and a curse and hast 
rent thy clothes and wept before me i also have heard thee saith 
the lord 
behold therefore i will gather thee unto thy fathers and thou 
shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace and thine eyes shall not 
see all the evil which i will bring upon this place and they brought 
the king word again 
and the king sent and they gathered unto him all the elders of 
judah and of jerusalem 
and the king went up into the house of the lord and all the men 
of judah and all the inhabitants of jerusalem with him and the 
priests and the prophets and all the people both small and great 
and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant 
which was found in the house of the lord 
and the king stood by a pillar and made a covenant before the 
lord to walk after the lord and to keep his commandments and his 
testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul 
to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book 
and all the people stood to the covenant 
and the king commanded hilkiah the high priest and the priests 
of the second order and the keepers of the door to bring forth out 
of the temple of the lord all the vessels that were made for baal and 
for the grove and for all the host of heaven and he burned them 
without jerusalem in the fields of kidron and carried the ashes of 
them unto bethel 
and he put down the idolatrous priests whom the kings of judah 
had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of 
judah and in the places round about jerusalem them also that burned 
incense unto baal to the sun and to the moon and to the planets 
and to all the host of heaven 
and he brought out the grove from the house of the lord without 
jerusalem unto the brook kidron and burned it at the brook kidron 
and stamped it small to powder and cast the powder thereof upon the 
graves of the children of the people 
and he brake down the houses of the sodomites that were by the 
house of the lord where the women wove hangings for the grove 
and he brought all the priests out of the cities of judah and 
defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense from 
geba to beersheba and brake down the high places of the gates that 
were in the entering in of the gate of joshua the governor of the 
city which were on a man s left hand at the gate of the city 
nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the 
altar of the lord in jerusalem but they did eat of the unleavened 
bread among their brethren 
and he defiled topheth which is in the valley of the children 
of hinnom that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass 
through the fire to molech 
and he took away the horses that the kings of judah had given to 
the sun at the entering in of the house of the lord by the chamber 
of nathanmelech the chamberlain which was in the suburbs and burned 
the chariots of the sun with fire 
and the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of 
ahaz which the kings of judah had made and the altars which manasseh 
had made in the two courts of the house of the lord did the king beat 
down and brake them down from thence and cast the dust of them into 
the brook kidron 
and the high places that were before jerusalem which were on 
the right hand of the mount of corruption which solomon the king of 
israel had builded for ashtoreth the abomination of the zidonians and 
for chemosh the abomination of the moabites and for milcom the 
abomination of the children of ammon did the king defile 
and he brake in pieces the images and cut down the groves and 
filled their places with the bones of men 
moreover the altar that was at bethel and the high place which 
jeroboam the son of nebat who made israel to sin had made both that 
altar and the high place he brake down and burned the high place and 
stamped it small to powder and burned the grove 
and as josiah turned himself he spied the sepulchres that were 
there in the mount and sent and took the bones out of the 
sepulchres and burned them upon the altar and polluted it according 
to the word of the lord which the man of god proclaimed who 
proclaimed these words 
then he said what title is that that i see and the men of the 
city told him it is the sepulchre of the man of god which came from 
judah and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the 
altar of bethel 
and he said let him alone let no man move his bones so they 
let his bones alone with the bones of the prophet that came out of 
samaria 
and all the houses also of the high places that were in the 
cities of samaria which the kings of israel had made to provoke the 
lord to anger josiah took away and did to them according to all the 
acts that he had done in bethel 
and he slew all the priests of the high places that were there 
upon the altars and burned men s bones upon them and returned to 
jerusalem 
and the king commanded all the people saying keep the passover 
unto the lord your god as it is written in the book of this covenant 
surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of the 
judges that judged israel nor in all the days of the kings of israel 
nor of the kings of judah but in the eighteenth year of king 
josiah wherein this passover was holden to the lord in jerusalem 
moreover the workers with familiar spirits and the wizards and 
the images and the idols and all the abominations that were spied in 
the land of judah and in jerusalem did josiah put away that he might 
perform the words of the law which were written in the book that 
hilkiah the priest found in the house of the lord 
and like unto him was there no king before him that turned to 
the lord with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his 
might according to all the law of moses neither after him arose 
there any like him 
notwithstanding the lord turned not from the fierceness of his 
great wrath wherewith his anger was kindled against judah because of 
all the provocations that manasseh had provoked him withal 
and the lord said i will remove judah also out of my sight as 
i have removed israel and will cast off this city jerusalem which i 
have chosen and the house of which i said my name shall be there 
now the rest of the acts of josiah and all that he did are 
they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah 
in his days pharaohnechoh king of egypt went up against the king 
of assyria to the river euphrates and king josiah went against him 
and he slew him at megiddo when he had seen him 
and his servants carried him in a chariot dead from megiddo and 
brought him to jerusalem and buried him in his own sepulchre and the 
people of the land took jehoahaz the son of josiah and anointed him 
and made him king in his father s stead 
jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign 
and he reigned three months in jerusalem and his mother s name was 
hamutal the daughter of jeremiah of libnah 
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord 
according to all that his fathers had done 
and pharaohnechoh put him in bands at riblah in the land of 
hamath that he might not reign in jerusalem and put the land to a 
tribute of an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold 
and pharaohnechoh made eliakim the son of josiah king in the 
room of josiah his father and turned his name to jehoiakim and took 
jehoahaz away and he came to egypt and died there 
and jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to pharaoh but he 
taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of 
pharaoh he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land 
of every one according to his taxation to give it unto pharaohnechoh 
jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign 
and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem and his mother s name was 
zebudah the daughter of pedaiah of rumah 
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord 
according to all that his fathers had done 
in his days nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came up and jehoiakim 
became his servant three years then he turned and rebelled against 
him 
and the lord sent against him bands of the chaldees and bands of 
the syrians and bands of the moabites and bands of the children of 
ammon and sent them against judah to destroy it according to the 
word of the lord which he spake by his servants the prophets 
surely at the commandment of the lord came this upon judah to 
remove them out of his sight for the sins of manasseh according to 
all that he did and also for the innocent blood that he she would 
for he filled jerusalem with innocent blood which the lord would not 
pardon 
now the rest of the acts of jehoiakim and all that he did are 
they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah 
so jehoiakim slept with his fathers and jehoiachin his son 
reigned in his stead 
and the king of egypt came not again any more out of his land 
for the king of babylon had taken from the river of egypt unto the 
river euphrates all that pertained to the king of egypt 
jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign and he 
reigned in jerusalem three months and his mother s name was nehushta 
the daughter of elnathan of jerusalem 
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord 
according to all that his father had done 
at that time the servants of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came 
up against jerusalem and the city was besieged 
and nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came against the city and 
his servants did besiege it 
and jehoiachin the king of judah went out to the king of 
babylon he and his mother and his servants and his princes and 
his officers and the king of babylon took him in the eighth year of 
his reign 
and he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the 
lord and the treasures of the king s house and cut in pieces all the 
vessels of gold which solomon king of israel had made in the temple of 
the lord as the lord had said 
and he carried away all jerusalem and all the princes and all 
the mighty men of valour even ten thousand captives and all the 
craftsmen and smiths none remained save the poorest sort of the 
people of the land 
and he carried away jehoiachin to babylon and the king s 
mother and the king s wives and his officers and the mighty of the 
land those carried he into captivity from jerusalem to babylon 
and all the men of might even seven thousand and craftsmen and 
smiths a thousand all that were strong and apt for war even them the 
king of babylon brought captive to babylon 
and the king of babylon made mattaniah his father s brother king 
in his stead and changed his name to zedekiah 
zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign 
and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem and his mother s name was 
hamutal the daughter of jeremiah of libnah 
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord 
according to all that jehoiakim had done 
for through the anger of the lord it came to pass in jerusalem 
and judah until he had cast them out from his presence that zedekiah 
rebelled against the king of babylon 
and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign in the tenth 
month in the tenth day of the month that nebuchadnezzar king of 
babylon came he and all his host against jerusalem and pitched 
against it and they built forts against it round about 
and the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king 
zedekiah 
and on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed in 
the city and there was no bread for the people of the land 
and the city was broken up and all the men of war fled by night 
by the way of the gate between two walls which is by the king s 
garden now the chaldees were against the city round about and the 
king went the way toward the plain 
and the army of the chaldees pursued after the king and overtook 
him in the plains of jericho and all his army were scattered from 
him 
so they took the king and brought him up to the king of babylon 
to riblah and they gave judgment upon him 
and they slew the sons of zedekiah before his eyes and put out 
the eyes of zedekiah and bound him with fetters of brass and carried 
him to babylon 
and in the fifth month on the seventh day of the month which is 
the nineteenth year of king nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came 
nebuzaradan captain of the guard a servant of the king of babylon 
unto jerusalem and he burnt the house of the lord and the 
king s house and all the houses of jerusalem and every great man s 
house burnt he with fire 
and all the army of the chaldees that were with the captain of 
the guard brake down the walls of jerusalem round about 
now the rest of the people that were left in the city and the 
fugitives that fell away to the king of babylon with the remnant of 
the multitude did nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away 
but the captain of the guard left of the door of the poor of the 
land to be vinedressers and husbandmen 
and the pillars of brass that were in the house of the lord and 
the bases and the brasen sea that was in the house of the lord did 
the chaldees break in pieces and carried the brass of them to 
babylon 
and the pots and the shovels and the snuffers and the spoons 
and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered took they 
away 
and the firepans and the bowls and such things as were of 
gold in gold and of silver in silver the captain of the guard took 
away 
the two pillars one sea and the bases which solomon had made 
for the house of the lord the brass of all these vessels was without 
weight 
the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits and the 
chapiter upon it was brass and the height of the chapiter three 
cubits and the wreathen work and pomegranates upon the chapiter 
round about all of brass and like unto these had the second pillar 
with wreathen work 
and the captain of the guard took seraiah the chief priest and 
zephaniah the second priest and the three keepers of the door 
and out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of 
war and five men of them that were in the king s presence which were 
found in the city and the principal scribe of the host which 
mustered the people of the land and threescore men of the people of 
the land that were found in the city and nebuzaradan captain of 
the guard took these and brought them to the king of babylon to 
riblah and the king of babylon smote them and slew them at 
riblah in the land of hamath so judah was carried away out of their 
land 
and as for the people that remained in the land of judah whom 
nebuchadnezzar king of babylon had left even over them he made 
gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan ruler 
and when all the captains of the armies they and their men 
heard that the king of babylon had made gedaliah governor there came 
to gedaliah to mizpah even ishmael the son of nethaniah and johanan 
the son of careah and seraiah the son of tanhumeth the netophathite 
and jaazaniah the son of a maachathite they and their men 
and gedaliah sware to them and to their men and said unto 
them fear not to be the servants of the chaldees dwell in the land 
and serve the king of babylon and it shall be well with you 
but it came to pass in the seventh month that ishmael the son 
of nethaniah the son of elishama of the seed royal came and ten 
men with him and smote gedaliah that he died and the jews and the 
chaldees that were with him at mizpah 
and all the people both small and great and the captains of 
the armies arose and came to egypt for they were afraid of the 
chaldees 
and it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the 
captivity of jehoiachin king of judah in the twelfth month on the 
seven and twentieth day of the month that evilmerodach king of 
babylon in the year that he began to reign did lift up the head of 
jehoiachin king of judah out of prison and he spake kindly to 
him and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with 
him in babylon and changed his prison garments and he did eat 
bread continually before him all the days of his life 
and his allowance was a continual allowance given him of the 
king a daily rate for every day all the days of his life

and adaiah the son of jeroham the son of pashur the son of 
malchijah and maasiai the son of adiel the son of jahzerah the son 
of meshullam the son of meshillemith the son of immer and 
their brethren heads of the house of their fathers a thousand and 
seven hundred and threescore very able men for the work of the 
service of the house of god 
and of the levites shemaiah the son of hasshub the son of 
azrikam the son of hashabiah of the sons of merari and 
bakbakkar heresh and galal and mattaniah the son of micah the son 
of zichri the son of asaph and obadiah the son of shemaiah the 
son of galal the son of jeduthun and berechiah the son of asa the 
son of elkanah that dwelt in the villages of the netophathites 
and the porters were shallum and akkub and talmon and ahiman 
and their brethren shallum was the chief who hitherto waited in 
the king s gate eastward they were porters in the companies of the 
children of levi 
and shallum the son of kore the son of ebiasaph the son of 
korah and his brethren of the house of his father the korahites 
were over the work of the service keepers of the gates of the 
tabernacle and their fathers being over the host of the lord were 
keepers of the entry 
and phinehas the son of eleazar was the ruler over them in time 
past and the lord was with him 
and zechariah the son of meshelemiah was porter of the door of 
the tabernacle of the congregation 
all these which were chosen to be porters in the gates were two 
hundred and twelve these were reckoned by their genealogy in their 
villages whom david and samuel the seer did ordain in their set 
office 
so they and their children had the oversight of the gates of the 
house of the lord namely the house of the tabernacle by wards 
in four quarters were the porters toward the east west north 
and south 
and their brethren which were in their villages were to come 
after seven days from time to time with them 
for these levites the four chief porters were in their set 
office and were over the chambers and treasuries of the house of god 
and they lodged round about the house of god because the charge 
was upon them and the opening thereof every morning pertained to 
them 
and certain of them had the charge of the ministering vessels 
that they should bring them in and out by tale 
some of them also were appointed to oversee the vessels and all 
the instruments of the sanctuary and the fine flour and the wine 
and the oil and the frankincense and the spices 
and some of the sons of the priests made the ointment of the 
spices 
and mattithiah one of the levites who was the firstborn of 
shallum the korahite had the set office over the things that were 
made in the pans 
and other of their brethren of the sons of the kohathites were 
over the shewbread to prepare it every sabbath 
and these are the singers chief of the fathers of the levites 
who remaining in the chambers were free for they were employed in 
that work day and night 
these chief fathers of the levites were chief throughout their 
generations these dwelt at jerusalem 
and in gibeon dwelt the father of gibeon jehiel whose wife s 
name was maachah and his firstborn son abdon then zur and 
kish and baal and ner and nadab 
and gedor and ahio and zechariah and mikloth 
and mikloth begat shimeam and they also dwelt with their 
brethren at jerusalem over against their brethren 
and ner begat kish and kish begat saul and saul begat jonathan 
and malchishua and abinadab and eshbaal 
and the son of jonathan was meribbaal and meribbaal begat micah 
and the sons of micah were pithon and melech and tahrea and 
ahaz 
and ahaz begat jarah and jarah begat alemeth and azmaveth and 
zimri and zimri begat moza and moza begat binea and rephaiah 
his son eleasah his son azel his son 
and azel had six sons whose names are these azrikam bocheru 
and ishmael and sheariah and obadiah and hanan these were the sons 
of azel 
now the philistines fought against israel and the men of israel 
fled from before the philistines and fell down slain in mount gilboa 
and the philistines followed hard after saul and after his sons 
and the philistines slew jonathan and abinadab and malchishua the 
sons of saul 
and the battle went sore against saul and the archers hit him 
and he was wounded of the archers 
then said saul to his armourbearer draw thy sword and thrust me 
through therewith lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me but his 
armourbearer would not for he was sore afraid so saul took a sword 
and fell upon it 
and when his armourbearer saw that saul was dead he fell 
likewise on the sword and died 
so saul died and his three sons and all his house died 
together 
and when all the men of israel that were in the valley saw that 
they fled and that saul and his sons were dead then they forsook 
their cities and fled and the philistines came and dwelt in them 
and it came to pass on the morrow when the philistines came to 
strip the slain that they found saul and his sons fallen in mount 
gilboa 
and when they had stripped him they took his head and his 
armour and sent into the land of the philistines round about to 
carry tidings unto their idols and to the people 
and they put his armour in the house of their gods and fastened 
his head in the temple of dagon 
and when all jabeshgilead heard all that the philistines had 
done to saul they arose all the valiant men and took away the 
body of saul and the bodies of his sons and brought them to jabesh 
and buried their bones under the oak in jabesh and fasted seven days 
so saul died for his transgression which he committed against 
the lord even against the word of the lord which he kept not and 
also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar spirit to enquire 
of it and enquired not of the lord therefore he slew him and 
turned the kingdom unto david the son of jesse 
then all israel gathered themselves to david unto hebron saying 
behold we are thy bone and thy flesh 
and moreover in time past even when saul was king thou wast he 
that leddest out and broughtest in israel and the lord thy god said 
unto thee thou shalt feed my people israel and thou shalt be ruler 
over my people israel 
therefore came all the elders of israel to the king to hebron 
and david made a covenant with them in hebron before the lord and 
they anointed david king over israel according to the word of the 
lord by samuel 
and david and all israel went to jerusalem which is jebus where 
the jebusites were the inhabitants of the land 
and the inhabitants of jebus said to david thou shalt not come 
hither nevertheless david took the castle of zion which is the city 
of david 
and david said whosoever smiteth the jebusites first shall be 
chief and captain so joab the son of zeruiah went first up and was 
chief 
and david dwelt in the castle therefore they called it the city 
of david 
and he built the city round about even from millo round about 
and joab repaired the rest of the city 
so david waxed greater and greater for the lord of hosts was 
with him 
these also are the chief of the mighty men whom david had who 
strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom and with all israel 
to make him king according to the word of the lord concerning israel 
and this is the number of the mighty men whom david had 
jashobeam an hachmonite the chief of the captains he lifted up his 
spear against three hundred slain by him at one time 
and after him was eleazar the son of dodo the ahohite who was 
one of the three mighties 
he was with david at pasdammim and there the philistines were 
gathered together to battle where was a parcel of ground full of 
barley and the people fled from before the philistines 
and they set themselves in the midst of that parcel and 
delivered it and slew the philistines and the lord saved them by a 
great deliverance 
now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to david 
into the cave of adullam and the host of the philistines encamped in 
the valley of rephaim 
and david was then in the hold and the philistines garrison 
was then at bethlehem 
and david longed and said oh that one would give me drink of 
the water of the well of bethlehem that is at the gate and 
the three brake through the host of the philistines and drew water 
out of the well of bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and 
brought it to david but david would not drink of it but poured it 
out to the lord 
and said my god forbid it me that i should do this thing 
shall i drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in 
jeopardy for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it 
therefore he would not drink it 
these things did these three mightiest 
and abishai the brother of joab he was chief of the three for 
lifting up his spear against three hundred he slew them and had a 
name among the three 
of the three he was more honourable than the two for he was 
their captain howbeit he attained not to the first three 
benaiah the son of jehoiada the son of a valiant man of 
kabzeel who had done many acts he slew two lionlike men of moab 
also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day 
and he slew an egyptian a man of great stature five cubits 
high and in the egyptian s hand was a spear like a weaver s beam and 
he went down to him with a staff and plucked the spear out of the 
egyptian s hand and slew him with his own spear 
these things did benaiah the son of jehoiada and had the name 
among the three mighties 
behold he was honourable among the thirty but attained not to 
the first three and david set him over his guard 
also the valiant men of the armies were asahel the brother of 
joab elhanan the son of dodo of bethlehem shammoth the 
harorite helez the pelonite ira the son of ikkesh the tekoite 
abiezer the antothite sibbecai the hushathite ilai the 
ahohite maharai the netophathite heled the son of baanah the 
netophathite ithai the son of ribai of gibeah that pertained 
to the children of benjamin benaiah the pirathonite hurai of 
the brooks of gaash abiel the arbathite azmaveth the 
baharumite eliahba the shaalbonite the sons of hashem the 
gizonite jonathan the son of shage the hararite ahiam the son 
of sacar the hararite eliphal the son of you are hepher the 
mecherathite ahijah the pelonite hezro the carmelite naarai 
the son of ezbai joel the brother of nathan mibhar the son of 
haggeri zelek the ammonite naharai the berothite the 
armourbearer of joab the son of zeruiah ira the ithrite gareb 
the ithrite uriah the hittite zabad the son of ahlai 
adina the son of shiza the reubenite a captain of the reubenites and 
thirty with him hanan the son of maachah and joshaphat the 
mithnite uzzia the ashterathite shama and jehiel the sons of 
hothan the aroerite jediael the son of shimri and joha his 
brother the tizite eliel the mahavite and jeribai and 
joshaviah the sons of elnaam and ithmah the moabite eliel 
and obed and jasiel the mesobaite 
now these are they that came to david to ziklag while he yet 
kept himself close because of saul the son of kish and they were 
among the mighty men helpers of the war 
they were armed with bows and could use both the right hand and 
the left in hurling stones and shooting arrows out of a bow even of 
saul s brethren of benjamin 
the chief was ahiezer then joash the sons of shemaah the 
gibeathite and jeziel and pelet the sons of azmaveth and berachah 
and jehu the antothite 
and ismaiah the gibeonite a mighty man among the thirty and 
over the thirty and jeremiah and jahaziel and johanan and josabad 
the gederathite eluzai and jerimoth and bealiah and 
shemariah and shephatiah the haruphite elkanah and jesiah and 
azareel and joezer and jashobeam the korhites and joelah and 
zebadiah the sons of jeroham of gedor 
and of the gadites there separated themselves unto david into the 
hold to the wilderness men of might and men of war fit for the 
battle that could handle shield and buckler whose faces were like 
the faces of lions and were as swift as the roes upon the mountains 
ezer the first obadiah the second eliab the third 
mishmannah the fourth jeremiah the fifth attai the sixth 
eliel the seventh johanan the eighth elzabad the ninth 
jeremiah the tenth machbanai the eleventh 
these were of the sons of gad captains of the host one of the 
least was over an hundred and the greatest over a thousand 
these are they that went over jordan in the first month when it 
had overflown all his banks and they put to flight all them of the 
valleys both toward the east and toward the west 
and there came of the children of benjamin and judah to the hold 
unto david 
and david went out to meet them and answered and said unto 
them if ye be come peaceably unto me to help me mine heart shall be 
knit unto you but if ye be come to betray me to mine enemies seeing 
there is no wrong in mine hands the god of our fathers look thereon 
and rebuke it 
then the spirit came upon amasai who was chief of the captains 
and he said thine are we david and on thy side thou son of jesse 
peace peace be unto thee and peace be to thine helpers for thy god 
helpeth thee 
then david received them and made them captains of the band 
and there fell some of manasseh to david when he came with the 
philistines against saul to battle but they helped them not for the 
lords of the philistines upon advisement sent him away saying he 
will fall to his master saul to the jeopardy of our heads 
as he went to ziklag there fell to him of manasseh adnah and 
jozabad and jediael and michael and jozabad and elihu and 
zilthai captains of the thousands that were of manasseh 
and they helped david against the band of the rovers for they 
were all mighty men of valour and were captains in the host 
for at that time day by day there came to david to help him 
until it was a great host like the host of god 
and these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to 
the war and came to david to hebron to turn the kingdom of saul to 
him according to the word of the lord 
the children of judah that bare shield and spear were six 
thousand and eight hundred ready armed to the war 
of the children of simeon mighty men of valour for the war 
seven thousand and one hundred 
of the children of levi four thousand and six hundred 
and jehoiada was the leader of the aaronites and with him were 
three thousand and seven hundred and zadok a young man mighty 
of valour and of his father s house twenty and two captains 
and of the children of benjamin the kindred of saul three 
thousand for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the ward of 
the house of saul 
and of the children of ephraim twenty thousand and eight 
hundred mighty men of valour famous throughout the house of their 
fathers 
and of the half tribe of manasseh eighteen thousand which were 
expressed by name to come and make david king 
and of the children of issachar which were men that had 
understanding of the times to know what israel ought to do the heads 
of them were two hundred and all their brethren were at their 
commandment 
of zebulun such as went forth to battle expert in war with 
all instruments of war fifty thousand which could keep rank they 
were not of double heart 
and of naphtali a thousand captains and with them with shield 
and spear thirty and seven thousand 
and of the danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and 
six hundred 
and of asher such as went forth to battle expert in war forty 
thousand 
and on the other side of jordan of the reubenites and the 
gadites and of the half tribe of manasseh with all manner of 
instruments of war for the battle an hundred and twenty thousand 
all these men of war that could keep rank came with a perfect 
heart to hebron to make david king over all israel and all the rest 
also of israel were of one heart to make david king 
and there they were with david three days eating and drinking 
for their brethren had prepared for them 
moreover they that were nigh them even unto issachar and 
zebulun and naphtali brought bread on asses and on camels and on 
mules and on oxen and meat meal cakes of figs and bunches of 
raisins and wine and oil and oxen and sheep abundantly for there 
was joy in israel 
and david consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds 
and with every leader 
and david said unto all the congregation of israel if it seem 
good unto you and that it be of the lord our god let us send abroad 
unto our brethren every where that are left in all the land of 
israel and with them also to the priests and levites which are in 
their cities and suburbs that they may gather themselves unto us 
and let us bring again the ark of our god to us for we enquired 
not at it in the days of saul 
and all the congregation said that they would do so for the 
thing was right in the eyes of all the people 
so david gathered all israel together from shihor of egypt even 
unto the entering of hemath to bring the ark of god from 
kirjathjearim 
and david went up and all israel to baalah that is to 
kirjathjearim which belonged to judah to bring up thence the ark of 
god the lord that dwelleth between the cherubims whose name is 
called on it 
and they carried the ark of god in a new cart out of the house of 
abinadab and uzza and ahio drave the cart 
and david and all israel played before god with all their might 
and with singing and with harps and with psalteries and with 
timbrels and with cymbals and with trumpets 
and when they came unto the threshingfloor of chidon uzza put 
forth his hand to hold the ark for the oxen stumbled 
and the anger of the lord was kindled against uzza and he smote 
him because he put his hand to the ark and there he died before god 
and david was displeased because the lord had made a breach 
upon uzza wherefore that place is called perezuzza to this day 
and david was afraid of god that day saying how shall i bring 
the ark of god home to me so david brought not the ark home to 
himself to the city of david but carried it aside into the house of 
obededom the gittite 
and the ark of god remained with the family of obededom in his 
house three months and the lord blessed the house of obededom and 
all that he had 
now hiram king of tyre sent messengers to david and timber of 
cedars with masons and carpenters to build him an house 
and david perceived that the lord had confirmed him king over 
israel for his kingdom was lifted up on high because of his people 
israel 
and david took more wives at jerusalem and david begat more sons 
and daughters 
now these are the names of his children which he had in 
jerusalem shammua and shobab nathan and solomon and ibhar 
and elishua and elpalet and nogah and nepheg and japhia 
and elishama and beeliada and eliphalet 
and when the philistines heard that david was anointed king over 
all israel all the philistines went up to seek david and david heard 
of it and went out against them 
and the philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of 
rephaim 
and david enquired of god saying shall i go up against the 
philistines and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand and the lord 
said unto him go up for i will deliver them into thine hand 
so they came up to baalperazim and david smote them there then 
david said god hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the 
breaking forth of waters therefore they called the name of that place 
baalperazim 
and when they had left their gods there david gave a 
commandment and they were burned with fire 
and the philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the 
valley 
therefore david enquired again of god and god said unto him go 
not up after them turn away from them and come upon them over 
against the mulberry trees 
and it shall be when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the 
tops of the mulberry trees that then thou shalt go out to battle for 
god is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the philistines 
david therefore did as god commanded him and they smote the 
host of the philistines from gibeon even to gazer 
and the fame of david went out into all lands and the lord 
brought the fear of him upon all nations 
and david made him houses in the city of david and prepared a 
place for the ark of god and pitched for it a tent 
then david said none ought to carry the ark of god but the 
levites for them hath the lord chosen to carry the ark of god and to 
minister unto him for ever 
and david gathered all israel together to jerusalem to bring up 
the ark of the lord unto his place which he had prepared for it 
and david assembled the children of aaron and the levites 
of the sons of kohath uriel the chief and his brethren an hundred 
and twenty of the sons of merari asaiah the chief and his 
brethren two hundred and twenty of the sons of gershom joel the 
chief and his brethren an hundred and thirty of the sons of 
elizaphan shemaiah the chief and his brethren two hundred of 
the sons of hebron eliel the chief and his brethren fourscore 
of the sons of uzziel amminadab the chief and his brethren an 
hundred and twelve 
and david called for zadok and abiathar the priests and for the 
levites for uriel asaiah and joel shemaiah and eliel and 
amminadab and said unto them ye are the chief of the fathers 
of the levites sanctify yourselves both ye and your brethren that 
ye may bring up the ark of the lord god of israel unto the place that 
i have prepared for it 
for because ye did it not at the first the lord our god made a 
breach upon us for that we sought him not after the due order 
so the priests and the levites sanctified themselves to bring up 
the ark of the lord god of israel 
and the children of the levites bare the ark of god upon their 
shoulders with the staves thereon as moses commanded according to the 
word of the lord 
and david spake to the chief of the levites to appoint their 
brethren to be the singers with instruments of musick psalteries and 
harps and cymbals sounding by lifting up the voice with joy 
so the levites appointed heman the son of joel and of his 
brethren asaph the son of berechiah and of the sons of merari their 
brethren ethan the son of kushaiah and with them their 
brethren of the second degree zechariah ben and jaaziel and 
shemiramoth and jehiel and unni eliab and benaiah and maaseiah 
and mattithiah and elipheleh and mikneiah and obededom and jeiel 
the porters 
so the singers heman asaph and ethan were appointed to sound 
with cymbals of brass and zechariah and aziel and 
shemiramoth and jehiel and unni and eliab and maaseiah and 
benaiah with psalteries on alamoth and mattithiah and 
elipheleh and mikneiah and obededom and jeiel and azaziah with 
harps on the sheminith to excel 
and chenaniah chief of the levites was for song he instructed 
about the song because he was skilful 
and berechiah and elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark 
and shebaniah and jehoshaphat and nethaneel and amasai and 
zechariah and benaiah and eliezer the priests did blow with the 
trumpets before the ark of god and obededom and jehiah were 
doorkeepers for the ark 
so david and the elders of israel and the captains over 
thousands went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the lord out of 
the house of obededom with joy 
and it came to pass when god helped the levites that bare the 
ark of the covenant of the lord that they offered seven bullocks and 
seven rams 
and david was clothed with a robe of fine linen and all the 
levites that bare the ark and the singers and chenaniah the master 
of the song with the singers david also had upon him an ephod of 
linen 
thus all israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the lord 
with shouting and with sound of the cornet and with trumpets and 
with cymbals making a noise with psalteries and harps 
and it came to pass as the ark of the covenant of the lord came 
to the city of david that michal the daughter of saul looking out at 
a window saw king david dancing and playing and she despised him in 
her heart 
so they brought the ark of god and set it in the midst of the 
tent that david had pitched for it and they offered burnt sacrifices 
and peace offerings before god 
and when david had made an end of offering the burnt offerings 
and the peace offerings he blessed the people in the name of the 
lord 
and he dealt to every one of israel both man and woman to every 
one a loaf of bread and a good piece of flesh and a flagon of wine 
and he appointed certain of the levites to minister before the 
ark of the lord and to record and to thank and praise the lord god 
of israel asaph the chief and next to him zechariah jeiel and 
shemiramoth and jehiel and mattithiah and eliab and benaiah and 
obededom and jeiel with psalteries and with harps but asaph made a 
sound with cymbals benaiah also and jahaziel the priests with 
trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of god 
then on that day david delivered first this psalm to thank the 
lord into the hand of asaph and his brethren 
give thanks unto the lord call upon his name make known his 
deeds among the people 
sing unto him sing psalms unto him talk ye of all his wondrous 
works 
glory ye in his holy name let the heart of them rejoice that 
seek the lord 
seek the lord and his strength seek his face continually 
remember his marvellous works that he hath done his wonders 
and the judgments of his mouth o ye seed of israel his servant 
ye children of jacob his chosen ones 
he is the lord our god his judgments are in all the earth 
be ye mindful always of his covenant the word which he 
commanded to a thousand generations even of the covenant which 
he made with abraham and of his oath unto isaac and hath 
confirmed the same to jacob for a law and to israel for an 
everlasting covenant saying unto thee will i give the land of 
canaan the lot of your inheritance when ye were but few even 
a few and strangers in it 
and when they went from nation to nation and from one kingdom 
to another people he suffered no man to do them wrong yea he 
reproved kings for their sakes saying touch not mine anointed 
and do my prophets no harm 
sing unto the lord all the earth shew forth from day to day 
his salvation 
declare his glory among the heathen his marvellous works among 
all nations 
for great is the lord and greatly to be praised he also is to 
be feared above all gods 
for all the gods of the people are idols but the lord made the 
heavens 
glory and honour are in his presence strength and gladness are 
in his place 
give unto the lord ye kindreds of the people give unto the 
lord glory and strength 
give unto the lord the glory due unto his name bring an 
offering and come before him worship the lord in the beauty of 
holiness 
fear before him all the earth the world also shall be stable 
that it be not moved 
let the heavens be glad and let the earth rejoice and let men 
say among the nations the lord reigneth 
let the sea roar and the fulness thereof let the fields 
rejoice and all that is therein 
then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the 
lord because he cometh to judge the earth 
o give thanks unto the lord for he is good for his mercy 
endureth for ever 
and say ye save us o god of our salvation and gather us 
together and deliver us from the heathen that we may give thanks to 
thy holy name and glory in thy praise 
blessed be the lord god of israel for ever and ever and all the 
people said amen and praised the lord 
so he left there before the ark of the covenant of the lord 
asaph and his brethren to minister before the ark continually as 
every day s work required and obededom with their brethren 
threescore and eight obededom also the son of jeduthun and hosah to 
be porters and zadok the priest and his brethren the priests 
before the tabernacle of the lord in the high place that was at 
gibeon to offer burnt offerings unto the lord upon the altar of 
the burnt offering continually morning and evening and to do 
according to all that is written in the law of the lord which he 
commanded israel and with them heman and jeduthun and the rest 
that were chosen who were expressed by name to give thanks to the 
lord because his mercy endureth for ever and with them heman 
and jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a 
sound and with musical instruments of god and the sons of jeduthun 
were porters 
and all the people departed every man to his house and david 
returned to bless his house 
now it came to pass as david sat in his house that david said 
to nathan the prophet lo i dwell in an house of cedars but the ark 
of the covenant of the lord remaineth under curtains 
then nathan said unto david do all that is in thine heart for 
god is with thee 
and it came to pass the same night that the word of god came to 
nathan saying go and tell david my servant thus saith the 
lord thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in for i have 
not dwelt in an house since the day that i brought up israel unto this 
day but have gone from tent to tent and from one tabernacle to 
another 
wheresoever i have walked with all israel spake i a word to any 
of the judges of israel whom i commanded to feed my people saying 
why have ye not built me an house of cedars now therefore thus 
shalt thou say unto my servant david thus saith the lord of hosts i 
took thee from the sheepcote even from following the sheep that thou 
shouldest be ruler over my people israel and i have been with 
thee whithersoever thou hast walked and have cut off all thine 
enemies from before thee and have made thee a name like the name of 
the great men that are in the earth 
also i will ordain a place for my people israel and will plant 
them and they shall dwell in their place and shall be moved no more 
neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more as at 
the beginning and since the time that i commanded judges to be 
over my people israel moreover i will subdue all thine enemies 
furthermore i tell thee that the lord will build thee an house 
and it shall come to pass when thy days be expired that thou 
must go to be with thy fathers that i will raise up thy seed after 
thee which shall be of thy sons and i will establish his kingdom 
he shall build me an house and i will stablish his throne for 
ever 
i will be his father and he shall be my son and i will not 
take my mercy away from him as i took it from him that was before 
thee but i will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for 
ever and his throne shall be established for evermore 
according to all these words and according to all this vision 
so did nathan speak unto david 
and david the king came and sat before the lord and said who 
am i o lord god and what is mine house that thou hast brought me 
hitherto and yet this was a small thing in thine eyes o god 
for thou hast also spoken of thy servant s house for a great while to 
come and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high 
degree o lord god 
what can david speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant 
for thou knowest thy servant 
o lord for thy servant s sake and according to thine own 
heart hast thou done all this greatness in making known all these 
great things 
o lord there is none like thee neither is there any god beside 
thee according to all that we have heard with our ears 
and what one nation in the earth is like thy people israel whom 
god went to redeem to be his own people to make thee a name of 
greatness and terribleness by driving out nations from before thy 
people whom thou hast redeemed out of egypt for thy people 
israel didst thou make thine own people for ever and thou lord 
becamest their god 
therefore now lord let the thing that thou hast spoken 
concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for 
ever and do as thou hast said 
let it even be established that thy name may be magnified for 
ever saying the lord of hosts is the god of israel even a god to 
israel and let the house of david thy servant be established before 
thee 
for thou o my god hast told thy servant that thou wilt build 
him an house therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray 
before thee 
and now lord thou art god and hast promised this goodness 
unto thy servant now therefore let it please thee to bless the 
house of thy servant that it may be before thee for ever for thou 
blessest o lord and it shall be blessed for ever 
now after this it came to pass that david smote the philistines 
and subdued them and took gath and her towns out of the hand of the 
philistines 
and he smote moab and the moabites became david s servants and 
brought gifts 
and david smote hadarezer king of zobah unto hamath as he went 
to stablish his dominion by the river euphrates 
and david took from him a thousand chariots and seven thousand 
horsemen and twenty thousand footmen david also houghed all the 
chariot horses but reserved of them an hundred chariots 
and when the syrians of damascus came to help hadarezer king of 
zobah david slew of the syrians two and twenty thousand men 
then david put garrisons in syriadamascus and the syrians became 
david s servants and brought gifts thus the lord preserved david 
whithersoever he went 
and david took the shields of gold that were on the servants of 
hadarezer and brought them to jerusalem 
likewise from tibhath and from chun cities of hadarezer 
brought david very much brass wherewith solomon made the brasen sea 
and the pillars and the vessels of brass 
now when tou king of hamath heard how david had smitten all the 
host of hadarezer king of zobah he sent hadoram his son to king 
david to enquire of his welfare and to congratulate him because he 
had fought against hadarezer and smitten him for hadarezer had war 
with tou and with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and 
brass 
them also king david dedicated unto the lord with the silver 
and the gold that he brought from all these nations from edom and 
from moab and from the children of ammon and from the philistines 
and from amalek 
moreover abishai the son of zeruiah slew of the edomites in the 
valley of salt eighteen thousand 
and he put garrisons in edom and all the edomites became 
david s servants thus the lord preserved david whithersoever he went 
so david reigned over all israel and executed judgment and 
justice among all his people 
and joab the son of zeruiah was over the host and jehoshaphat 
the son of ahilud recorder 
and zadok the son of ahitub and abimelech the son of abiathar 
were the priests and shavsha was scribe and benaiah the son of 
jehoiada was over the cherethites and the pelethites and the sons of 
david were chief about the king 
now it came to pass after this that nahash the king of the 
children of ammon died and his son reigned in his stead 
and david said i will shew kindness unto hanun the son of 
nahash because his father shewed kindness to me and david sent 
messengers to comfort him concerning his father so the servants of 
david came into the land of the children of ammon to hanun to comfort 
him 
but the princes of the children of ammon said to hanun thinkest 
thou that david doth honour thy father that he hath sent comforters 
unto thee are not his servants come unto thee for to search and to 
overthrow and to spy out the land wherefore hanun took david s 
servants and shaved them and cut off their garments in the midst 
hard by their buttocks and sent them away 
then there went certain and told david how the men were served 
and he sent to meet them for the men were greatly ashamed and the 
king said tarry at jericho until your beards be grown and then 
return 
and when the children of ammon saw that they had made themselves 
odious to david hanun and the children of ammon sent a thousand 
talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of 
mesopotamia and out of syriamaachah and out of zobah 
so they hired thirty and two thousand chariots and the king of 
maachah and his people who came and pitched before medeba and the 
children of ammon gathered themselves together from their cities and 
came to battle 
and when david heard of it he sent joab and all the host of the 
mighty men 
and the children of ammon came out and put the battle in array 
before the gate of the city and the kings that were come were by 
themselves in the field 
now when joab saw that the battle was set against him before and 
behind he chose out of all the choice of israel and put them in 
array against the syrians 
and the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of abishai 
his brother and they set themselves in array against the children of 
ammon 
and he said if the syrians be too strong for me then thou 
shalt help me but if the children of ammon be too strong for thee 
then i will help thee 
be of good courage and let us behave ourselves valiantly for 
our people and for the cities of our god and let the lord do that 
which is good in his sight 
so joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the 
syrians unto the battle and they fled before him 
and when the children of ammon saw that the syrians were fled 
they likewise fled before abishai his brother and entered into the 
city then joab came to jerusalem 
and when the syrians saw that they were put to the worse before 
israel they sent messengers and drew forth the syrians that were 
beyond the river and shophach the captain of the host of hadarezer 
went before them 
and it was told david and he gathered all israel and passed 
over jordan and came upon them and set the battle in array against 
them so when david had put the battle in array against the syrians 
they fought with him 
but the syrians fled before israel and david slew of the 
syrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots and forty 
thousand footmen and killed shophach the captain of the host 
and when the servants of hadarezer saw that they were put to the 
worse before israel they made peace with david and became his 
servants neither would the syrians help the children of ammon any 
more 
and it came to pass that after the year was expired at the time 
that kings go out to battle joab led forth the power of the army and 
wasted the country of the children of ammon and came and besieged 
rabbah but david tarried at jerusalem and joab smote rabbah and 
destroyed it 
and david took the crown of their king from off his head and 
found it to weigh a talent of gold and there were precious stones in 
it and it was set upon david s head and he brought also exceeding 
much spoil out of the city 
and he brought out the people that were in it and cut them with 
saws and with harrows of iron and with axes even so dealt david 
with all the cities of the children of ammon and david and all the 
people returned to jerusalem 
and it came to pass after this that there arose war at gezer 
with the philistines at which time sibbechai the hushathite slew 
sippai that was of the children of the giant and they were subdued 
and there was war again with the philistines and elhanan the son 
of jair slew lahmi the brother of goliath the gittite whose spear 
staff was like a weaver s beam 
and yet again there was war at gath where was a man of great 
stature whose fingers and toes were four and twenty six on each 
hand and six on each foot and he also was the son of the giant 
but when he defied israel jonathan the son of shimea david s 
brother slew him 
these were born unto the giant in gath and they fell by the hand 
of david and by the hand of his servants 
and satan stood up against israel and provoked david to number 
israel 
and david said to joab and to the rulers of the people go 
number israel from beersheba even to dan and bring the number of them 
to me that i may know it 
and joab answered the lord make his people an hundred times so 
many more as they be but my lord the king are they not all my 
lord s servants why then doth my lord require this thing why will 
he be a because of trespass to israel nevertheless the king s 
word prevailed against joab wherefore joab departed and went 
throughout all israel and came to jerusalem 
and joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto david and 
all they of israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand 
men that drew sword and judah was four hundred threescore and ten 
thousand men that drew sword 
but levi and benjamin counted he not among them for the king s 
word was abominable to joab 
and god was displeased with this thing therefore he smote 
israel 
and david said unto god i have sinned greatly because i have 
done this thing but now i beseech thee do away the iniquity of thy 
servant for i have done very foolishly 
and the lord spake unto gad david s seer saying go and 
tell david saying thus saith the lord i offer thee three things 
choose thee one of them that i may do it unto thee 
so gad came to david and said unto him thus saith the lord 
choose thee either three years famine or three months to be 
destroyed before thy foes while that the sword of thine enemies 
overtaketh thee or else three days the sword of the lord even the 
pestilence in the land and the angel of the lord destroying 
throughout all the coasts of israel now therefore advise thyself what 
word i shall bring again to him that sent me 
and david said unto gad i am in a great strait let me fall now 
into the hand of the lord for very great are his mercies but let me 
not fall into the hand of man 
so the lord sent pestilence upon israel and there fell of 
israel seventy thousand men 
and god sent an angel unto jerusalem to destroy it and as he 
was destroying the lord beheld and he repented him of the evil and 
said to the angel that destroyed it is enough stay now thine hand 
and the angel of the lord stood by the threshingfloor of ornan the 
jebusite 
and david lifted up his eyes and saw the angel of the lord 
stand between the earth and the heaven having a drawn sword in his 
hand stretched out over jerusalem then david and the elders of 
israel who were clothed in sackcloth fell upon their faces 
and david said unto god is it not i that commanded the people 
to be numbered even i it is that have sinned and done evil indeed 
but as for these sheep what have they done let thine hand i pray 
thee o lord my god be on me and on my father s house but not on 
thy people that they should be plagued 
then the angel of the lord commanded gad to say to david that 
david should go up and set up an altar unto the lord in the 
threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite 
and david went up at the saying of gad which he spake in the 
name of the lord 
and ornan turned back and saw the angel and his four sons with 
him hid themselves now ornan was threshing wheat 
and as david came to ornan ornan looked and saw david and went 
out of the threshingfloor and bowed himself to david with his face to 
the ground 
then david said to ornan grant me the place of this 
threshingfloor that i may build an altar therein unto the lord thou 
shalt grant it me for the full price that the plague may be stayed 
from the people 
and ornan said unto david take it to thee and let my lord the 
king do that which is good in his eyes lo i give thee the oxen also 
for burnt offerings and the threshing instruments for wood and the 
wheat for the meat offering i give it all 
and king david said to ornan nay but i will verily buy it for 
the full price for i will not take that which is thine for the lord 
nor offer burnt offerings without cost 
so david gave to ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold 
by weight 
and david built there an altar unto the lord and offered burnt 
offerings and peace offerings and called upon the lord and he 
answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering 
and the lord commanded the angel and he put up his sword again 
into the sheath thereof 
at that time when david saw that the lord had answered him in 
the threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite then he sacrificed there 
for the tabernacle of the lord which moses made in the 
wilderness and the altar of the burnt offering were at that season 
in the high place at gibeon 
but david could not go before it to enquire of god for he was 
afraid because of the sword of the angel of the lord 
then david said this is the house of the lord god and this is 
the altar of the burnt offering for israel 
and david commanded to gather together the strangers that were in 
the land of israel and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build 
the house of god 
and david prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors 
of the gates and for the joinings and brass in abundance without 
weight also cedar trees in abundance for the zidonians and they 
of tyre brought much cedar wood to david 
and david said solomon my son is young and tender and the house 
that is to be builded for the lord must be exceeding magnifical of 
fame and of glory throughout all countries i will therefore now make 
preparation for it so david prepared abundantly before his death 
then he called for solomon his son and charged him to build an 
house for the lord god of israel 
and david said to solomon my son as for me it was in my mind 
to build an house unto the name of the lord my god but the word 
of the lord came to me saying thou hast she would blood abundantly and 
hast made great wars thou shalt not build an house unto my name 
because thou hast she would much blood upon the earth in my sight 
behold a son shall be born to thee who shall be a man of rest 
and i will give him rest from all his enemies round about for his 
name shall be solomon and i will give peace and quietness unto israel 
in his days 
he shall build an house for my name and he shall be my son and 
i will be his father and i will establish the throne of his kingdom 
over israel for ever 
now my son the lord be with thee and prosper thou and build 
the house of the lord thy god as he hath said of thee 
only the lord give thee wisdom and understanding and give thee 
charge concerning israel that thou mayest keep the law of the lord 
thy god 
then shalt thou prosper if thou takest heed to fulfil the 
statutes and judgments which the lord charged moses with concerning 
israel be strong and of good courage dread not nor be dismayed 
now behold in my trouble i have prepared for the house of the 
lord an hundred thousand talents of gold and a thousand thousand 
talents of silver and of brass and iron without weight for it is in 
abundance timber also and stone have i prepared and thou mayest add 
thereto 
moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance hewers and 
workers of stone and timber and all manner of cunning men for every 
manner of work 
of the gold the silver and the brass and the iron there is 
no number arise therefore and be doing and the lord be with thee 
david also commanded all the princes of israel to help solomon 
his son saying is not the lord your god with you and hath he 
not given you rest on every side for he hath given the inhabitants of 
the land into mine hand and the land is subdued before the lord and 
before his people 
now set your heart and your soul to seek the lord your god 
arise therefore and build ye the sanctuary of the lord god to bring 
the ark of the covenant of the lord and the holy vessels of god into 
the house that is to be built to the name of the lord 
so when david was old and full of days he made solomon his son 
king over israel 
and he gathered together all the princes of israel with the 
priests and the levites 
now the levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and 
upward and their number by their polls man by man was thirty and 
eight thousand 
of which twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work 
of the house of the lord and six thousand were officers and judges 
moreover four thousand were porters and four thousand praised 
the lord with the instruments which i made said david to praise 
therewith 
and david divided them into courses among the sons of levi 
namely gershon kohath and merari 
of the gershonites were laadan and shimei 
the sons of laadan the chief was jehiel and zetham and joel 
three 
the sons of shimei shelomith and haziel and haran three 
these were the chief of the fathers of laadan 
and the sons of shimei were jahath zina and jeush and 
beriah 
these four were the sons of shimei 
and jahath was the chief and zizah the second but jeush and 
beriah had not many sons therefore they were in one reckoning 
according to their father s house 
the sons of kohath amram izhar hebron and uzziel four 
the sons of amram aaron and moses and aaron was separated 
that he should sanctify the most holy things he and his sons for 
ever to burn incense before the lord to minister unto him and to 
bless in his name for ever 
now concerning moses the man of god his sons were named of the 
tribe of levi 
the sons of moses were gershom and eliezer 
of the sons of gershom shebuel was the chief 
and the sons of eliezer were rehabiah the chief and eliezer 
had none other sons but the sons of rehabiah were very many 
of the sons of izhar shelomith the chief 
of the sons of hebron jeriah the first amariah the second 
jahaziel the third and jekameam the fourth 
of the sons of uzziel micah the first and jesiah the second 
the sons of merari mahli and mushi the sons of mahli 
eleazar and kish 
and eleazar died and had no sons but daughters and their 
brethren the sons of kish took them 
the sons of mushi mahli and eder and jeremoth three 
these were the sons of levi after the house of their fathers 
even the chief of the fathers as they were counted by number of names 
by their polls that did the work for the service of the house of the 
lord from the age of twenty years and upward 
for david said the lord god of israel hath given rest unto his 
people that they may dwell in jerusalem for ever and also unto 
the levites they shall no more carry the tabernacle nor any vessels 
of it for the service thereof 
for by the last words of david the levites were numbered from 
twenty years old and above because their office was to wait on 
the sons of aaron for the service of the house of the lord in the 
courts and in the chambers and in the purifying of all holy things 
and the work of the service of the house of god both for the 
shewbread and for the fine flour for meat offering and for the 
unleavened cakes and for that which is baked in the pan and for that 
which is fried and for all manner of measure and size and to 
stand every morning to thank and praise the lord and likewise at 
even and to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the lord in the 
sabbaths in the new moons and on the set feasts by number 
according to the order commanded unto them continually before the 
lord and that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of 
the congregation and the charge of the holy place and the charge of 
the sons of aaron their brethren in the service of the house of the 
lord 
now these are the divisions of the sons of aaron the sons of 
aaron nadab and abihu eleazar and ithamar 
but nadab and abihu died before their father and had no 
children therefore eleazar and ithamar executed the priest s office 
and david distributed them both zadok of the sons of eleazar 
and ahimelech of the sons of ithamar according to their offices in 
their service 
and there were more chief men found of the sons of eleazar than 
of the sons of ithamar and thus were they divided among the sons of 
eleazar there were sixteen chief men of the house of their fathers 
and eight among the sons of ithamar according to the house of their 
fathers 
thus were they divided by lot one sort with another for the 
governors of the sanctuary and governors of the house of god were of 
the sons of eleazar and of the sons of ithamar 
and shemaiah the son of nethaneel the scribe one of the levites 
wrote them before the king and the princes and zadok the priest and 
ahimelech the son of abiathar and before the chief of the fathers of 
the priests and levites one principal household being taken for 
eleazar and one taken for ithamar 
now the first lot came forth to jehoiarib the second to jedaiah 
the third to harim the fourth to seorim the fifth to 
malchijah the sixth to mijamin the seventh to hakkoz the 
eighth to abijah the ninth to jeshuah the tenth to shecaniah 
the eleventh to eliashib the twelfth to jakim the 
thirteenth to huppah the fourteenth to jeshebeab the fifteenth 
to bilgah the sixteenth to immer the seventeenth to hezir the 
eighteenth to aphses the nineteenth to pethahiah the twentieth 
to jehezekel the one and twentieth to jachin the two and 
twentieth to gamul the three and twentieth to delaiah the four 
and twentieth to maaziah 
these were the orderings of them in their service to come into 
the house of the lord according to their manner under aaron their 
father as the lord god of israel had commanded him 
and the rest of the sons of levi were these of the sons of 
amram shubael of the sons of shubael jehdeiah 
concerning rehabiah of the sons of rehabiah the first was 
isshiah 
of the izharites shelomoth of the sons of shelomoth jahath 
and the sons of hebron jeriah the first amariah the second 
jahaziel the third jekameam the fourth 
of the sons of uzziel michah of the sons of michah shamir 
the brother of michah was isshiah of the sons of isshiah 
zechariah 
the sons of merari were mahli and mushi the sons of jaaziah 
beno 
the sons of merari by jaaziah beno and shoham and zaccur and 
ibri 
of mahli came eleazar who had no sons 
concerning kish the son of kish was jerahmeel 
the sons also of mushi mahli and eder and jerimoth these 
were the sons of the levites after the house of their fathers 
these likewise cast lots over against their brethren the sons of 
aaron in the presence of david the king and zadok and ahimelech and 
the chief of the fathers of the priests and levites even the 
principal fathers over against their younger brethren 
moreover david and the captains of the host separated to the 
service of the sons of asaph and of heman and of jeduthun who 
should prophesy with harps with psalteries and with cymbals and the 
number of the workmen according to their service was of the sons 
of asaph zaccur and joseph and nethaniah and asarelah the sons of 
asaph under the hands of asaph which prophesied according to the 
order of the king 
of jeduthun the sons of jeduthun gedaliah and zeri and 
jeshaiah hashabiah and mattithiah six under the hands of their 
father jeduthun who prophesied with a harp to give thanks and to 
praise the lord 
of heman the sons of heman bukkiah mattaniah uzziel shebuel 
and jerimoth hananiah hanani eliathah giddalti and romamtiezer 
joshbekashah mallothi hothir and mahazioth all these were the 
sons of heman the king s seer in the words of god to lift up the 
horn and god gave to heman fourteen sons and three daughters 
all these were under the hands of their father for song in the 
house of the lord with cymbals psalteries and harps for the 
service of the house of god according to the king s order to asaph 
jeduthun and heman 
so the number of them with their brethren that were instructed 
in the songs of the lord even all that were cunning was two hundred 
fourscore and eight 
and they cast lots ward against ward as well the small as the 
great the teacher as the scholar 
now the first lot came forth for asaph to joseph the second to 
gedaliah who with his brethren and sons were twelve the third 
to zaccur he his sons and his brethren were twelve the 
fourth to izri he his sons and his brethren were twelve the 
fifth to nethaniah he his sons and his brethren were twelve

concerning the divisions of the porters of the korhites was 
meshelemiah the son of kore of the sons of asaph 
and the sons of meshelemiah were zechariah the firstborn 
jediael the second zebadiah the third jathniel the fourth elam 
the fifth jehohanan the sixth elioenai the seventh 
moreover the sons of obededom were shemaiah the firstborn 
jehozabad the second joah the third and sacar the fourth and 
nethaneel the fifth 
ammiel the sixth issachar the seventh peulthai the eighth for 
god blessed him 
also unto shemaiah his son were sons born that ruled throughout 
the house of their father for they were mighty men of valour 
the sons of shemaiah othni and rephael and obed elzabad 
whose brethren were strong men elihu and semachiah 
all these of the sons of obededom they and their sons and their 
brethren able men for strength for the service were threescore and

chief for though he was not the firstborn yet his father made him 
the chief hilkiah the second tebaliah the third zechariah 
the fourth all the sons and brethren of hosah were thirteen 
among these were the divisions of the porters even among the 
chief men having wards one against another to minister in the house 
of the lord 
and they cast lots as well the small as the great according to 
the house of their fathers for every gate 
and the lot eastward fell to shelemiah then for zechariah his 
son a wise counsellor they cast lots and his lot came out 
northward

but david took not the number of them from twenty years old and 
under because the lord had said he would increase israel like to the 
stars of the heavens 
joab the son of zeruiah began to number but he finished not 
because there fell wrath for it against israel neither was the number 
put in the account of the chronicles of king david

by course and the captains over the thousands and captains over the 
hundreds and the stewards over all the substance and possession of 
the king and of his sons with the officers and with the mighty men 
and with all the valiant men unto jerusalem 
then david the king stood up upon his feet and said hear me my 
brethren and my people as for me i had in mine heart to build an 
house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the lord and for the 
footstool of our god and had made ready for the building but 
god said unto me thou shalt not build an house for my name because 
thou hast been a man of war and hast she would blood 
howbeit the lord god of israel chose me before all the house of 
my father to be king over israel for ever for he hath chosen judah to 
be the ruler and of the house of judah the house of my father and 
among the sons of my father he liked me to make me king over all 
israel and of all my sons for the lord hath given me many 
sons he hath chosen solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the 
kingdom of the lord over israel 
and he said unto me solomon thy son he shall build my house and 
my courts for i have chosen him to be my son and i will be his 
father 
moreover i will establish his kingdom for ever if he be constant 
to do my commandments and my judgments as at this day 
now therefore in the sight of all israel the congregation of the 
lord and in the audience of our god keep and seek for all the 
commandments of the lord your god that ye may possess this good land 
and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you for ever 
and thou solomon my son know thou the god of thy father and 
serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind for the lord 
searcheth all hearts and understandeth all the imaginations of the 
thoughts if thou seek him he will be found of thee but if thou 
forsake him he will cast thee off for ever 
take heed now for the lord hath chosen thee to build an house 
for the sanctuary be strong and do it 
then david gave to solomon his son the pattern of the porch and 
of the houses thereof and of the treasuries thereof and of the upper 
chambers thereof and of the inner parlours thereof and of the place 
of the mercy seat and the pattern of all that he had by the 
spirit of the courts of the house of the lord and of all the 
chambers round about of the treasuries of the house of god and of 
the treasuries of the dedicated things also for the courses of 
the priests and the levites and for all the work of the service of 
the house of the lord and for all the vessels of service in the house 
of the lord 
he gave of gold by weight for things of gold for all 
instruments of all manner of service silver also for all instruments 
of silver by weight for all instruments of every kind of service 
even the weight for the candlesticks of gold and for their 
lamps of gold by weight for every candlestick and for the lamps 
thereof and for the candlesticks of silver by weight both for the 
candlestick and also for the lamps thereof according to the use of 
every candlestick 
and by weight he gave gold for the tables of shewbread for 
every table and likewise silver for the tables of silver also 
pure gold for the fleshhooks and the bowls and the cups and for the 
golden basons he gave gold by weight for every bason and likewise 
silver by weight for every bason of silver and for the altar of 
incense refined gold by weight and gold for the pattern of the 
chariot of the cherubims that spread out their wings and covered the 
ark of the covenant of the lord 
all this said david the lord made me understand in writing by 
his hand upon me even all the works of this pattern 
and david said to solomon his son be strong and of good 
courage and do it fear not nor be dismayed for the lord god even 
my god will be with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee 
until thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of 
the lord 
and behold the courses of the priests and the levites even 
they shall be with thee for all the service of the house of god and 
there shall be with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing 
skilful man for any manner of service also the princes and all the 
people will be wholly at thy commandment 
furthermore david the king said unto all the congregation 
solomon my son whom alone god hath chosen is yet young and tender 
and the work is great for the palace is not for man but for the lord 
god 
now i have prepared with all my might for the house of my god the 
gold for things to be made of gold and the silver for things of 
silver and the brass for things of brass the iron for things of 
iron and wood for things of wood onyx stones and stones to be set 
glistering stones and of divers colours and all manner of precious 
stones and marble stones in abundance 
moreover because i have set my affection to the house of my god 
i have of mine own proper good of gold and silver which i have given 
to the house of my god over and above all that i have prepared for 
the holy house 
even three thousand talents of gold of the gold of ophir and 
seven thousand talents of refined silver to overlay the walls of the 
houses withal the gold for things of gold and the silver for 
things of silver and for all manner of work to be made by the hands 
of artificers and who then is willing to consecrate his service this 
day unto the lord then the chief of the fathers and princes of 
the tribes of israel and the captains of thousands and of hundreds 
with the rulers of the king s work offered willingly and gave 
for the service of the house of god of gold five thousand talents and 
ten thousand drams and of silver ten thousand talents and of brass 
eighteen thousand talents and one hundred thousand talents of iron 
and they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the 
treasure of the house of the lord by the hand of jehiel the 
gershonite 
then the people rejoiced for that they offered willingly 
because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the lord and 
david the king also rejoiced with great joy 
wherefore david blessed the lord before all the congregation 
and david said blessed be thou lord god of israel our father for 
ever and ever 
thine o lord is the greatness and the power and the glory 
and the victory and the majesty for all that is in the heaven and in 
the earth is thine thine is the kingdom o lord and thou art exalted 
as head above all 
both riches and honour come of thee and thou reignest over all 
and in thine hand is power and might and in thine hand it is to make 
great and to give strength unto all 
now therefore our god we thank thee and praise thy glorious 
name 
but who am i and what is my people that we should be able to 
offer so willingly after this sort for all things come of thee and 
of thine own have we given thee 
for we are strangers before thee and sojourners as were all 
our fathers our days on the earth are as a shadow and there is none 
abiding 
o lord our god all this store that we have prepared to build 
thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand and is all 
thine own 
i know also my god that thou triest the heart and hast 
pleasure in uprightness as for me in the uprightness of mine heart i 
have willingly offered all these things and now have i seen with joy 
thy people which are present here to offer willingly unto thee 
o lord god of abraham isaac and of israel our fathers keep 
this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy 
people and prepare their heart unto thee and give unto solomon 
my son a perfect heart to keep thy commandments thy testimonies and 
thy statutes and to do all these things and to build the palace for 
the which i have made provision 
and david said to all the congregation now bless the lord your 
god 
and all the congregation blessed the lord god of their fathers and 
bowed down their heads and worshipped the lord and the king 
and they sacrificed sacrifices unto the lord and offered burnt 
offerings unto the lord on the morrow after that day even a thousand 
bullocks a thousand rams and a thousand lambs with their drink 
offerings and sacrifices in abundance for all israel and did 
eat and drink before the lord on that day with great gladness and 
they made solomon the son of david king the second time and anointed 
him unto the lord to be the chief governor and zadok to be priest 
then solomon sat on the throne of the lord as king instead of 
david his father and prospered and all israel obeyed him 
and all the princes and the mighty men and all the sons 
likewise of king david submitted themselves unto solomon the king 
and the lord magnified solomon exceedingly in the sight of all 
israel and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on 
any king before him in israel 
thus david the son of jesse reigned over all israel 
and the time that he reigned over israel was forty years seven 
years reigned he in hebron and thirty and three years reigned he in 
jerusalem 
and he died in a good old age full of days riches and honour 
and solomon his son reigned in his stead 
now the acts of david the king first and last behold they are 
written in the book of samuel the seer and in the book of nathan the 
prophet and in the book of gad the seer with all his reign and 
his might and the times that went over him and over israel and over 
all the kingdoms of the countries 
the second book of the chronicles 
and solomon the son of david was strengthened in his kingdom and 
the lord his god was with him and magnified him exceedingly 
then solomon spake unto all israel to the captains of thousands 
and of hundreds and to the judges and to every governor in all 
israel the chief of the fathers 
so solomon and all the congregation with him went to the high 
place that was at gibeon for there was the tabernacle of the 
congregation of god which moses the servant of the lord had made in 
the wilderness 
but the ark of god had david brought up from kirjathjearim to the 
place which david had prepared for it for he had pitched a tent for 
it at jerusalem 
moreover the brasen altar that bezaleel the son of uri the son 
of hur had made he put before the tabernacle of the lord and 
solomon and the congregation sought unto it 
and solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the lord 
which was at the tabernacle of the congregation and offered a 
thousand burnt offerings upon it 
in that night did god appear unto solomon and said unto him ask 
what i shall give thee 
and solomon said unto god thou hast shewed great mercy unto david 
my father and hast made me to reign in his stead 
now o lord god let thy promise unto david my father be 
established for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of 
the earth in multitude 
give me now wisdom and knowledge that i may go out and come in 
before this people for who can judge this thy people that is so 
great and god said to solomon because this was in thine heart 
and thou hast not asked riches wealth or honour nor the life of 
thine enemies neither yet hast asked long life but hast asked wisdom 
and knowledge for thyself that thou mayest judge my people over whom 
i have made thee king wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee 
and i will give thee riches and wealth and honour such as none of 
the kings have had that have been before thee neither shall there any 
after thee have the like 
then solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at 
gibeon to jerusalem from before the tabernacle of the congregation 
and reigned over israel 
and solomon gathered chariots and horsemen and he had a thousand 
and four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen which he 
placed in the chariot cities and with the king at jerusalem 
and the king made silver and gold at jerusalem as plenteous as 
stones and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the 
vale for abundance 
and solomon had horses brought out of egypt and linen yarn the 
king s merchants received the linen yarn at a price 
and they fetched up and brought forth out of egypt a chariot for 
six hundred shekels of silver and an horse for an hundred and fifty 
and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the hittites and 
for the kings of syria by their means 
and solomon determined to build an house for the name of the lord 
and an house for his kingdom 
and solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear 
burdens and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain and three 
thousand and six hundred to oversee them 
and solomon sent to huram the king of tyre saying as thou didst 
deal with david my father and didst send him cedars to build him an 
house to dwell therein even so deal with me 
behold i build an house to the name of the lord my god to 
dedicate it to him and to burn before him sweet incense and for the 
continual shewbread and for the burnt offerings morning and evening 
on the sabbaths and on the new moons and on the solemn feasts of the 
lord our god this is an ordinance for ever to israel 
and the house which i build is great for great is our god above 
all gods 
but who is able to build him an house seeing the heaven and 
heaven of heavens cannot contain him who am i then that i should 
build him an house save only to burn sacrifice before him send 
me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold and in silver and in 
brass and in iron and in purple and crimson and blue and that can 
skill to grave with the cunning men that are with me in judah and in 
jerusalem whom david my father did provide 
send me also cedar trees fir trees and algum trees out of 
lebanon for i know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in 
lebanon and behold my servants shall be with thy servants even 
to prepare me timber in abundance for the house which i am about to 
build shall be wonderful great 
and behold i will give to thy servants the hewers that cut 
timber twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat and twenty thousand 
measures of barley and twenty thousand baths of wine and twenty 
thousand baths of oil 
then huram the king of tyre answered in writing which he sent to 
solomon because the lord hath loved his people he hath made thee 
king over them 
huram said moreover blessed be the lord god of israel that made 
heaven and earth who hath given to david the king a wise son endued 
with prudence and understanding that might build an house for the 
lord and an house for his kingdom 
and now i have sent a cunning man endued with understanding of 
huram my father s the son of a woman of the daughters of dan 
and his father was a man of tyre skilful to work in gold and in 
silver in brass in iron in stone and in timber in purple in 
blue and in fine linen and in crimson also to grave any manner of 
graving and to find out every device which shall be put to him with 
thy cunning men and with the cunning men of my lord david thy father 
now therefore the wheat and the barley the oil and the wine 
which my lord hath spoken of let him send unto his servants and 
we will cut wood out of lebanon as much as thou shalt need and we 
will bring it to thee in floats by sea to joppa and thou shalt carry 
it up to jerusalem 
and solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of 
israel after the numbering wherewith david his father had numbered 
them and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three 
thousand and six hundred 
and he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers of 
burdens and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the mountain and 
three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people a work 
then solomon began to build the house of the lord at jerusalem in 
mount moriah where the lord appeared unto david his father in the 
place that david had prepared in the threshingfloor of ornan the 
jebusite 
and he began to build in the second day of the second month in 
the fourth year of his reign 
now these are the things wherein solomon was instructed for the 
building of the house of god the length by cubits after the first 
measure was threescore cubits and the breadth twenty cubits 
and the porch that was in the front of the house the length of it 
was according to the breadth of the house twenty cubits and the 
height was an hundred and twenty and he overlaid it within with pure 
gold 
and the greater house he cieled with fir tree which he overlaid 
with fine gold and set thereon palm trees and chains 
and he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty and 
the gold was gold of parvaim 
he overlaid also the house the beams the posts and the walls 
thereof and the doors thereof with gold and graved cherubims on the 
walls 
and he made the most holy house the length whereof was according 
to the breadth of the house twenty cubits and the breadth thereof 
twenty cubits and he overlaid it with fine gold amounting to six 
hundred talents 
and the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold and he 
overlaid the upper chambers with gold 
and in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work 
and overlaid them with gold 
and the wings of the cherubims were twenty cubits long one wing 
of the one cherub was five cubits reaching to the wall of the house 
and the other wing was likewise five cubits reaching to the wing of 
the other cherub 
and one wing of the other cherub was five cubits reaching to the 
wall of the house and the other wing was five cubits also joining to 
the wing of the other cherub 
the wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty 
cubits and they stood on their feet and their faces were inward 
and he made the vail of blue and purple and crimson and fine 
linen and wrought cherubims thereon 
also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five 
cubits high and the chapiter that was on the top of each of them was 
five cubits 
and he made chains as in the oracle and put them on the heads 
of the pillars and made an hundred pomegranates and put them on the 
chains 
and he reared up the pillars before the temple one on the right 
hand and the other on the left and called the name of that on the 
right hand jachin and the name of that on the left boaz 
moreover he made an altar of brass twenty cubits the length 
thereof and twenty cubits the breadth thereof and ten cubits the 
height thereof 
also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim round 
in compass and five cubits the height thereof and a line of thirty 
cubits did compass it round about 
and under it was the similitude of oxen which did compass it 
round about ten in a cubit compassing the sea round about two rows 
of oxen were cast when it was cast 
it stood upon twelve oxen three looking toward the north and 
three looking toward the west and three looking toward the south and 
three looking toward the east and the sea was set above upon them 
and all their hinder parts were inward 
and the thickness of it was an handbreadth and the brim of it 
like the work of the brim of a cup with flowers of lilies and it 
received and held three thousand baths 
he made also ten lavers and put five on the right hand and five 
on the left to wash in them such things as they offered for the 
burnt offering they washed in them but the sea was for the priests to 
wash in 
and he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form and 
set them in the temple five on the right hand and five on the left 
he made also ten tables and placed them in the temple five on 
the right side and five on the left and he made an hundred basons of 
gold 
furthermore he made the court of the priests and the great court 
and doors for the court and overlaid the doors of them with brass 
and he set the sea on the right side of the east end over 
against the south 
and huram made the pots and the shovels and the basons and 
huram finished the work that he was to make for king solomon for the 
house of god to wit the two pillars and the pommels and the 
chapiters which were on the top of the two pillars and the two 
wreaths to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were on the 
top of the pillars and four hundred pomegranates on the two 
wreaths two rows of pomegranates on each wreath to cover the two 
pommels of the chapiters which were upon the pillars 
he made also bases and lavers made he upon the bases one 
sea and twelve oxen under it 
the pots also and the shovels and the fleshhooks and all their 
instruments did huram his father make to king solomon for the house 
of the lord of bright brass 
in the plain of jordan did the king cast them in the clay ground 
between succoth and zeredathah 
thus solomon made all these vessels in great abundance for the 
weight of the brass could not be found out 
and solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of god 
the golden altar also and the tables whereon the shewbread was set 
moreover the candlesticks with their lamps that they should burn 
after the manner before the oracle of pure gold and the 
flowers and the lamps and the tongs made he of gold and that 
perfect gold and the snuffers and the basons and the spoons 
and the censers of pure gold and the entry of the house the inner 
doors thereof for the most holy place and the doors of the house of 
the temple were of gold 
thus all the work that solomon made for the house of the lord was 
finished and solomon brought in all the things that david his father 
had dedicated and the silver and the gold and all the instruments 
put he among the treasures of the house of god 
then solomon assembled the elders of israel and all the heads of 
the tribes the chief of the fathers of the children of israel unto 
jerusalem to bring up the ark of the covenant of the lord out of the 
city of david which is zion 
wherefore all the men of israel assembled themselves unto the king 
in the feast which was in the seventh month 
and all the elders of israel came and the levites took up the 
ark 
and they brought up the ark and the tabernacle of the 
congregation and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle 
these did the priests and the levites bring up 
also king solomon and all the congregation of israel that were 
assembled unto him before the ark sacrificed sheep and oxen which 
could not be told nor numbered for multitude 
and the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the lord 
unto his place to the oracle of the house into the most holy place 
even under the wings of the cherubims for the cherubims spread 
forth their wings over the place of the ark and the cherubims covered 
the ark and the staves thereof above 
and they drew out the staves of the ark that the ends of the 
staves were seen from the ark before the oracle but they were not 
seen without and there it is unto this day 
there was nothing in the ark save the two tables which moses put 
therein at horeb when the lord made a covenant with the children of 
israel when they came out of egypt 
and it came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy 
place for all the priests that were present were sanctified and did 
not then wait by course also the levites which were the singers 
all of them of asaph of heman of jeduthun with their sons and their 
brethren being arrayed in white linen having cymbals and psalteries 
and harps stood at the east end of the altar and with them an 
hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets it came even 
to pass as the trumpeters and singers were as one to make one sound 
to be heard in praising and thanking the lord and when they lifted up 
their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick 
and praised the lord saying for he is good for his mercy endureth 
for ever that then the house was filled with a cloud even the house 
of the lord so that the priests could not stand to minister by 
reason of the cloud for the glory of the lord had filled the house of 
god 
then said solomon the lord hath said that he would dwell in the 
thick darkness 
but i have built an house of habitation for thee and a place for 
thy dwelling for ever 
and the king turned his face and blessed the whole congregation 
of israel and all the congregation of israel stood 
and he said blessed be the lord god of israel who hath with his 
hands fulfilled that which he spake with his mouth to my father david 
saying since the day that i brought forth my people out of the 
land of egypt i chose no city among all the tribes of israel to build 
an house in that my name might be there neither chose i any man to 
be a ruler over my people israel but i have chosen jerusalem 
that my name might be there and have chosen david to be over my 
people israel 
now it was in the heart of david my father to build an house for 
the name of the lord god of israel 
but the lord said to david my father forasmuch as it was in thine 
heart to build an house for my name thou didst well in that it was in 
thine heart notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house but 
thy son which shall come forth out of thy loins he shall build the 
house for my name 
the lord therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken 
for i am risen up in the room of david my father and am set on the 
throne of israel as the lord promised and have built the house for 
the name of the lord god of israel 
and in it have i put the ark wherein is the covenant of the 
lord that he made with the children of israel 
and he stood before the altar of the lord in the presence of all 
the congregation of israel and spread forth his hands for 
solomon had made a brasen scaffold of five cubits long and five 
cubits broad and three cubits high and had set it in the midst of 
the court and upon it he stood and kneeled down upon his knees 
before all the congregation of israel and spread forth his hands 
toward heaven 
and said o lord god of israel there is no god like thee in the 
heaven nor in the earth which keepest covenant and shewest mercy 
unto thy servants that walk before thee with all their hearts 
thou which hast kept with thy servant david my father that which thou 
hast promised him and spakest with thy mouth and hast fulfilled it 
with thine hand as it is this day 
now therefore o lord god of israel keep with thy servant david 
my father that which thou hast promised him saying there shall not 
fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the throne of israel yet so 
that thy children take heed to their way to walk in my law as thou 
hast walked before me 
now then o lord god of israel let thy word be verified which 
thou hast spoken unto thy servant david 
but will god in very deed dwell with men on the earth behold 
heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee how much less 
this house which i have built have respect therefore to the 
prayer of thy servant and to his supplication o lord my god to 
hearken unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before 
thee that thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night 
upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name 
there to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward 
this place 
hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant and of 
thy people israel which they shall make toward this place hear thou 
from thy dwelling place even from heaven and when thou hearest 
forgive 
if a man sin against his neighbour and an oath be laid upon him 
to make him swear and the oath come before thine altar in this house 
then hear thou from heaven and do and judge thy servants by 
requiting the wicked by recompensing his way upon his own head and 
by justifying the righteous by giving him according to his 
righteousness 
and if thy people israel be put to the worse before the enemy 
because they have sinned against thee and shall return and confess 
thy name and pray and make supplication before thee in this house 
then hear thou from the heavens and forgive the sin of thy 
people israel and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to 
them and to their fathers 
when the heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they 
have sinned against thee yet if they pray toward this place and 
confess thy name and turn from their sin when thou dost afflict 
them then hear thou from heaven and forgive the sin of thy 
servants and of thy people israel when thou hast taught them the 
good way wherein they should walk and send rain upon thy land which 
thou hast given unto thy people for an inheritance 
if there be dearth in the land if there be pestilence if there 
be blasting or mildew locusts or caterpillers if their enemies 
besiege them in the cities of their land whatsoever sore or 
whatsoever sickness there be then what prayer or what 
supplication soever shall be made of any man or of all thy people 
israel when every one shall know his own sore and his own grief and 
shall spread forth his hands in this house then hear thou from 
heaven thy dwelling place and forgive and render unto every man 
according unto all his ways whose heart thou knowest for thou only 
knowest the hearts of the children of men that they may fear 
thee to walk in thy ways so long as they live in the land which thou 
gavest unto our fathers 
moreover concerning the stranger which is not of thy people 
israel but is come from a far country for thy great name s sake and 
thy mighty hand and thy stretched out arm if they come and pray in 
this house then hear thou from the heavens even from thy 
dwelling place and do according to all that the stranger calleth to 
thee for that all people of the earth may know thy name and fear 
thee as doth thy people israel and may know that this house which i 
have built is called by thy name 
if thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that 
thou shalt send them and they pray unto thee toward this city which 
thou hast chosen and the house which i have built for thy name 
then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their supplication 
and maintain their because 
if they sin against thee for there is no man which sinneth 
not and thou be angry with them and deliver them over before their 
enemies and they carry them away captives unto a land far off or 
near yet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they are 
carried captive and turn and pray unto thee in the land of their 
captivity saying we have sinned we have done amiss and have dealt 
wickedly if they return to thee with all their heart and with 
all their soul in the land of their captivity whither they have 
carried them captives and pray toward their land which thou gavest 
unto their fathers and toward the city which thou hast chosen and 
toward the house which i have built for thy name then hear thou 
from the heavens even from thy dwelling place their prayer and their 
supplications and maintain their because and forgive thy people which 
have sinned against thee 
now my god let i beseech thee thine eyes be open and let 
thine ears be attent unto the prayer that is made in this place 
now therefore arise o lord god into thy resting place thou 
and the ark of thy strength let thy priests o lord god be clothed 
with salvation and let thy saints rejoice in goodness 
o lord god turn not away the face of thine anointed remember 
the mercies of david thy servant 
now when solomon had made an end of praying the fire came down 
from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices and 
the glory of the lord filled the house 
and the priests could not enter into the house of the lord 
because the glory of the lord had filled the lord s house 
and when all the children of israel saw how the fire came down 
and the glory of the lord upon the house they bowed themselves with 
their faces to the ground upon the pavement and worshipped and 
praised the lord saying for he is good for his mercy endureth for 
ever 
then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the 
lord 
and king solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand 
oxen and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep so the king and all 
the people dedicated the house of god 
and the priests waited on their offices the levites also with 
instruments of musick of the lord which david the king had made to 
praise the lord because his mercy endureth for ever when david 
praised by their ministry and the priests sounded trumpets before 
them and all israel stood 
moreover solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before 
the house of the lord for there he offered burnt offerings and the 
fat of the peace offerings because the brasen altar which solomon had 
made was not able to receive the burnt offerings and the meat 
offerings and the fat 
also at the same time solomon kept the feast seven days and all 
israel with him a very great congregation from the entering in of 
hamath unto the river of egypt 
and in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly for they kept 
the dedication of the altar seven days and the feast seven days 
and on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent 
the people away into their tents glad and merry in heart for the 
goodness that the lord had shewed unto david and to solomon and to 
israel his people 
thus solomon finished the house of the lord and the king s 
house and all that came into solomon s heart to make in the house of 
the lord and in his own house he prosperously effected 
and the lord appeared to solomon by night and said unto him i 
have heard thy prayer and have chosen this place to myself for an 
house of sacrifice 
if i shut up heaven that there be no rain or if i command the 
locusts to devour the land or if i send pestilence among my people 
if my people which are called by my name shall humble 
themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked 
ways then will i hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and 
will heal their land 
now mine eyes shall be open and mine ears attent unto the prayer 
that is made in this place 
for now have i chosen and sanctified this house that my name may 
be there for ever and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there 
perpetually 
and as for thee if thou wilt walk before me as david thy father 
walked and do according to all that i have commanded thee and shalt 
observe my statutes and my judgments then will i stablish the 
throne of thy kingdom according as i have covenanted with david thy 
father saying there shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in israel 
but if ye turn away and forsake my statutes and my commandments 
which i have set before you and shall go and serve other gods and 
worship them then will i pluck them up by the roots out of my 
land which i have given them and this house which i have sanctified 
for my name will i cast out of my sight and will make it to be a 
proverb and a byword among all nations 
and this house which is high shall be an astonishment to every 
one that passeth by it so that he shall say why hath the lord done 
thus unto this land and unto this house and it shall be 
answered because they forsook the lord god of their fathers which 
brought them forth out of the land of egypt and laid hold on other 
gods and worshipped them and served them therefore hath he brought 
all this evil upon them 
and it came to pass at the end of twenty years wherein solomon 
had built the house of the lord and his own house that the 
cities which huram had restored to solomon solomon built them and 
caused the children of israel to dwell there 
and solomon went to hamathzobah and prevailed against it 
and he built tadmor in the wilderness and all the store cities 
which he built in hamath 
also he built bethhoron the upper and bethhoron the nether 
fenced cities with walls gates and bars and baalath and all 
the store cities that solomon had and all the chariot cities and the 
cities of the horsemen and all that solomon desired to build in 
jerusalem and in lebanon and throughout all the land of his 
dominion 
as for all the people that were left of the hittites and the 
amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites 
which were not of israel but of their children who were left 
after them in the land whom the children of israel consumed not them 
did solomon make to pay tribute until this day 
but of the children of israel did solomon make no servants for his 
work but they were men of war and chief of his captains and 
captains of his chariots and horsemen 
and these were the chief of king solomon s officers even two 
hundred and fifty that bare rule over the people 
and solomon brought up the daughter of pharaoh out of the city of 
david unto the house that he had built for her for he said my wife 
shall not dwell in the house of david king of israel because the 
places are holy whereunto the ark of the lord hath come 
then solomon offered burnt offerings unto the lord on the altar 
of the lord which he had built before the porch even after a 
certain rate every day offering according to the commandment of 
moses on the sabbaths and on the new moons and on the solemn 
feasts three times in the year even in the feast of unleavened 
bread and in the feast of weeks and in the feast of tabernacles 
and he appointed according to the order of david his father the 
courses of the priests to their service and the levites to their 
charges to praise and minister before the priests as the duty of 
every day required the porters also by their courses at every gate 
for so had david the man of god commanded 
and they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the 
priests and levites concerning any matter or concerning the 
treasures 
now all the work of solomon was prepared unto the day of the 
foundation of the house of the lord and until it was finished so the 
house of the lord was perfected 
then went solomon to eziongeber and to eloth at the sea side in 
the land of edom 
and huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships and 
servants that had knowledge of the sea and they went with the 
servants of solomon to ophir and took thence four hundred and fifty 
talents of gold and brought them to king solomon 
and when the queen of sheba heard of the fame of solomon she came 
to prove solomon with hard questions at jerusalem with a very great 
company and camels that bare spices and gold in abundance and 
precious stones and when she was come to solomon she communed with 
him of all that was in her heart 
and solomon told her all her questions and there was nothing hid 
from solomon which he told her not 
and when the queen of sheba had seen the wisdom of solomon and 
the house that he had built and the meat of his table and the 
sitting of his servants and the attendance of his ministers and 
their apparel his cupbearers also and their apparel and his ascent 
by which he went up into the house of the lord there was no more 
spirit in her 
and she said to the king it was a true report which i heard in 
mine own land of thine acts and of thy wisdom howbeit i believed 
not their words until i came and mine eyes had seen it and behold 
the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me for thou 
exceedest the fame that i heard 
happy are thy men and happy are these thy servants which stand 
continually before thee and hear thy wisdom 
blessed be the lord thy god which delighted in thee to set thee 
on his throne to be king for the lord thy god because thy god loved 
israel to establish them for ever therefore made he thee king over 
them to do judgment and justice 
and she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold and 
of spices great abundance and precious stones neither was there any 
such spice as the queen of sheba gave king solomon 
and the servants also of huram and the servants of solomon 
which brought gold from ophir brought algum trees and precious 
stones 
and the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of the 
lord and to the king s palace and harps and psalteries for singers 
and there were none such seen before in the land of judah 
and king solomon gave to the queen of sheba all her desire 
whatsoever she asked beside that which she had brought unto the king 
so she turned and went away to her own land she and her servants 
now the weight of gold that came to solomon in one year was six 
hundred and threescore and six talents of gold beside that which 
chapmen and merchants brought and all the kings of arabia and 
governors of the country brought gold and silver to solomon 
and king solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold six 
hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target 
and three hundred shields made he of beaten gold three hundred 
shekels of gold went to one shield and the king put them in the house 
of the forest of lebanon 
moreover the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it 
with pure gold 
and there were six steps to the throne with a footstool of gold 
which were fastened to the throne and stays on each side of the 
sitting place and two lions standing by the stays and twelve 
lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps 
there was not the like made in any kingdom 
and all the drinking vessels of king solomon were of gold and 
all the vessels of the house of the forest of lebanon were of pure 
gold none were of silver it was not any thing accounted of in the 
days of solomon 
for the king s ships went to tarshish with the servants of huram 
every three years once came the ships of tarshish bringing gold and 
silver ivory and apes and peacocks 
and king solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and 
wisdom 
and all the kings of the earth sought the presence of solomon to 
hear his wisdom that god had put in his heart 
and they brought every man his present vessels of silver and 
vessels of gold and raiment harness and spices horses and mules 
a rate year by year 
and solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots and 
twelve thousand horsemen whom he bestowed in the chariot cities and 
with the king at jerusalem 
and he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the 
land of the philistines and to the border of egypt 
and the king made silver in jerusalem as stones and cedar trees 
made he as the sycomore trees that are in the low plains in abundance 
and they brought unto solomon horses out of egypt and out of all 
lands 
now the rest of the acts of solomon first and last are they not 
written in the book of nathan the prophet and in the prophecy of 
ahijah the shilonite and in the visions of iddo the seer against 
jeroboam the son of nebat and solomon reigned in jerusalem over 
all israel forty years 
and solomon slept with his fathers and he was buried in the city 
of david his father and rehoboam his son reigned in his stead 
and rehoboam went to shechem for to shechem were all israel come 
to make him king 
and it came to pass when jeroboam the son of nebat who was in 
egypt whither he fled from the presence of solomon the king heard 
it that jeroboam returned out of egypt 
and they sent and called him so jeroboam and all israel came and 
spake to rehoboam saying thy father made our yoke grievous now 
therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father and 
his heavy yoke that he put upon us and we will serve thee 
and he said unto them come again unto me after three days and 
the people departed 
and king rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood 
before solomon his father while he yet lived saying what counsel 
give ye me to return answer to this people and they spake unto 
him saying if thou be kind to this people and please them and 
speak good words to them they will be thy servants for ever 
but he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him and took 
counsel with the young men that were brought up with him that stood 
before him 
and he said unto them what advice give ye that we may return 
answer to this people which have spoken to me saying ease somewhat 
the yoke that thy father did put upon us and the young men 
that were brought up with him spake unto him saying thus shalt thou 
answer the people that spake unto thee saying thy father made our 
yoke heavy but make thou it somewhat lighter for us thus shalt thou 
say unto them my little finger shall be thicker than my father s 
loins 
for whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you i will put more 
to your yoke my father chastised you with whips but i will chastise 
you with scorpions 
so jeroboam and all the people came to rehoboam on the third 
day as the king bade saying come again to me on the third day 
and the king answered them roughly and king rehoboam forsook 
the counsel of the old men and answered them after the advice 
of the young men saying my father made your yoke heavy but i will 
add thereto my father chastised you with whips but i will chastise 
you with scorpions 
so the king hearkened not unto the people for the because was of 
god that the lord might perform his word which he spake by the hand 
of ahijah the shilonite to jeroboam the son of nebat 
and when all israel saw that the king would not hearken unto 
them the people answered the king saying what portion have we in 
david and we have none inheritance in the son of jesse every man to 
your tents o israel and now david see to thine own house so all 
israel went to their tents 
but as for the children of israel that dwelt in the cities of 
judah rehoboam reigned over them 
then king rehoboam sent hadoram that was over the tribute and 
the children of israel stoned him with stones that he died but king 
rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot to flee to 
jerusalem 
and israel rebelled against the house of david unto this day 
and when rehoboam was come to jerusalem he gathered of the house 
of judah and benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men 
which were warriors to fight against israel that he might bring the 
kingdom again to rehoboam 
but the word of the lord came to shemaiah the man of god saying 
speak unto rehoboam the son of solomon king of judah and to all 
israel in judah and benjamin saying thus saith the lord ye 
shall not go up nor fight against your brethren return every man to 
his house for this thing is done of me and they obeyed the words of 
the lord and returned from going against jeroboam 
and rehoboam dwelt in jerusalem and built cities for defence in 
judah 
he built even bethlehem and etam and tekoa and bethzur 
and shoco and adullam and gath and mareshah and ziph 
and adoraim and lachish and azekah and zorah and aijalon 
and hebron which are in judah and in benjamin fenced cities 
and he fortified the strong holds and put captains in them and 
store of victual and of oil and wine 
and in every several city he put shields and spears and made 
them exceeding strong having judah and benjamin on his side 
and the priests and the levites that were in all israel resorted 
to him out of all their coasts 
for the levites left their suburbs and their possession and 
came to judah and jerusalem for jeroboam and his sons had cast them 
off from executing the priest s office unto the lord and he 
ordained him priests for the high places and for the devils and for 
the calves which he had made 
and after them out of all the tribes of israel such as set their 
hearts to seek the lord god of israel came to jerusalem to sacrifice 
unto the lord god of their fathers 
so they strengthened the kingdom of judah and made rehoboam the 
son of solomon strong three years for three years they walked in the 
way of david and solomon 
and rehoboam took him mahalath the daughter of jerimoth the son 
of david to wife and abihail the daughter of eliab the son of jesse 
which bare him children jeush and shamariah and zaham 
and after her he took maachah the daughter of absalom which 
bare him abijah and attai and ziza and shelomith 
and rehoboam loved maachah the daughter of absalom above all his 
wives and his concubines for he took eighteen wives and threescore 
concubines and begat twenty and eight sons and threescore 
daughters and rehoboam made abijah the son of maachah the 
chief to be ruler among his brethren for he thought to make him 
king 
and he dealt wisely and dispersed of all his children 
throughout all the countries of judah and benjamin unto every fenced 
city and he gave them victual in abundance and he desired many 
wives 
and it came to pass when rehoboam had established the kingdom 
and had strengthened himself he forsook the law of the lord and all 
israel with him 
and it came to pass that in the fifth year of king rehoboam 
shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem because they had 
transgressed against the lord with twelve hundred chariots and 
threescore thousand horsemen and the people were without number that 
came with him out of egypt the lubims the sukkiims and the 
ethiopians 
and he took the fenced cities which pertained to judah and came 
to jerusalem 
then came shemaiah the prophet to rehoboam and to the princes of 
judah that were gathered together to jerusalem because of shishak 
and said unto them thus saith the lord ye have forsaken me and 
therefore have i also left you in the hand of shishak 
whereupon the princes of israel and the king humbled themselves 
and they said the lord is righteous 
and when the lord saw that they humbled themselves the word of 
the lord came to shemaiah saying they have humbled themselves 
therefore i will not destroy them but i will grant them some 
deliverance and my wrath shall not be poured out upon jerusalem by 
the hand of shishak 
nevertheless they shall be his servants that they may know my 
service and the service of the kingdoms of the countries 
so shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem and took away 
the treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of the 
king s house he took all he carried away also the shields of gold 
which solomon had made 
instead of which king rehoboam made shields of brass and 
committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard that kept the 
entrance of the king s house 
and when the king entered into the house of the lord the guard 
came and fetched them and brought them again into the guard chamber 
and when he humbled himself the wrath of the lord turned from 
him that he would not destroy him altogether and also in judah 
things went well 
so king rehoboam strengthened himself in jerusalem and reigned 
for rehoboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign and 
he reigned seventeen years in jerusalem the city which the lord had 
chosen out of all the tribes of israel to put his name there and his 
mother s name was naamah an ammonitess 
and he did evil because he prepared not his heart to seek the 
lord 
now the acts of rehoboam first and last are they not written 
in the book of shemaiah the prophet and of iddo the seer concerning 
genealogies and there were wars between rehoboam and jeroboam 
continually 
and rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried in the city 
of david and abijah his son reigned in his stead 
now in the eighteenth year of king jeroboam began abijah to reign 
over judah 
he reigned three years in jerusalem his mother s name also was 
michaiah the daughter of uriel of gibeah and there was war between 
abijah and jeroboam 
and abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of 
war even four hundred thousand chosen men jeroboam also set the 
battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men 
being mighty men of valour 
and abijah stood up upon mount zemaraim which is in mount 
ephraim and said hear me thou jeroboam and all israel ought 
ye not to know that the lord god of israel gave the kingdom over 
israel to david for ever even to him and to his sons by a covenant of 
salt yet jeroboam the son of nebat the servant of solomon the 
son of david is risen up and hath rebelled against his lord 
and there are gathered unto him vain men the children of belial 
and have strengthened themselves against rehoboam the son of solomon 
when rehoboam was young and tenderhearted and could not withstand 
them 
and now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the lord in the hand 
of the sons of david and ye be a great multitude and there are with 
your golden calves which jeroboam made you for gods 
have ye not cast out the priests of the lord the sons of aaron 
and the levites and have made you priests after the manner of the 
nations of other lands so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself 
with a young bullock and seven rams the same may be a priest of them 
that are no gods 
but as for us the lord is our god and we have not forsaken 
him and the priests which minister unto the lord are the sons of 
aaron and the levites wait upon their business and they burn 
unto the lord every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and 
sweet incense the shewbread also set they in order upon the pure 
table and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof to burn 
every evening for we keep the charge of the lord our god but ye have 
forsaken him 
and behold god himself is with us for our captain and his 
priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you o children of 
israel fight ye not against the lord god of your fathers for ye 
shall not prosper 
but jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them so 
they were before judah and the ambushment was behind them 
and when judah looked back behold the battle was before and 
behind and they cried unto the lord and the priests sounded with the 
trumpets 
then the men of judah gave a shout and as the men of judah 
shouted it came to pass that god smote jeroboam and all israel 
before abijah and judah 
and the children of israel fled before judah and god delivered 
them into their hand 
and abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter so 
there fell down slain of israel five hundred thousand chosen men 
thus the children of israel were brought under at that time and 
the children of judah prevailed because they relied upon the lord god 
of their fathers 
and abijah pursued after jeroboam and took cities from him 
bethel with the towns thereof and jeshanah with the towns thereof 
and ephraim with the towns thereof 
neither did jeroboam recover strength again in the days of 
abijah and the lord struck him and he died 
but abijah waxed mighty and married fourteen wives and begat 
twenty and two sons and sixteen daughters 
and the rest of the acts of abijah and his ways and his 
sayings are written in the story of the prophet iddo 
so abijah slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city 
of david and asa his son reigned in his stead in his days the land 
was quiet ten years 
and asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the lord 
his god for he took away the altars of the strange gods and the 
high places and brake down the images and cut down the groves 
and commanded judah to seek the lord god of their fathers and to do 
the law and the commandment 
also he took away out of all the cities of judah the high places 
and the images and the kingdom was quiet before him 
and he built fenced cities in judah for the land had rest and 
he had no war in those years because the lord had given him rest 
therefore he said unto judah let us build these cities and make 
about them walls and towers gates and bars while the land is yet 
before us because we have sought the lord our god we have sought 
him and he hath given us rest on every side so they built and 
prospered 
and asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears out of 
judah three hundred thousand and out of benjamin that bare shields 
and drew bows two hundred and fourscore thousand all these were 
mighty men of valour 
and there came out against them zerah the ethiopian with an host 
of a thousand thousand and three hundred chariots and came unto 
mareshah 
then asa went out against him and they set the battle in array 
in the valley of zephathah at mareshah 
and asa cried unto the lord his god and said lord it is 
nothing with thee to help whether with many or with them that have 
no power help us o lord our god for we rest on thee and in thy 
name we go against this multitude o lord thou art our god let no 
man prevail against thee 
so the lord smote the ethiopians before asa and before judah 
and the ethiopians fled 
and asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto 
gerar and the ethiopians were overthrown that they could not recover 
themselves for they were destroyed before the lord and before his 
host and they carried away very much spoil 
and they smote all the cities round about gerar for the fear of 
the lord came upon them and they spoiled all the cities for there 
was exceeding much spoil in them 
they smote also the tents of cattle and carried away sheep and 
camels in abundance and returned to jerusalem 
and the spirit of god came upon azariah the son of oded and 
he went out to meet asa and said unto him hear ye me asa and all 
judah and benjamin the lord is with you while ye be with him and if 
ye seek him he will be found of you but if ye forsake him he will 
forsake you 
now for a long season israel hath been without the true god and 
without a teaching priest and without law 
but when they in their trouble did turn unto the lord god of 
israel and sought him he was found of them 
and in those times there was no peace to him that went out nor 
to him that came in but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants 
of the countries 
and nation was destroyed of nation and city of city for god did 
vex them with all adversity 
be ye strong therefore and let not your hands be weak for your 
work shall be rewarded 
and when asa heard these words and the prophecy of oded the 
prophet he took courage and put away the abominable idols out of all 
the land of judah and benjamin and out of the cities which he had 
taken from mount ephraim and renewed the altar of the lord that was 
before the porch of the lord 
and he gathered all judah and benjamin and the strangers with 
them out of ephraim and manasseh and out of simeon for they fell to 
him out of israel in abundance when they saw that the lord his god 
was with him 
so they gathered themselves together at jerusalem in the third 
month in the fifteenth year of the reign of asa 
and they offered unto the lord the same time of the spoil which 
they had brought seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep 
and they entered into a covenant to seek the lord god of their 
fathers with all their heart and with all their soul that 
whosoever would not seek the lord god of israel should be put to 
death whether small or great whether man or woman 
and they sware unto the lord with a loud voice and with 
shouting and with trumpets and with cornets 
and all judah rejoiced at the oath for they had sworn with all 
their heart and sought him with their whole desire and he was found 
of them and the lord gave them rest round about 
and also concerning maachah the mother of asa the king he 
removed her from being queen because she had made an idol in a grove 
and asa cut down her idol and stamped it and burnt it at the brook 
kidron 
but the high places were not taken away out of israel 
nevertheless the heart of asa was perfect all his days 
and he brought into the house of god the things that his father 
had dedicated and that he himself had dedicated silver and gold 
and vessels 
and there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of 
the reign of asa 
in the six and thirtieth year of the reign of asa baasha king of 
israel came up against judah and built ramah to the intent that he 
might let none go out or come in to asa king of judah 
then asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the 
house of the lord and of the king s house and sent to benhadad king 
of syria that dwelt at damascus saying there is a league 
between me and thee as there was between my father and thy father 
behold i have sent thee silver and gold go break thy league with 
baasha king of israel that he may depart from me 
and benhadad hearkened unto king asa and sent the captains of 
his armies against the cities of israel and they smote ijon and dan 
and abelmaim and all the store cities of naphtali 
and it came to pass when baasha heard it that he left off 
building of ramah and let his work cease 
then asa the king took all judah and they carried away the 
stones of ramah and the timber thereof wherewith baasha was 
building and he built therewith geba and mizpah 
and at that time hanani the seer came to asa king of judah and 
said unto him because thou hast relied on the king of syria and not 
relied on the lord thy god therefore is the host of the king of syria 
escaped out of thine hand 
were not the ethiopians and the lubims a huge host with very 
many chariots and horsemen yet because thou didst rely on the lord 
he delivered them into thine hand 
for the eyes of the lord run to and fro throughout the whole 
earth to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is 
perfect toward him herein thou hast done foolishly therefore from 
henceforth thou shalt have wars 
then asa was wroth with the seer and put him in a prison house 
for he was in a rage with him because of this thing and asa oppressed 
some of the people the same time 
and behold the acts of asa first and last lo they are 
written in the book of the kings of judah and israel 
and asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased 
in his feet until his disease was exceeding great yet in his disease 
he sought not to the lord but to the physicians 
and asa slept with his fathers and died in the one and fortieth 
year of his reign 
and they buried him in his own sepulchres which he had made for 
himself in the city of david and laid him in the bed which was filled 
with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by the 
apothecaries art and they made a very great burning for him 
and jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead and strengthened 
himself against israel 
and he placed forces in all the fenced cities of judah and set 
garrisons in the land of judah and in the cities of ephraim which 
asa his father had taken 
and the lord was with jehoshaphat because he walked in the first 
ways of his father david and sought not unto baalim but sought 
to the lord god of his father and walked in his commandments and not 
after the doings of israel 
therefore the lord stablished the kingdom in his hand and all 
judah brought to jehoshaphat presents and he had riches and honour in 
abundance 
and his heart was lifted up in the ways of the lord moreover he 
took away the high places and groves out of judah 
also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes even 
to benhail and to obadiah and to zechariah and to nethaneel and to 
michaiah to teach in the cities of judah 
and with them he sent levites even shemaiah and nethaniah and 
zebadiah and asahel and shemiramoth and jehonathan and adonijah 
and tobijah and tobadonijah levites and with them elishama and 
jehoram priests 
and they taught in judah and had the book of the law of the lord 
with them and went about throughout all the cities of judah and 
taught the people 
and the fear of the lord fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands 
that were round about judah so that they made no war against 
jehoshaphat 
also some of the philistines brought jehoshaphat presents and 
tribute silver and the arabians brought him flocks seven thousand 
and seven hundred rams and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats 
and jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly and he built in judah 
castles and cities of store 
and he had much business in the cities of judah and the men of 
war mighty men of valour were in jerusalem 
and these are the numbers of them according to the house of 
their fathers of judah the captains of thousands adnah the chief 
and with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand 
and next to him was jehohanan the captain and with him two 
hundred and fourscore thousand 
and next him was amasiah the son of zichri who willingly 
offered himself unto the lord and with him two hundred thousand 
mighty men of valour 
and of benjamin eliada a mighty man of valour and with him 
armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand 
and next him was jehozabad and with him an hundred and 
fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war 
these waited on the king beside those whom the king put in the 
fenced cities throughout all judah 
now jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance and joined 
affinity with ahab 
and after certain years he went down to ahab to samaria and ahab 
killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance and for the people that he 
had with him and persuaded him to go up with him to ramothgilead 
and ahab king of israel said unto jehoshaphat king of judah wilt 
thou go with me to ramothgilead and he answered him i am as thou 
art and my people as thy people and we will be with thee in the war 
and jehoshaphat said unto the king of israel enquire i pray 
thee at the word of the lord to day 
therefore the king of israel gathered together of prophets four 
hundred men and said unto them shall we go to ramothgilead to 
battle or shall i forbear and they said go up for god will deliver 
it into the king s hand 
but jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the lord 
besides that we might enquire of him and the king of israel 
said unto jehoshaphat there is yet one man by whom we may enquire of 
the lord but i hate him for he never prophesied good unto me but 
always evil the same is micaiah the son of imla and jehoshaphat 
said let not the king say so 
and the king of israel called for one of his officers and said 
fetch quickly micaiah the son of imla 
and the king of israel and jehoshaphat king of judah sat either 
of them on his throne clothed in their robes and they sat in a void 
place at the entering in of the gate of samaria and all the prophets 
prophesied before them 
and zedekiah the son of chenaanah had made him horns of iron 
and said thus saith the lord with these thou shalt push syria until 
they be consumed 
and all the prophets prophesied so saying go up to 
ramothgilead and prosper for the lord shall deliver it into the hand 
of the king 
and the messenger that went to call micaiah spake to him 
saying behold the words of the prophets declare good to the king 
with one assent let thy word therefore i pray thee be like one of 
their s and speak thou good 
and micaiah said as the lord liveth even what my god saith 
that will i speak 
and when he was come to the king the king said unto him 
micaiah shall we go to ramothgilead to battle or shall i forbear 
and he said go ye up and prosper and they shall be delivered into 
your hand 
and the king said to him how many times shall i adjure thee 
that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the lord 
then he said i did see all israel scattered upon the mountains 
as sheep that have no shepherd and the lord said these have no 
master let them return therefore every man to his house in peace 
and the king of israel said to jehoshaphat did i not tell thee 
that he would not prophesy good unto me but evil again he 
said therefore hear the word of the lord i saw the lord sitting upon 
his throne and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and 
on his left 
and the lord said who shall entice ahab king of israel that he 
may go up and fall at ramothgilead and one spake saying after this 
manner and another saying after that manner 
then there came out a spirit and stood before the lord and 
said i will entice him and the lord said unto him wherewith 
and he said i will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all 
his prophets and the lord said thou shalt entice him and thou shalt 
also prevail go out and do even so 
now therefore behold the lord hath put a lying spirit in the 
mouth of these thy prophets and the lord hath spoken evil against 
thee 
then zedekiah the son of chenaanah came near and smote micaiah 
upon the cheek and said which way went the spirit of the lord from 
me to speak unto thee and micaiah said behold thou shalt see 
on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself 
then the king of israel said take ye micaiah and carry him 
back to amon the governor of the city and to joash the king s son 
and say thus saith the king put this fellow in the prison and 
feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction until 
i return in peace 
and micaiah said if thou certainly return in peace then hath 
not the lord spoken by me and he said hearken all ye people 
so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah went up 
to ramothgilead 
and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat i will disguise 
myself and i will go to the battle but put thou on thy robes so the 
king of israel disguised himself and they went to the battle 
now the king of syria had commanded the captains of the chariots 
that were with him saying fight ye not with small or great save 
only with the king of israel 
and it came to pass when the captains of the chariots saw 
jehoshaphat that they said it is the king of israel therefore they 
compassed about him to fight but jehoshaphat cried out and the lord 
helped him and god moved them to depart from him 
for it came to pass that when the captains of the chariots 
perceived that it was not the king of israel they turned back again 
from pursuing him 
and a certain man drew a bow at a venture and smote the king of 
israel between the joints of the harness therefore he said to his 
chariot man turn thine hand that thou mayest carry me out of the 
host for i am wounded 
and the battle increased that day howbeit the king of israel 
stayed himself up in his chariot against the syrians until the even 
and about the time of the sun going down he died 
and jehoshaphat the king of judah returned to his house in peace 
to jerusalem 
and jehu the son of hanani the seer went out to meet him and 
said to king jehoshaphat shouldest thou help the ungodly and love 
them that hate the lord therefore is wrath upon thee from before the 
lord 
nevertheless there are good things found in thee in that thou 
hast taken away the groves out of the land and hast prepared thine 
heart to seek god 
and jehoshaphat dwelt at jerusalem and he went out again through 
the people from beersheba to mount ephraim and brought them back unto 
the lord god of their fathers 
and he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of 
judah city by city and said to the judges take heed what ye 
do for ye judge not for man but for the lord who is with you in the 
judgment 
wherefore now let the fear of the lord be upon you take heed and 
do it for there is no iniquity with the lord our god nor respect of 
persons nor taking of gifts 
moreover in jerusalem did jehoshaphat set of the levites and of 
the priests and of the chief of the fathers of israel for the 
judgment of the lord and for controversies when they returned to 
jerusalem 
and he charged them saying thus shall ye do in the fear of the 
lord faithfully and with a perfect heart 
and what because soever shall come to you of your brethren that 
dwell in your cities between blood and blood between law and 
commandment statutes and judgments ye shall even warn them that they 
trespass not against the lord and so wrath come upon you and upon 
your brethren this do and ye shall not trespass 
and behold amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters 
of the lord and zebadiah the son of ishmael the ruler of the house 
of judah for all the king s matters also the levites shall be 
officers before you deal courageously and the lord shall be with the 
good 
it came to pass after this also that the children of moab and 
the children of ammon and with them other beside the ammonites came 
against jehoshaphat to battle 
then there came some that told jehoshaphat saying there cometh 
a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side syria 
and behold they be in hazazontamar which is engedi 
and jehoshaphat feared and set himself to seek the lord and 
proclaimed a fast throughout all judah 
and judah gathered themselves together to ask help of the lord 
even out of all the cities of judah they came to seek the lord 
and jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of judah and jerusalem 
in the house of the lord before the new court and said o lord 
god of our fathers art not thou god in heaven and rulest not thou 
over all the kingdoms of the heathen and in thine hand is there not 
power and might so that none is able to withstand thee art not 
thou our god who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before 
thy people israel and gavest it to the seed of abraham thy friend for 
ever and they dwelt therein and have built thee a sanctuary 
therein for thy name saying if when evil cometh upon us as 
the sword judgment or pestilence or famine we stand before this 
house and in thy presence for thy name is in this house and cry 
unto thee in our affliction then thou wilt hear and help 
and now behold the children of ammon and moab and mount seir 
whom thou wouldest not let israel invade when they came out of the 
land of egypt but they turned from them and destroyed them not 
behold i say how they reward us to come to cast us out of thy 
possession which thou hast given us to inherit 
o our god wilt thou not judge them for we have no might 
against this great company that cometh against us neither know we 
what to do but our eyes are upon thee 
and all judah stood before the lord with their little ones 
their wives and their children 
then upon jahaziel the son of zechariah the son of benaiah the 
son of jeiel the son of mattaniah a levite of the sons of asaph 
came the spirit of the lord in the midst of the congregation 
and he said hearken ye all judah and ye inhabitants of jerusalem 
and thou king jehoshaphat thus saith the lord unto you be not afraid 
nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude for the battle is not 
yours but god s 
to morrow go ye down against them behold they come up by the 
cliff of ziz and ye shall find them at the end of the brook before 
the wilderness of jeruel 
ye shall not need to fight in this battle set yourselves stand 
ye still and see the salvation of the lord with you o judah and 
jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed to morrow go out against them 
for the lord will be with you 
and jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground and 
all judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem fell before the lord 
worshipping the lord 
and the levites of the children of the kohathites and of the 
children of the korhites stood up to praise the lord god of israel 
with a loud voice on high 
and they rose early in the morning and went forth into the 
wilderness of tekoa and as they went forth jehoshaphat stood and 
said hear me o judah and ye inhabitants of jerusalem believe in 
the lord your god so shall ye be established believe his prophets 
so shall ye prosper 
and when he had consulted with the people he appointed singers 
unto the lord and that should praise the beauty of holiness as they 
went out before the army and to say praise the lord for his mercy 
endureth for ever 
and when they began to sing and to praise the lord set 
ambushments against the children of ammon moab and mount seir which 
were come against judah and they were smitten 
for the children of ammon and moab stood up against the 
inhabitants of mount seir utterly to slay and destroy them and when 
they had made an end of the inhabitants of seir every one helped to 
destroy another 
and when judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness 
they looked unto the multitude and behold they were dead bodies 
fallen to the earth and none escaped 
and when jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil 
of them they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead 
bodies and precious jewels which they stripped off for themselves 
more than they could carry away and they were three days in gathering 
of the spoil it was so much 
and on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of 
berachah for there they blessed the lord therefore the name of the 
same place was called the valley of berachah unto this day 
then they returned every man of judah and jerusalem and 
jehoshaphat in the forefront of them to go again to jerusalem with 
joy for the lord had made them to rejoice over their enemies 
and they came to jerusalem with psalteries and harps and 
trumpets unto the house of the lord 
and the fear of god was on all the kingdoms of those countries 
when they had heard that the lord fought against the enemies of 
israel 
so the realm of jehoshaphat was quiet for his god gave him rest 
round about 
and jehoshaphat reigned over judah he was thirty and five years 
old when he began to reign and he reigned twenty and five years in 
jerusalem 
and his mother s name was azubah the daughter of shilhi 
and he walked in the way of asa his father and departed not 
from it doing that which was right in the sight of the lord 
howbeit the high places were not taken away for as yet the 
people had not prepared their hearts unto the god of their fathers 
now the rest of the acts of jehoshaphat first and last behold 
they are written in the book of jehu the son of hanani who is 
mentioned in the book of the kings of israel 
and after this did jehoshaphat king of judah join himself with 
ahaziah king of israel who did very wickedly and he joined 
himself with him to make ships to go to tarshish and they made the 
ships in eziongaber 
then eliezer the son of dodavah of mareshah prophesied against 
jehoshaphat saying because thou hast joined thyself with ahaziah 
the lord hath broken thy works and the ships were broken that they 
were not able to go to tarshish 
now jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his 
fathers in the city of david and jehoram his son reigned in his 
stead 
and he had brethren the sons of jehoshaphat azariah and jehiel 
and zechariah and azariah and michael and shephatiah all these 
were the sons of jehoshaphat king of israel 
and their father gave them great gifts of silver and of gold 
and of precious things with fenced cities in judah but the kingdom 
gave he to jehoram because he was the firstborn 
now when jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father he 
strengthened himself and slew all his brethren with the sword and 
divers also of the princes of israel 
jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign and 
he reigned eight years in jerusalem 
and he walked in the way of the kings of israel like as did the 
house of ahab for he had the daughter of ahab to wife and he wrought 
that which was evil in the eyes of the lord 
howbeit the lord would not destroy the house of david because of 
the covenant that he had made with david and as he promised to give a 
light to him and to his sons for ever 
in his days the edomites revolted from under the dominion of 
judah and made themselves a king 
then jehoram went forth with his princes and all his chariots 
with him and he rose up by night and smote the edomites which 
compassed him in and the captains of the chariots 
so the edomites revolted from under the hand of judah unto this 
day 
the same time also did libnah revolt from under his hand because he 
had forsaken the lord god of his fathers 
moreover he made high places in the mountains of judah and 
caused the inhabitants of jerusalem to commit fornication and 
compelled judah thereto 
and there came a writing to him from elijah the prophet saying 
thus saith the lord god of david thy father because thou hast not 
walked in the ways of jehoshaphat thy father nor in the ways of asa 
king of judah but hast walked in the way of the kings of 
israel and hast made judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem to go a 
whoring like to the whoredoms of the house of ahab and also hast 
slain thy brethren of thy father s house which were better than 
thyself behold with a great plague will the lord smite thy 
people and thy children and thy wives and all thy goods and 
thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels until thy 
bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day 
moreover the lord stirred up against jehoram the spirit of the 
philistines and of the arabians that were near the ethiopians 
and they came up into judah and brake into it and carried away all 
the substance that was found in the king s house and his sons also 
and his wives so that there was never a son left him save jehoahaz 
the youngest of his sons 
and after all this the lord smote him in his bowels with an 
incurable disease 
and it came to pass that in process of time after the end of 
two years his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness so he died 
of sore diseases and his people made no burning for him like the 
burning of his fathers 
thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign and he 
reigned in jerusalem eight years and departed without being desired 
howbeit they buried him in the city of david but not in the 
sepulchres of the kings 
and the inhabitants of jerusalem made ahaziah his youngest son 
king in his stead for the band of men that came with the arabians to 
the camp had slain all the eldest so ahaziah the son of jehoram king 
of judah reigned 
forty and two years old was ahaziah when he began to reign and 
he reigned one year in jerusalem his mother s name also was athaliah 
the daughter of omri 
he also walked in the ways of the house of ahab for his mother 
was his counsellor to do wickedly 
wherefore he did evil in the sight of the lord like the house of 
ahab for they were his counsellors after the death of his father to 
his destruction 
he walked also after their counsel and went with jehoram the son 
of ahab king of israel to war against hazael king of syria at 
ramothgilead and the syrians smote joram 
and he returned to be healed in jezreel because of the wounds 
which were given him at ramah when he fought with hazael king of 
syria and azariah the son of jehoram king of judah went down to see 
jehoram the son of ahab at jezreel because he was sick 
and the destruction of ahaziah was of god by coming to joram for 
when he was come he went out with jehoram against jehu the son of 
nimshi whom the lord had anointed to cut off the house of ahab 
and it came to pass that when jehu was executing judgment upon 
the house of ahab and found the princes of judah and the sons of the 
brethren of ahaziah that ministered to ahaziah he slew them 
and he sought ahaziah and they caught him for he was hid in 
samaria and brought him to jehu and when they had slain him they 
buried him because said they he is the son of jehoshaphat who 
sought the lord with all his heart so the house of ahaziah had no 
power to keep still the kingdom 
but when athaliah the mother of ahaziah saw that her son was 
dead she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of 
judah 
but jehoshabeath the daughter of the king took joash the son 
of ahaziah and stole him from among the king s sons that were slain 
and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber so jehoshabeath the 
daughter of king jehoram the wife of jehoiada the priest for she 
was the sister of ahaziah hid him from athaliah so that she slew 
him not 
and he was with them hid in the house of god six years and 
athaliah reigned over the land 
and in the seventh year jehoiada strengthened himself and took 
the captains of hundreds azariah the son of jeroham and ishmael the 
son of jehohanan and azariah the son of obed and maaseiah the son of 
adaiah and elishaphat the son of zichri into covenant with him 
and they went about in judah and gathered the levites out of all 
the cities of judah and the chief of the fathers of israel and they 
came to jerusalem 
and all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the 
house of god and he said unto them behold the king s son shall 
reign as the lord hath said of the sons of david 
this is the thing that ye shall do a third part of you entering 
on the sabbath of the priests and of the levites shall be porters of 
the doors and a third part shall be at the king s house and a 
third part at the gate of the foundation and all the people shall be 
in the courts of the house of the lord 
but let none come into the house of the lord save the priests 
and they that minister of the levites they shall go in for they are 
holy but all the people shall keep the watch of the lord 
and the levites shall compass the king round about every man 
with his weapons in his hand and whosoever else cometh into the 
house he shall be put to death but be ye with the king when he 
cometh in and when he goeth out 
so the levites and all judah did according to all things that 
jehoiada the priest had commanded and took every man his men that 
were to come in on the sabbath with them that were to go out on the 
sabbath for jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses 
moreover jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of 
hundreds spears and bucklers and shields that had been king 
david s which were in the house of god 
and he set all the people every man having his weapon in his 
hand from the right side of the temple to the left side of the 
temple along by the altar and the temple by the king round about 
then they brought out the king s son and put upon him the 
crown and gave him the testimony and made him king and jehoiada and 
his sons anointed him and said god save the king 
now when athaliah heard the noise of the people running and 
praising the king she came to the people into the house of the lord 
and she looked and behold the king stood at his pillar at the 
entering in and the princes and the trumpets by the king and all the 
people of the land rejoiced and sounded with trumpets also the 
singers with instruments of musick and such as taught to sing praise 
then athaliah rent her clothes and said treason treason 
then jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds 
that were set over the host and said unto them have her forth of the 
ranges and whoso followeth her let him be slain with the sword for 
the priest said slay her not in the house of the lord 
so they laid hands on her and when she was come to the entering 
of the horse gate by the king s house they slew her there 
and jehoiada made a covenant between him and between all the 
people and between the king that they should be the lord s people 
then all the people went to the house of baal and brake it 
down and brake his altars and his images in pieces and slew mattan 
the priest of baal before the altars 
also jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the lord by 
the hand of the priests the levites whom david had distributed in the 
house of the lord to offer the burnt offerings of the lord as it is 
written in the law of moses with rejoicing and with singing as it 
was ordained by david 
and he set the porters at the gates of the house of the lord 
that none which was unclean in any thing should enter in 
and he took the captains of hundreds and the nobles and the 
governors of the people and all the people of the land and brought 
down the king from the house of the lord and they came through the 
high gate into the king s house and set the king upon the throne of 
the kingdom 
and all the people of the land rejoiced and the city was quiet 
after that they had slain athaliah with the sword 
joash was seven years old when he began to reign and he reigned 
forty years in jerusalem his mother s name also was zibiah of 
beersheba 
and joash did that which was right in the sight of the lord all 
the days of jehoiada the priest 
and jehoiada took for him two wives and he begat sons and 
daughters 
and it came to pass after this that joash was minded to repair 
the house of the lord 
and he gathered together the priests and the levites and said to 
them go out unto the cities of judah and gather of all israel money 
to repair the house of your god from year to year and see that ye 
hasten the matter howbeit the levites hastened it not 
and the king called for jehoiada the chief and said unto him 
why hast thou not required of the levites to bring in out of judah and 
out of jerusalem the collection according to the commandment of moses 
the servant of the lord and of the congregation of israel for the 
tabernacle of witness for the sons of athaliah that wicked 
woman had broken up the house of god and also all the dedicated 
things of the house of the lord did they bestow upon baalim 
and at the king s commandment they made a chest and set it 
without at the gate of the house of the lord 
and they made a proclamation through judah and jerusalem to 
bring in to the lord the collection that moses the servant of god laid 
upon israel in the wilderness 
and all the princes and all the people rejoiced and brought in 
and cast into the chest until they had made an end 
now it came to pass that at what time the chest was brought 
unto the king s office by the hand of the levites and when they saw 
that there was much money the king s scribe and the high priest s 
officer came and emptied the chest and took it and carried it to his 
place again thus they did day by day and gathered money in 
abundance 
and the king and jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the 
service of the house of the lord and hired masons and carpenters to 
repair the house of the lord and also such as wrought iron and brass 
to mend the house of the lord 
so the workmen wrought and the work was perfected by them and 
they set the house of god in his state and strengthened it 
and when they had finished it they brought the rest of the 
money before the king and jehoiada whereof were made vessels for the 
house of the lord even vessels to minister and to offer withal and 
spoons and vessels of gold and silver and they offered burnt 
offerings in the house of the lord continually all the days of 
jehoiada 
but jehoiada waxed old and was full of days when he died an 
hundred and thirty years old was he when he died 
and they buried him in the city of david among the kings 
because he had done good in israel both toward god and toward his 
house 
now after the death of jehoiada came the princes of judah and 
made obeisance to the king then the king hearkened unto them 
and they left the house of the lord god of their fathers and 
served groves and idols and wrath came upon judah and jerusalem for 
this their trespass 
yet he sent prophets to them to bring them again unto the lord 
and they testified against them but they would not give ear 
and the spirit of god came upon zechariah the son of jehoiada 
the priest which stood above the people and said unto them thus 
saith god why transgress ye the commandments of the lord that ye 
cannot prosper because ye have forsaken the lord he hath also 
forsaken you 
and they conspired against him and stoned him with stones at 
the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the lord 
thus joash the king remembered not the kindness which jehoiada 
his father had done to him but slew his son and when he died he 
said the lord look upon it and require it 
and it came to pass at the end of the year that the host of 
syria came up against him and they came to judah and jerusalem and 
destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people and 
sent all the spoil of them unto the king of damascus 
for the army of the syrians came with a small company of men 
and the lord delivered a very great host into their hand because they 
had forsaken the lord god of their fathers so they executed judgment 
against joash 
and when they were departed from him for they left him in 
great diseases his own servants conspired against him for the blood 
of the sons of jehoiada the priest and slew him on his bed and he 
died and they buried him in the city of david but they buried him 
not in the sepulchres of the kings 
and these are they that conspired against him zabad the son of 
shimeath an ammonitess and jehozabad the son of shimrith a moabitess 
now concerning his sons and the greatness of the burdens laid 
upon him and the repairing of the house of god behold they are 
written in the story of the book of the kings and amaziah his son 
reigned in his stead 
amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign and 
he reigned twenty and nine years in jerusalem and his mother s name 
was jehoaddan of jerusalem 
and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord but not 
with a perfect heart 
now it came to pass when the kingdom was established to him 
that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father 
but he slew not their children but did as it is written in the 
law in the book of moses where the lord commanded saying the 
fathers shall not die for the children neither shall the children die 
for the fathers but every man shall die for his own sin 
moreover amaziah gathered judah together and made them captains 
over thousands and captains over hundreds according to the houses of 
their fathers throughout all judah and benjamin and he numbered them 
from twenty years old and above and found them three hundred thousand 
choice men able to go forth to war that could handle spear and 
shield 
he hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of 
israel for an hundred talents of silver 
but there came a man of god to him saying o king let not the 
army of israel go with thee for the lord is not with israel to wit 
with all the children of ephraim 
but if thou wilt go do it be strong for the battle god shall 
make thee fall before the enemy for god hath power to help and to 
cast down 
and amaziah said to the man of god but what shall we do for the 
hundred talents which i have given to the army of israel and the man 
of god answered the lord is able to give thee much more than this 
then amaziah separated them to wit the army that was come to 
him out of ephraim to go home again wherefore their anger was 
greatly kindled against judah and they returned home in great anger 
and amaziah strengthened himself and led forth his people and 
went to the valley of salt and smote of the children of seir ten 
thousand 
and other ten thousand left alive did the children of judah 
carry away captive and brought them unto the top of the rock and 
cast them down from the top of the rock that they all were broken in 
pieces 
but the soldiers of the army which amaziah sent back that they 
should not go with him to battle fell upon the cities of judah from 
samaria even unto bethhoron and smote three thousand of them and 
took much spoil 
now it came to pass after that amaziah was come from the 
slaughter of the edomites that he brought the gods of the children of 
seir and set them up to be his gods and bowed down himself before 
them and burned incense unto them 
wherefore the anger of the lord was kindled against amaziah and 
he sent unto him a prophet which said unto him why hast thou sought 
after the gods of the people which could not deliver their own people 
out of thine hand and it came to pass as he talked with him 
that the king said unto him art thou made of the king s counsel 
forbear why shouldest thou be smitten then the prophet forbare and 
said i know that god hath determined to destroy thee because thou 
hast done this and hast not hearkened unto my counsel 
then amaziah king of judah took advice and sent to joash the 
son of jehoahaz the son of jehu king of israel saying come let us 
see one another in the face 
and joash king of israel sent to amaziah king of judah saying 
the thistle that was in lebanon sent to the cedar that was in lebanon 
saying give thy daughter to my son to wife and there passed by a 
wild beast that was in lebanon and trode down the thistle 
thou sayest lo thou hast smitten the edomites and thine heart 
lifteth thee up to boast abide now at home why shouldest thou meddle 
to thine hurt that thou shouldest fall even thou and judah with 
thee but amaziah would not hear for it came of god that he 
might deliver them into the hand of their enemies because they sought 
after the gods of edom 
so joash the king of israel went up and they saw one another in 
the face both he and amaziah king of judah at bethshemesh which 
belongeth to judah 
and judah was put to the worse before israel and they fled 
every man to his tent 
and joash the king of israel took amaziah king of judah the son 
of joash the son of jehoahaz at bethshemesh and brought him to 
jerusalem and brake down the wall of jerusalem from the gate of 
ephraim to the corner gate four hundred cubits 
and he took all the gold and the silver and all the vessels 
that were found in the house of god with obededom and the treasures 
of the king s house the hostages also and returned to samaria 
and amaziah the son of joash king of judah lived after the death 
of joash son of jehoahaz king of israel fifteen years 
now the rest of the acts of amaziah first and last behold are 
they not written in the book of the kings of judah and israel 
now after the time that amaziah did turn away from following the lord 
they made a conspiracy against him in jerusalem and he fled to 
lachish but they sent to lachish after him and slew him there 
and they brought him upon horses and buried him with his 
fathers in the city of judah 
then all the people of judah took uzziah who was sixteen years 
old and made him king in the room of his father amaziah 
he built eloth and restored it to judah after that the king 
slept with his fathers 
sixteen years old was uzziah when he began to reign and he 
reigned fifty and two years in jerusalem his mother s name also was 
jecoliah of jerusalem 
and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord 
according to all that his father amaziah did 
and he sought god in the days of zechariah who had understanding 
in the visions of god and as long as he sought the lord god made him 
to prosper 
and he went forth and warred against the philistines and brake 
down the wall of gath and the wall of jabneh and the wall of ashdod 
and built cities about ashdod and among the philistines 
and god helped him against the philistines and against the 
arabians that dwelt in gurbaal and the mehunims 
and the ammonites gave gifts to uzziah and his name spread 
abroad even to the entering in of egypt for he strengthened himself 
exceedingly 
moreover uzziah built towers in jerusalem at the corner gate and 
at the valley gate and at the turning of the wall and fortified 
them 
also he built towers in the desert and digged many wells for 
he had much cattle both in the low country and in the plains 
husbandmen also and vine dressers in the mountains and in carmel 
for he loved husbandry 
moreover uzziah had an host of fighting men that went out to 
war by bands according to the number of their account by the hand of 
jeiel the scribe and maaseiah the ruler under the hand of hananiah 
one of the king s captains 
the whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men 
of valour were two thousand and six hundred 
and under their hand was an army three hundred thousand and 
seven thousand and five hundred that made war with mighty power to 
help the king against the enemy 
and uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields 
and spears and helmets and habergeons and bows and slings to cast 
stones 
and he made in jerusalem engines invented by cunning men to be 
on the towers and upon the bulwarks to shoot arrows and great stones 
withal 
and his name spread far abroad for he was marvellously helped till 
he was strong 
but when he was strong his heart was lifted up to his 
destruction for he transgressed against the lord his god and went 
into the temple of the lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense 
and azariah the priest went in after him and with him fourscore 
priests of the lord that were valiant men and they withstood 
uzziah the king and said unto him it appertaineth not unto thee 
uzziah to burn incense unto the lord but to the priests the sons of 
aaron that are consecrated to burn incense go out of the sanctuary 
for thou hast trespassed neither shall it be for thine honour from 
the lord god 
then uzziah was wroth and had a censer in his hand to burn 
incense and while he was wroth with the priests the leprosy even 
rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the lord 
from beside the incense altar 
and azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked upon 
him and behold he was leprous in his forehead and they thrust him 
out from thence yea himself hasted also to go out because the lord 
had smitten him 
and uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death and 
dwelt in a several house being a leper for he was cut off from the 
house of the lord and jotham his son was over the king s house 
judging the people of the land 
now the rest of the acts of uzziah first and last did isaiah 
the prophet the son of amoz write 
so uzziah slept with his fathers and they buried him with his 
fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings for 
they said he is a leper and jotham his son reigned in his stead 
jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign and 
he reigned sixteen years in jerusalem his mother s name also was 
jerushah the daughter of zadok 
and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord 
according to all that his father uzziah did howbeit he entered not 
into the temple of the lord and the people did yet corruptly 
he built the high gate of the house of the lord and on the wall 
of ophel he built much 
moreover he built cities in the mountains of judah and in the 
forests he built castles and towers 
he fought also with the king of the ammonites and prevailed 
against them and the children of ammon gave him the same year an 
hundred talents of silver and ten thousand measures of wheat and ten 
thousand of barley so much did the children of ammon pay unto him 
both the second year and the third 
so jotham became mighty because he prepared his ways before the 
lord his god 
now the rest of the acts of jotham and all his wars and his 
ways lo they are written in the book of the kings of israel and 
judah 
he was five and twenty years old when he began to reign and 
reigned sixteen years in jerusalem 
and jotham slept with his fathers and they buried him in the 
city of david and ahaz his son reigned in his stead 
ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign and he reigned 
sixteen years in jerusalem but he did not that which was right in the 
sight of the lord like david his father for he walked in the 
ways of the kings of israel and made also molten images for baalim 
moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of hinnom and 
burnt his children in the fire after the abominations of the heathen 
whom the lord had cast out before the children of israel 
he sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places and on 
the hills and under every green tree 
wherefore the lord his god delivered him into the hand of the 
king of syria and they smote him and carried away a great multitude 
of them captives and brought them to damascus and he was also 
delivered into the hand of the king of israel who smote him with a 
great slaughter 
for pekah the son of remaliah slew in judah an hundred and twenty 
thousand in one day which were all valiant men because they had 
forsaken the lord god of their fathers 
and zichri a mighty man of ephraim slew maaseiah the king s 
son and azrikam the governor of the house and elkanah that was next 
to the king 
and the children of israel carried away captive of their brethren 
two hundred thousand women sons and daughters and took also away 
much spoil from them and brought the spoil to samaria 
but a prophet of the lord was there whose name was oded and he 
went out before the host that came to samaria and said unto them 
behold because the lord god of your fathers was wroth with judah he 
hath delivered them into your hand and ye have slain them in a rage 
that reacheth up unto heaven 
and now ye purpose to keep under the children of judah and 
jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you but are there not with 
you even with you sins against the lord your god now hear me 
therefore and deliver the captives again which ye have taken captive 
of your brethren for the fierce wrath of the lord is upon you 
then certain of the heads of the children of ephraim azariah 
the son of johanan berechiah the son of meshillemoth and jehizkiah 
the son of shallum and amasa the son of hadlai stood up against them 
that came from the war and said unto them ye shall not bring 
in the captives hither for whereas we have offended against the lord 
already ye intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass for 
our trespass is great and there is fierce wrath against israel 
so the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the 
princes and all the congregation 
and the men which were expressed by name rose up and took the 
captives and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them 
and arrayed them and shod them and gave them to eat and to drink 
and anointed them and carried all the feeble of them upon asses and 
brought them to jericho the city of palm trees to their brethren 
then they returned to samaria 
at that time did king ahaz send unto the kings of assyria to 
help him 
for again the edomites had come and smitten judah and carried 
away captives 
the philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country 
and of the south of judah and had taken bethshemesh and ajalon and 
gederoth and shocho with the villages thereof and timnah with the 
villages thereof gimzo also and the villages thereof and they dwelt 
there 
for the lord brought judah low because of ahaz king of israel 
for he made judah naked and transgressed sore against the lord 
and tilgathpilneser king of assyria came unto him and 
distressed him but strengthened him not 
for ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the lord and 
out of the house of the king and of the princes and gave it unto the 
king of assyria but he helped him not 
and in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against 
the lord this is that king ahaz 
for he sacrificed unto the gods of damascus which smote him 
and he said because the gods of the kings of syria help them 
therefore will i sacrifice to them that they may help me but they 
were the ruin of him and of all israel 
and ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of god and 
cut in pieces the vessels of the house of god and shut up the doors 
of the house of the lord and he made him altars in every corner of 
jerusalem 
and in every several city of judah he made high places to burn 
incense unto other gods and provoked to anger the lord god of his 
fathers 
now the rest of his acts and of all his ways first and last 
behold they are written in the book of the kings of judah and israel 
and ahaz slept with his fathers and they buried him in the 
city even in jerusalem but they brought him not into the sepulchres 
of the kings of israel and hezekiah his son reigned in his stead 
hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old 
and he reigned nine and twenty years in jerusalem and his mother s 
name was abijah the daughter of zechariah 
and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord 
according to all that david his father had done 
he in the first year of his reign in the first month opened the 
doors of the house of the lord and repaired them 
and he brought in the priests and the levites and gathered them 
together into the east street and said unto them hear me ye 
levites sanctify now yourselves and sanctify the house of the lord 
god of your fathers and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy 
place 
for our fathers have trespassed and done that which was evil in 
the eyes of the lord our god and have forsaken him and have turned 
away their faces from the habitation of the lord and turned their 
backs 
also they have shut up the doors of the porch and put out the 
lamps and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the 
holy place unto the god of israel 
wherefore the wrath of the lord was upon judah and jerusalem and 
he hath delivered them to trouble to astonishment and to hissing as 
ye see with your eyes 
for lo our fathers have fallen by the sword and our sons and 
our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this 
now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the lord god of 
israel that his fierce wrath may turn away from us 
my sons be not now negligent for the lord hath chosen you to 
stand before him to serve him and that ye should minister unto him 
and burn incense 
then the levites arose mahath the son of amasai and joel the 
son of azariah of the sons of the kohathites and of the sons of 
merari kish the son of abdi and azariah the son of jehalelel and of 
the gershonites joah the son of zimmah and eden the son of joah 
and of the sons of elizaphan shimri and jeiel and of the sons 
of asaph zechariah and mattaniah and of the sons of heman 
jehiel and shimei and of the sons of jeduthun shemaiah and uzziel 
and they gathered their brethren and sanctified themselves and 
came according to the commandment of the king by the words of the 
lord to cleanse the house of the lord 
and the priests went into the inner part of the house of the 
lord to cleanse it and brought out all the uncleanness that they 
found in the temple of the lord into the court of the house of the 
lord and the levites took it to carry it out abroad into the brook 
kidron 
now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify 
and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the lord 
so they sanctified the house of the lord in eight days and in the 
sixteenth day of the first month they made an end 
then they went in to hezekiah the king and said we have 
cleansed all the house of the lord and the altar of burnt offering 
with all the vessels thereof and the shewbread table with all the 
vessels thereof 
moreover all the vessels which king ahaz in his reign did cast 
away in his transgression have we prepared and sanctified and 
behold they are before the altar of the lord 
then hezekiah the king rose early and gathered the rulers of 
the city and went up to the house of the lord 
and they brought seven bullocks and seven rams and seven 
lambs and seven he goats for a sin offering for the kingdom and for 
the sanctuary and for judah and he commanded the priests the sons of 
aaron to offer them on the altar of the lord 
so they killed the bullocks and the priests received the blood 
and sprinkled it on the altar likewise when they had killed the 
rams they sprinkled the blood upon the altar they killed also the 
lambs and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar 
and they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering before 
the king and the congregation and they laid their hands upon them 
and the priests killed them and they made reconciliation with 
their blood upon the altar to make an atonement for all israel for 
the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should 
be made for all israel 
and he set the levites in the house of the lord with cymbals 
with psalteries and with harps according to the commandment of 
david and of gad the king s seer and nathan the prophet for so was 
the commandment of the lord by his prophets 
and the levites stood with the instruments of david and the 
priests with the trumpets 
and hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the 
altar 
and when the burnt offering began the song of the lord began also 
with the trumpets and with the instruments ordained by david king of 
israel 
and all the congregation worshipped and the singers sang and 
the trumpeters sounded and all this continued until the burnt 
offering was finished 
and when they had made an end of offering the king and all that 
were present with him bowed themselves and worshipped 
moreover hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the levites 
to sing praise unto the lord with the words of david and of asaph the 
seer and they sang praises with gladness and they bowed their heads 
and worshipped 
then hezekiah answered and said now ye have consecrated 
yourselves unto the lord come near and bring sacrifices and thank 
offerings into the house of the lord and the congregation brought in 
sacrifices and thank offerings and as many as were of a free heart 
burnt offerings 
and the number of the burnt offerings which the congregation 
brought was threescore and ten bullocks an hundred rams and two 
hundred lambs all these were for a burnt offering to the lord 
and the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three 
thousand sheep 
but the priests were too few so that they could not flay all 
the burnt offerings wherefore their brethren the levites did help 
them till the work was ended and until the other priests had 
sanctified themselves for the levites were more upright in heart to 
sanctify themselves than the priests 
and also the burnt offerings were in abundance with the fat of 
the peace offerings and the drink offerings for every burnt offering 
so the service of the house of the lord was set in order 
and hezekiah rejoiced and all the people that god had prepared 
the people for the thing was done suddenly 
and hezekiah sent to all israel and judah and wrote letters also 
to ephraim and manasseh that they should come to the house of the 
lord at jerusalem to keep the passover unto the lord god of israel 
for the king had taken counsel and his princes and all the 
congregation in jerusalem to keep the passover in the second month 
for they could not keep it at that time because the priests had 
not sanctified themselves sufficiently neither had the people 
gathered themselves together to jerusalem 
and the thing pleased the king and all the congregation 
so they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all 
israel from beersheba even to dan that they should come to keep the 
passover unto the lord god of israel at jerusalem for they had not 
done it of a long time in such sort as it was written 
so the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes 
throughout all israel and judah and according to the commandment of 
the king saying ye children of israel turn again unto the lord god 
of abraham isaac and israel and he will return to the remnant of 
you that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of assyria 
and be not ye like your fathers and like your brethren which 
trespassed against the lord god of their fathers who therefore gave 
them up to desolation as ye see 
now be ye not stiffnecked as your fathers were but yield 
yourselves unto the lord and enter into his sanctuary which he hath 
sanctified for ever and serve the lord your god that the fierceness 
of his wrath may turn away from you 
for if ye turn again unto the lord your brethren and your 
children shall find compassion before them that lead them captive so 
that they shall come again into this land for the lord your god is 
gracious and merciful and will not turn away his face from you if ye 
return unto him 
so the posts passed from city to city through the country of 
ephraim and manasseh even unto zebulun but they laughed them to 
scorn and mocked them 
nevertheless divers of asher and manasseh and of zebulun humbled 
themselves and came to jerusalem 
also in judah the hand of god was to give them one heart to do 
the commandment of the king and of the princes by the word of the 
lord 
and there assembled at jerusalem much people to keep the feast 
of unleavened bread in the second month a very great congregation 
and they arose and took away the altars that were in jerusalem 
and all the altars for incense took they away and cast them into the 
brook kidron 
then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the 
second month and the priests and the levites were ashamed and 
sanctified themselves and brought in the burnt offerings into the 
house of the lord 
and they stood in their place after their manner according to 
the law of moses the man of god the priests sprinkled the blood 
which they received of the hand of the levites 
for there were many in the congregation that were not 
sanctified therefore the levites had the charge of the killing of the 
passovers for every one that was not clean to sanctify them unto the 
lord 
for a multitude of the people even many of ephraim and 
manasseh issachar and zebulun had not cleansed themselves yet did 
they eat the passover otherwise than it was written but hezekiah 
prayed for them saying the good lord pardon every one that 
prepareth his heart to seek god the lord god of his fathers though 
he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary 
and the lord hearkened to hezekiah and healed the people 
and the children of israel that were present at jerusalem kept 
the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness and the 
levites and the priests praised the lord day by day singing with loud 
instruments unto the lord 
and hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the levites that taught 
the good knowledge of the lord and they did eat throughout the feast 
seven days offering peace offerings and making confession to the 
lord god of their fathers 
and the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days 
and they kept other seven days with gladness 
for hezekiah king of judah did give to the congregation a 
thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep and the princes gave to 
the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep and a 
great number of priests sanctified themselves 
and all the congregation of judah with the priests and the 
levites and all the congregation that came out of israel and the 
strangers that came out of the land of israel and that dwelt in 
judah rejoiced 
so there was great joy in jerusalem for since the time of 
solomon the son of david king of israel there was not the like in 
jerusalem 
then the priests the levites arose and blessed the people and 
their voice was heard and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling 
place even unto heaven 
now when all this was finished all israel that were present went 
out to the cities of judah and brake the images in pieces and cut 
down the groves and threw down the high places and the altars out of 
all judah and benjamin in ephraim also and manasseh until they had 
utterly destroyed them all then all the children of israel returned 
every man to his possession into their own cities 
and hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the levites 
after their courses every man according to his service the priests 
and levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings to minister 
and to give thanks and to praise in the gates of the tents of the 
lord 
he appointed also the king s portion of his substance for the 
burnt offerings to wit for the morning and evening burnt offerings 
and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths and for the new moons and 
for the set feasts as it is written in the law of the lord 
moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in jerusalem to give 
the portion of the priests and the levites that they might be 
encouraged in the law of the lord 
and as soon as the commandment came abroad the children of 
israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn wine and oil 
and honey and of all the increase of the field and the tithe of all 
things brought they in abundantly 
and concerning the children of israel and judah that dwelt in 
the cities of judah they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep 
and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the lord 
their god and laid them by heaps 
in the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps 
and finished them in the seventh month 
and when hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps they 
blessed the lord and his people israel 
then hezekiah questioned with the priests and the levites 
concerning the heaps 
and azariah the chief priest of the house of zadok answered him 
and said since the people began to bring the offerings into the house 
of the lord we have had enough to eat and have left plenty for the 
lord hath blessed his people and that which is left is this great 
store 
then hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the 
lord and they prepared them and brought in the offerings and 
the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully over which cononiah 
the levite was ruler and shimei his brother was the next 
and jehiel and azaziah and nahath and asahel and jerimoth 
and jozabad and eliel and ismachiah and mahath and benaiah were 
overseers under the hand of cononiah and shimei his brother at the 
commandment of hezekiah the king and azariah the ruler of the house 
of god 
and kore the son of imnah the levite the porter toward the 
east was over the freewill offerings of god to distribute the 
oblations of the lord and the most holy things 
and next him were eden and miniamin and jeshua and shemaiah 
amariah and shecaniah in the cities of the priests in their set 
office to give to their brethren by courses as well to the great as 
to the small beside their genealogy of males from three years 
old and upward even unto every one that entereth into the house of 
the lord his daily portion for their service in their charges 
according to their courses both to the genealogy of the priests 
by the house of their fathers and the levites from twenty years old 
and upward in their charges by their courses and to the 
genealogy of all their little ones their wives and their sons and 
their daughters through all the congregation for in their set office 
they sanctified themselves in holiness also of the sons of 
aaron the priests which were in the fields of the suburbs of their 
cities in every several city the men that were expressed by name to 
give portions to all the males among the priests and to all that were 
reckoned by genealogies among the levites 
and thus did hezekiah throughout all judah and wrought that 
which was good and right and truth before the lord his god 
and in every work that he began in the service of the house of 
god and in the law and in the commandments to seek his god he did 
it with all his heart and prospered 
after these things and the establishment thereof sennacherib 
king of assyria came and entered into judah and encamped against the 
fenced cities and thought to win them for himself 
and when hezekiah saw that sennacherib was come and that he was 
purposed to fight against jerusalem he took counsel with his 
princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which 
were without the city and they did help him 
so there was gathered much people together who stopped all the 
fountains and the brook that ran through the midst of the land 
saying why should the kings of assyria come and find much water 
also he strengthened himself and built up all the wall that was 
broken and raised it up to the towers and another wall without and 
repaired millo in the city of david and made darts and shields in 
abundance 
and he set captains of war over the people and gathered them 
together to him in the street of the gate of the city and spake 
comfortably to them saying be strong and courageous be not 
afraid nor dismayed for the king of assyria nor for all the multitude 
that is with him for there be more with us than with him with 
him is an arm of flesh but with us is the lord our god to help us 
and to fight our battles and the people rested themselves upon the 
words of hezekiah king of judah 
after this did sennacherib king of assyria send his servants to 
jerusalem but he himself laid siege against lachish and all his 
power with him unto hezekiah king of judah and unto all judah that 
were at jerusalem saying thus saith sennacherib king of 
assyria whereon do ye trust that ye abide in the siege in jerusalem 
doth not hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by 
famine and by thirst saying the lord our god shall deliver us out of 
the hand of the king of assyria hath not the same hezekiah 
taken away his high places and his altars and commanded judah and 
jerusalem saying ye shall worship before one altar and burn incense 
upon it know ye not what i and my fathers have done unto all 
the people of other lands were the gods of the nations of those lands 
any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand who was 
there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly 
destroyed that could deliver his people out of mine hand that your 
god should be able to deliver you out of mine hand now 
therefore let not hezekiah deceive you nor persuade you on this 
manner neither yet believe him for no god of any nation or kingdom 
was able to deliver his people out of mine hand and out of the hand 
of my fathers how much less shall your god deliver you out of mine 
hand and his servants spake yet more against the lord god and 
against his servant hezekiah 
he wrote also letters to rail on the lord god of israel and to 
speak against him saying as the gods of the nations of other lands 
have not delivered their people out of mine hand so shall not the god 
of hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand 
then they cried with a loud voice in the jews speech unto the 
people of jerusalem that were on the wall to affright them and to 
trouble them that they might take the city 
and they spake against the god of jerusalem as against the gods 
of the people of the earth which were the work of the hands of man 
and for this because hezekiah the king and the prophet isaiah the 
son of amoz prayed and cried to heaven 
and the lord sent an angel which cut off all the mighty men of 
valour and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of 
assyria so he returned with shame of face to his own land and when 
he was come into the house of his god they that came forth of his own 
bowels slew him there with the sword 
thus the lord saved hezekiah and the inhabitants of jerusalem 
from the hand of sennacherib the king of assyria and from the hand of 
all other and guided them on every side 
and many brought gifts unto the lord to jerusalem and presents 
to hezekiah king of judah so that he was magnified in the sight of 
all nations from thenceforth 
in those days hezekiah was sick to the death and prayed unto 
the lord and he spake unto him and he gave him a sign 
but hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done 
unto him for his heart was lifted up therefore there was wrath upon 
him and upon judah and jerusalem 
notwithstanding hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his 
heart both he and the inhabitants of jerusalem so that the wrath of 
the lord came not upon them in the days of hezekiah 
and hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour and he made 
himself treasuries for silver and for gold and for precious stones 
and for spices and for shields and for all manner of pleasant 
jewels storehouses also for the increase of corn and wine and 
oil and stalls for all manner of beasts and cotes for flocks 
moreover he provided him cities and possessions of flocks and 
herds in abundance for god had given him substance very much 
this same hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of gihon 
and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of david 
and hezekiah prospered in all his works 
howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of 
babylon who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was done in 
the land god left him to try him that he might know all that was in 
his heart 
now the rest of the acts of hezekiah and his goodness behold 
they are written in the vision of isaiah the prophet the son of amoz 
and in the book of the kings of judah and israel 
and hezekiah slept with his fathers and they buried him in the 
chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of david and all judah and the 
inhabitants of jerusalem did him honour at his death and manasseh his 
son reigned in his stead 
manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign and he 
reigned fifty and five years in jerusalem but did that which was 
evil in the sight of the lord like unto the abominations of the 
heathen whom the lord had cast out before the children of israel 
for he built again the high places which hezekiah his father had 
broken down and he reared up altars for baalim and made groves and 
worshipped all the host of heaven and served them 
also he built altars in the house of the lord whereof the lord 
had said in jerusalem shall my name be for ever 
and he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts 
of the house of the lord 
and he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley 
of the son of hinnom also he observed times and used enchantments 
and used witchcraft and dealt with a familiar spirit and with 
wizards he wrought much evil in the sight of the lord to provoke him 
to anger 
and he set a carved image the idol which he had made in the 
house of god of which god had said to david and to solomon his son 
in this house and in jerusalem which i have chosen before all the 
tribes of israel will i put my name for ever neither will i any 
more remove the foot of israel from out of the land which i have 
appointed for your fathers so that they will take heed to do all that 
i have commanded them according to the whole law and the statutes and 
the ordinances by the hand of moses 
so manasseh made judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem to err 
and to do worse than the heathen whom the lord had destroyed before 
the children of israel 
and the lord spake to manasseh and to his people but they 
would not hearken 
wherefore the lord brought upon them the captains of the host of 
the king of assyria which took manasseh among the thorns and bound 
him with fetters and carried him to babylon 
and when he was in affliction he besought the lord his god and 
humbled himself greatly before the god of his fathers and 
prayed unto him and he was intreated of him and heard his 
supplication and brought him again to jerusalem into his kingdom 
then manasseh knew that the lord he was god 
now after this he built a wall without the city of david on the 
west side of gihon in the valley even to the entering in at the fish 
gate and compassed about ophel and raised it up a very great height 
and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of judah 
and he took away the strange gods and the idol out of the house 
of the lord and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the 
house of the lord and in jerusalem and cast them out of the city 
and he repaired the altar of the lord and sacrificed thereon 
peace offerings and thank offerings and commanded judah to serve the 
lord god of israel 
nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places 
yet unto the lord their god only 
now the rest of the acts of manasseh and his prayer unto his 
god and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the 
lord god of israel behold they are written in the book of the kings 
of israel 
his prayer also and how god was intreated of him and all his 
sins and his trespass and the places wherein he built high places 
and set up groves and graven images before he was humbled behold 
they are written among the sayings of the seers 
so manasseh slept with his fathers and they buried him in his 
own house and amon his son reigned in his stead 
amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign and 
reigned two years in jerusalem 
but he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord as did 
manasseh his father for amon sacrificed unto all the carved images 
which manasseh his father had made and served them and humbled 
not himself before the lord as manasseh his father had humbled 
himself but amon trespassed more and more 
and his servants conspired against him and slew him in his own 
house 
but the people of the land slew all them that had conspired 
against king amon and the people of the land made josiah his son king 
in his stead 
josiah was eight years old when he began to reign and he reigned 
in jerusalem one and thirty years 
and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord and 
walked in the ways of david his father and declined neither to the 
right hand nor to the left 
for in the eighth year of his reign while he was yet young he 
began to seek after the god of david his father and in the twelfth 
year he began to purge judah and jerusalem from the high places and 
the groves and the carved images and the molten images 
and they brake down the altars of baalim in his presence and the 
images that were on high above them he cut down and the groves and 
the carved images and the molten images he brake in pieces and made 
dust of them and strowed it upon the graves of them that had 
sacrificed unto them 
and he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars and 
cleansed judah and jerusalem 
and so did he in the cities of manasseh and ephraim and simeon 
even unto naphtali with their mattocks round about 
and when he had broken down the altars and the groves and had 
beaten the graven images into powder and cut down all the idols 
throughout all the land of israel he returned to jerusalem 
now in the eighteenth year of his reign when he had purged the 
land and the house he sent shaphan the son of azaliah and maaseiah 
the governor of the city and joah the son of joahaz the recorder to 
repair the house of the lord his god 
and when they came to hilkiah the high priest they delivered the 
money that was brought into the house of god which the levites that 
kept the doors had gathered of the hand of manasseh and ephraim and 
of all the remnant of israel and of all judah and benjamin and they 
returned to jerusalem 
and they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the 
oversight of the house of the lord and they gave it to the workmen 
that wrought in the house of the lord to repair and amend the house 
even to the artificers and builders gave they it to buy hewn 
stone and timber for couplings and to floor the houses which the 
kings of judah had destroyed 
and the men did the work faithfully and the overseers of them 
were jahath and obadiah the levites of the sons of merari and 
zechariah and meshullam of the sons of the kohathites to set it 
forward and other of the levites all that could skill of instruments 
of musick 
also they were over the bearers of burdens and were overseers 
of all that wrought the work in any manner of service and of the 
levites there were scribes and officers and porters 
and when they brought out the money that was brought into the 
house of the lord hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the 
lord given by moses 
and hilkiah answered and said to shaphan the scribe i have 
found the book of the law in the house of the lord and hilkiah 
delivered the book to shaphan 
and shaphan carried the book to the king and brought the king 
word back again saying all that was committed to thy servants they 
do it 
and they have gathered together the money that was found in the 
house of the lord and have delivered it into the hand of the 
overseers and to the hand of the workmen 
then shaphan the scribe told the king saying hilkiah the 
priest hath given me a book and shaphan read it before the king 
and it came to pass when the king had heard the words of the 
law that he rent his clothes 
and the king commanded hilkiah and ahikam the son of shaphan 
and abdon the son of micah and shaphan the scribe and asaiah a 
servant of the king s saying go enquire of the lord for me 
and for them that are left in israel and in judah concerning the 
words of the book that is found for great is the wrath of the lord 
that is poured out upon us because our fathers have not kept the word 
of the lord to do after all that is written in this book 
and hilkiah and they that the king had appointed went to 
huldah the prophetess the wife of shallum the son of tikvath the son 
of hasrah keeper of the wardrobe now she dwelt in jerusalem in the 
college and they spake to her to that effect 
and she answered them thus saith the lord god of israel tell 
ye the man that sent you to me thus saith the lord behold i 
will bring evil upon this place and upon the inhabitants thereof 
even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read 
before the king of judah because they have forsaken me and 
have burned incense unto other gods that they might provoke me to 
anger with all the works of their hands therefore my wrath shall be 
poured out upon this place and shall not be quenched 
and as for the king of judah who sent you to enquire of the 
lord so shall ye say unto him thus saith the lord god of israel 
concerning the words which thou hast heard because thine heart 
was tender and thou didst humble thyself before god when thou 
heardest his words against this place and against the inhabitants 
thereof and humbledst thyself before me and didst rend thy clothes 
and weep before me i have even heard thee also saith the lord 
behold i will gather thee to thy fathers and thou shalt be 
gathered to thy grave in peace neither shall thine eyes see all the 
evil that i will bring upon this place and upon the inhabitants of 
the same so they brought the king word again 
then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of judah 
and jerusalem 
and the king went up into the house of the lord and all the men 
of judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem and the priests and the 
levites and all the people great and small and he read in their 
ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the 
house of the lord 
and the king stood in his place and made a covenant before the 
lord to walk after the lord and to keep his commandments and his 
testimonies and his statutes with all his heart and with all his 
soul to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this 
book 
and he caused all that were present in jerusalem and benjamin to 
stand to it and the inhabitants of jerusalem did according to the 
covenant of god the god of their fathers 
and josiah took away all the abominations out of all the 
countries that pertained to the children of israel and made all that 
were present in israel to serve even to serve the lord their god and 
all his days they departed not from following the lord the god of 
their fathers 
moreover josiah kept a passover unto the lord in jerusalem and 
they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month 
and he set the priests in their charges and encouraged them to 
the service of the house of the lord and said unto the levites 
that taught all israel which were holy unto the lord put the holy 
ark in the house which solomon the son of david king of israel did 
build it shall not be a burden upon your shoulders serve now the 
lord your god and his people israel and prepare yourselves by 
the houses of your fathers after your courses according to the 
writing of david king of israel and according to the writing of 
solomon his son 
and stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the 
families of the fathers of your brethren the people and after the 
division of the families of the levites 
so kill the passover and sanctify yourselves and prepare your 
brethren that they may do according to the word of the lord by the 
hand of moses 
and josiah gave to the people of the flock lambs and kids all 
for the passover offerings for all that were present to the number 
of thirty thousand and three thousand bullocks these were of the 
king s substance 
and his princes gave willingly unto the people to the priests 
and to the levites hilkiah and zechariah and jehiel rulers of the 
house of god gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two 
thousand and six hundred small cattle and three hundred oxen 
conaniah also and shemaiah and nethaneel his brethren and 
hashabiah and jeiel and jozabad chief of the levites gave unto the 
levites for passover offerings five thousand small cattle and five 
hundred oxen 
so the service was prepared and the priests stood in their 
place and the levites in their courses according to the king s 
commandment 
and they killed the passover and the priests sprinkled the 
blood from their hands and the levites flayed them 
and they removed the burnt offerings that they might give 
according to the divisions of the families of the people to offer 
unto the lord as it is written in the book of moses and so did they 
with the oxen 
and they roasted the passover with fire according to the 
ordinance but the other holy offerings sod they in pots and in 
caldrons and in pans and divided them speedily among all the people 
and afterward they made ready for themselves and for the 
priests because the priests the sons of aaron were busied in offering 
of burnt offerings and the fat until night therefore the levites 
prepared for themselves and for the priests the sons of aaron 
and the singers the sons of asaph were in their place according 
to the commandment of david and asaph and heman and jeduthun the 
king s seer and the porters waited at every gate they might not 
depart from their service for their brethren the levites prepared for 
them 
so all the service of the lord was prepared the same day to 
keep the passover and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the 
lord according to the commandment of king josiah 
and the children of israel that were present kept the passover 
at that time and the feast of unleavened bread seven days 
and there was no passover like to that kept in israel from the 
days of samuel the prophet neither did all the kings of israel keep 
such a passover as josiah kept and the priests and the levites and 
all judah and israel that were present and the inhabitants of 
jerusalem 
in the eighteenth year of the reign of josiah was this passover 
kept 
after all this when josiah had prepared the temple necho king 
of egypt came up to fight against charchemish by euphrates and josiah 
went out against him 
but he sent ambassadors to him saying what have i to do with 
thee thou king of judah i come not against thee this day but 
against the house wherewith i have war for god commanded me to make 
haste forbear thee from meddling with god who is with me that he 
destroy thee not 
nevertheless josiah would not turn his face from him but 
disguised himself that he might fight with him and hearkened not 
unto the words of necho from the mouth of god and came to fight in 
the valley of megiddo 
and the archers shot at king josiah and the king said to his 
servants have me away for i am sore wounded 
his servants therefore took him out of that chariot and put him 
in the second chariot that he had and they brought him to jerusalem 
and he died and was buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathers 
and all judah and jerusalem mourned for josiah 
and jeremiah lamented for josiah and all the singing men and 
the singing women spake of josiah in their lamentations to this day 
and made them an ordinance in israel and behold they are written in 
the lamentations 
now the rest of the acts of josiah and his goodness according 
to that which was written in the law of the lord and his deeds 
first and last behold they are written in the book of the kings of 
israel and judah 
then the people of the land took jehoahaz the son of josiah and 
made him king in his father s stead in jerusalem 
jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign 
and he reigned three months in jerusalem 
and the king of egypt put him down at jerusalem and condemned 
the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold 
and the king of egypt made eliakim his brother king over judah 
and jerusalem and turned his name to jehoiakim and necho took 
jehoahaz his brother and carried him to egypt 
jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign 
and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem and he did that which was 
evil in the sight of the lord his god 
against him came up nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and bound him 
in fetters to carry him to babylon 
nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the 
lord to babylon and put them in his temple at babylon 
now the rest of the acts of jehoiakim and his abominations which 
he did and that which was found in him behold they are written in 
the book of the kings of israel and judah and jehoiachin his son 
reigned in his stead 
jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign and he 
reigned three months and ten days in jerusalem and he did that which 
was evil in the sight of the lord 
and when the year was expired king nebuchadnezzar sent and 
brought him to babylon with the goodly vessels of the house of the 
lord and made zedekiah his brother king over judah and jerusalem 
zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign 
and reigned eleven years in jerusalem 
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord his god 
and humbled not himself before jeremiah the prophet speaking from the 
mouth of the lord 
and he also rebelled against king nebuchadnezzar who had made 
him swear by god but he stiffened his neck and hardened his heart 
from turning unto the lord god of israel 
moreover all the chief of the priests and the people 
transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen and 
polluted the house of the lord which he had hallowed in jerusalem 
and the lord god of their fathers sent to them by his 
messengers rising up betimes and sending because he had compassion 
on his people and on his dwelling place but they mocked the 
messengers of god and despised his words and misused his prophets 
until the wrath of the lord arose against his people till there was 
no remedy 
therefore he brought upon them the king of the chaldees who 
slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary 
and had no compassion upon young man or maiden old man or him that 
stooped for age he gave them all into his hand 
and all the vessels of the house of god great and small and 
the treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of the king 
and of his princes all these he brought to babylon 
and they burnt the house of god and brake down the wall of 
jerusalem and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire and destroyed 
all the goodly vessels thereof 
and them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to 
babylon where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign 
of the kingdom of persia to fulfil the word of the lord by the 
mouth of jeremiah until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths for as 
long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath to fulfil threescore and 
ten years 
now in the first year of cyrus king of persia that the word of 
the lord spoken by the mouth of jeremiah might be accomplished the 
lord stirred up the spirit of cyrus king of persia that he made a 
proclamation throughout all his kingdom and put it also in writing 
saying thus saith cyrus king of persia all the kingdoms of the 
earth hath the lord god of heaven given me and he hath charged me to 
build him an house in jerusalem which is in judah who is there among 
you of all his people the lord his god be with him and let him go up 
ezra 
now in the first year of cyrus king of persia that the word of 
the lord by the mouth of jeremiah might be fulfilled the lord stirred 
up the spirit of cyrus king of persia that he made a proclamation 
throughout all his kingdom and put it also in writing saying 
thus saith cyrus king of persia the lord god of heaven hath given me 
all the kingdoms of the earth and he hath charged me to build him an 
house at jerusalem which is in judah 
who is there among you of all his people his god be with him and 
let him go up to jerusalem which is in judah and build the house of 
the lord god of israel he is the god which is in jerusalem 
and whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth let the 
men of his place help him with silver and with gold and with goods 
and with beasts beside the freewill offering for the house of god 
that is in jerusalem 
then rose up the chief of the fathers of judah and benjamin and 
the priests and the levites with all them whose spirit god had 
raised to go up to build the house of the lord which is in jerusalem 
and all they that were about them strengthened their hands with 
vessels of silver with gold with goods and with beasts and with 
precious things beside all that was willingly offered 
also cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the 
lord which nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of jerusalem and had 
put them in the house of his gods even those did cyrus king of 
persia bring forth by the hand of mithredath the treasurer and 
numbered them unto sheshbazzar the prince of judah 
and this is the number of them thirty chargers of gold a 
thousand chargers of silver nine and twenty knives thirty 
basons of gold silver basons of a second sort four hundred and ten 
and other vessels a thousand 
all the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four 
hundred all these did sheshbazzar bring up with them of the captivity 
that were brought up from babylon unto jerusalem 
now these are the children of the province that went up out of the 
captivity of those which had been carried away whom nebuchadnezzar 
the king of babylon had carried away unto babylon and came again unto 
jerusalem and judah every one unto his city which came with

all the nethinims and the children of solomon s servants were 
three hundred ninety and two 
and these were they which went up from telmelah telharsa 
cherub addan and immer but they could not shew their father s 
house and their seed whether they were of israel the children 
of delaiah the children of tobiah the children of nekoda six 
hundred fifty and two 
and of the children of the priests the children of habaiah the 
children of koz the children of barzillai which took a wife of the 
daughters of barzillai the gileadite and was called after their name 
these sought their register among those that were reckoned by 
genealogy but they were not found therefore were they as polluted 
put from the priesthood 
and the tirshatha said unto them that they should not eat of the 
most holy things till there stood up a priest with urim and with 
thummim 
the whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three 
hundred and threescore beside their servants and their maids of 
whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven and 
there were among them two hundred singing men and singing women 
their horses were seven hundred thirty and six their mules two 
hundred forty and five their camels four hundred thirty and 
five their asses six thousand seven hundred and twenty 
and some of the chief of the fathers when they came to the house 
of the lord which is at jerusalem offered freely for the house of god 
to set it up in his place they gave after their ability unto the 
treasure of the work threescore and one thousand drams of gold and 
five thousand pound of silver and one hundred priests garments 
so the priests and the levites and some of the people and the 
singers and the porters and the nethinims dwelt in their cities 
and all israel in their cities 
and when the seventh month was come and the children of israel 
were in the cities the people gathered themselves together as one man 
to jerusalem 
then stood up jeshua the son of jozadak and his brethren the 
priests and zerubbabel the son of shealtiel and his brethren and 
builded the altar of the god of israel to offer burnt offerings 
thereon as it is written in the law of moses the man of god 
and they set the altar upon his bases for fear was upon them 
because of the people of those countries and they offered burnt 
offerings thereon unto the lord even burnt offerings morning and 
evening 
they kept also the feast of tabernacles as it is written and 
offered the daily burnt offerings by number according to the custom 
as the duty of every day required and afterward offered the 
continual burnt offering both of the new moons and of all the set 
feasts of the lord that were consecrated and of every one that 
willingly offered a freewill offering unto the lord 
from the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt 
offerings unto the lord but the foundation of the temple of the lord 
was not yet laid 
they gave money also unto the masons and to the carpenters and 
meat and drink and oil unto them of zidon and to them of tyre to 
bring cedar trees from lebanon to the sea of joppa according to the 
grant that they had of cyrus king of persia 
now in the second year of their coming unto the house of god at 
jerusalem in the second month began zerubbabel the son of shealtiel 
and jeshua the son of jozadak and the remnant of their brethren the 
priests and the levites and all they that were come out of the 
captivity unto jerusalem and appointed the levites from twenty years 
old and upward to set forward the work of the house of the lord 
then stood jeshua with his sons and his brethren kadmiel and his 
sons the sons of judah together to set forward the workmen in the 
house of god the sons of henadad with their sons and their brethren 
the levites 
and when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the 
lord they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets and the 
levites the sons of asaph with cymbals to praise the lord after the 
ordinance of david king of israel 
and they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks 
unto the lord because he is good for his mercy endureth for ever 
toward israel 
and all the people shouted with a great shout when they praised the 
lord because the foundation of the house of the lord was laid 
but many of the priests and levites and chief of the fathers who 
were ancient men that had seen the first house when the foundation 
of this house was laid before their eyes wept with a loud voice and 
many shouted aloud for joy so that the people could not discern 
the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the 
people for the people shouted with a loud shout and the noise was 
heard afar off 
now when the adversaries of judah and benjamin heard that the 
children of the captivity builded the temple unto the lord god of 
israel then they came to zerubbabel and to the chief of the 
fathers and said unto them let us build with you for we seek your 
god as ye do and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of 
esarhaddon king of assur which brought us up hither 
but zerubbabel and jeshua and the rest of the chief of the 
fathers of israel said unto them ye have nothing to do with us to 
build an house unto our god but we ourselves together will build unto 
the lord god of israel as king cyrus the king of persia hath 
commanded us 
then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of 
judah and troubled them in building and hired counsellors 
against them to frustrate their purpose all the days of cyrus king 
of persia even until the reign of darius king of persia 
and in the reign of ahasuerus in the beginning of his reign 
wrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of judah and 
jerusalem 
and in the days of artaxerxes wrote bishlam mithredath tabeel 
and the rest of their companions unto artaxerxes king of persia and 
the writing of the letter was written in the syrian tongue and 
interpreted in the syrian tongue 
rehum the chancellor and shimshai the scribe wrote a letter 
against jerusalem to artaxerxes the king in this sort then wrote 
rehum the chancellor and shimshai the scribe and the rest of their 
companions the dinaites the apharsathchites the tarpelites the 
apharsites the archevites the babylonians the susanchites the 
dehavites and the elamites and the rest of the nations whom the 
great and noble asnapper brought over and set in the cities of 
samaria and the rest that are on this side the river and at such a 
time 
this is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him even unto 
artaxerxes the king thy servants the men on this side the river and 
at such a time 
be it known unto the king that the jews which came up from thee 
to us are come unto jerusalem building the rebellious and the bad 
city and have set up the walls thereof and joined the foundations 
be it known now unto the king that if this city be builded and 
the walls set up again then will they not pay toll tribute and 
custom and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings 
now because we have maintenance from the king s palace and it 
was not meet for us to see the king s dishonour therefore have we 
sent and certified the king that search may be made in the book 
of the records of thy fathers so shalt thou find in the book of the 
records and know that this city is a rebellious city and hurtful 
unto kings and provinces and that they have moved sedition within the 
same of old time for which because was this city destroyed 
we certify the king that if this city be builded again and the 
walls thereof set up by this means thou shalt have no portion on this 
side the river 
then sent the king an answer unto rehum the chancellor and to 
shimshai the scribe and to the rest of their companions that dwell in 
samaria and unto the rest beyond the river peace and at such a 
time 
the letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before 
me 
and i commanded and search hath been made and it is found that 
this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings and that 
rebellion and sedition have been made therein 
there have been mighty kings also over jerusalem which have 
ruled over all countries beyond the river and toll tribute and 
custom was paid unto them 
give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease and that 
this city be not builded until another commandment shall be given 
from me 
take heed now that ye fail not to do this why should damage grow 
to the hurt of the kings now when the copy of king artaxerxes 
letter was read before rehum and shimshai the scribe and their 
companions they went up in haste to jerusalem unto the jews and made 
them to cease by force and power 
then ceased the work of the house of god which is at jerusalem 
so it ceased unto the second year of the reign of darius king of 
persia 
then the prophets haggai the prophet and zechariah the son of 
iddo prophesied unto the jews that were in judah and jerusalem in the 
name of the god of israel even unto them 
then rose up zerubbabel the son of shealtiel and jeshua the son 
of jozadak and began to build the house of god which is at jerusalem 
and with them were the prophets of god helping them 
at the same time came to them tatnai governor on this side the 
river and shetharboznai and their companions and said thus unto 
them who hath commanded you to build this house and to make up this 
wall then said we unto them after this manner what are the 
names of the men that make this building but the eye of their 
god was upon the elders of the jews that they could not because them to 
cease till the matter came to darius and then they returned answer 
by letter concerning this matter 
the copy of the letter that tatnai governor on this side the 
river and shetharboznai and his companions the apharsachites which 
were on this side the river sent unto darius the king they sent 
a letter unto him wherein was written thus unto darius the king all 
peace 
be it known unto the king that we went into the province of 
judea to the house of the great god which is builded with great 
stones and timber is laid in the walls and this work goeth fast on 
and prospereth in their hands 
then asked we those elders and said unto them thus who commanded 
you to build this house and to make up these walls we asked 
their names also to certify thee that we might write the names of 
the men that were the chief of them 
and thus they returned us answer saying we are the servants of 
the god of heaven and earth and build the house that was builded 
these many years ago which a great king of israel builded and set up 
but after that our fathers had provoked the god of heaven unto 
wrath he gave them into the hand of nebuchadnezzar the king of 
babylon the chaldean who destroyed this house and carried the 
people away into babylon 
but in the first year of cyrus the king of babylon the same king 
cyrus made a decree to build this house of god 
and the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of god 
which nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in jerusalem and 
brought them into the temple of babylon those did cyrus the king take 
out of the temple of babylon and they were delivered unto one whose 
name was sheshbazzar whom he had made governor and said unto 
him take these vessels go carry them into the temple that is in 
jerusalem and let the house of god be builded in his place 
then came the same sheshbazzar and laid the foundation of the 
house of god which is in jerusalem and since that time even until now 
hath it been in building and yet it is not finished 
now therefore if it seem good to the king let there be search 
made in the king s treasure house which is there at babylon whether 
it be so that a decree was made of cyrus the king to build this house 
of god at jerusalem and let the king send his pleasure to us 
concerning this matter 
then darius the king made a decree and search was made in the 
house of the rolls where the treasures were laid up in babylon 
and there was found at achmetha in the palace that is in the 
province of the medes a roll and therein was a record thus written 
in the first year of cyrus the king the same cyrus the king made a 
decree concerning the house of god at jerusalem let the house be 
builded the place where they offered sacrifices and let the 
foundations thereof be strongly laid the height thereof threescore 
cubits and the breadth thereof threescore cubits with three rows 
of great stones and a row of new timber and let the expenses be 
given out of the king s house and also let the golden and silver 
vessels of the house of god which nebuchadnezzar took forth out of 
the temple which is at jerusalem and brought unto babylon be 
restored and brought again unto the temple which is at jerusalem 
every one to his place and place them in the house of god 
now therefore tatnai governor beyond the river shetharboznai 
and your companions the apharsachites which are beyond the river be 
ye far from thence let the work of this house of god alone let 
the governor of the jews and the elders of the jews build this house 
of god in his place 
moreover i make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these 
jews for the building of this house of god that of the king s goods 
even of the tribute beyond the river forthwith expenses be given unto 
these men that they be not hindered 
and that which they have need of both young bullocks and rams 
and lambs for the burnt offerings of the god of heaven wheat salt 
wine and oil according to the appointment of the priests which are 
at jerusalem let it be given them day by day without fail that 
they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the god of heaven and 
pray for the life of the king and of his sons 
also i have made a decree that whosoever shall alter this word 
let timber be pulled down from his house and being set up let him be 
hanged thereon and let his house be made a dunghill for this 
and the god that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all 
kings and people that shall put to their hand to alter and to destroy 
this house of god which is at jerusalem i darius have made a decree 
let it be done with speed 
then tatnai governor on this side the river shetharboznai and 
their companions according to that which darius the king had sent so 
they did speedily 
and the elders of the jews builded and they prospered through 
the prophesying of haggai the prophet and zechariah the son of iddo 
and they builded and finished it according to the commandment of the 
god of israel and according to the commandment of cyrus and darius 
and artaxerxes king of persia 
and this house was finished on the third day of the month adar 
which was in the sixth year of the reign of darius the king 
and the children of israel the priests and the levites and the 
rest of the children of the captivity kept the dedication of this 
house of god with joy 
and offered at the dedication of this house of god an hundred 
bullocks two hundred rams four hundred lambs and for a sin offering 
for all israel twelve he goats according to the number of the tribes 
of israel 
and they set the priests in their divisions and the levites in 
their courses for the service of god which is at jerusalem as it is 
written in the book of moses 
and the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the 
fourteenth day of the first month 
for the priests and the levites were purified together all of 
them were pure and killed the passover for all the children of the 
captivity and for their brethren the priests and for themselves 
and the children of israel which were come again out of 
captivity and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the 
filthiness of the heathen of the land to seek the lord god of israel 
did eat and kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with 
joy for the lord had made them joyful and turned the heart of the 
king of assyria unto them to strengthen their hands in the work of 
the house of god the god of israel 
now after these things in the reign of artaxerxes king of persia 
ezra the son of seraiah the son of azariah the son of hilkiah 
the son of shallum the son of zadok the son of ahitub the son 
of amariah the son of azariah the son of meraioth the son of 
zerahiah the son of uzzi the son of bukki the son of abishua 
the son of phinehas the son of eleazar the son of aaron the chief 
priest this ezra went up from babylon and he was a ready scribe 
in the law of moses which the lord god of israel had given and the 
king granted him all his request according to the hand of the lord 
his god upon him 
and there went up some of the children of israel and of the 
priests and the levites and the singers and the porters and the 
nethinims unto jerusalem in the seventh year of artaxerxes the king 
and he came to jerusalem in the fifth month which was in the 
seventh year of the king 
for upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from 
babylon and on the first day of the fifth month came he to jerusalem 
according to the good hand of his god upon him 
for ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the lord and 
to do it and to teach in israel statutes and judgments 
now this is the copy of the letter that the king artaxerxes gave 
unto ezra the priest the scribe even a scribe of the words of the 
commandments of the lord and of his statutes to israel 
artaxerxes king of kings unto ezra the priest a scribe of the 
law of the god of heaven perfect peace and at such a time 
i make a decree that all they of the people of israel and of 
his priests and levites in my realm which are minded of their own 
freewill to go up to jerusalem go with thee 
forasmuch as thou art sent of the king and of his seven 
counsellors to enquire concerning judah and jerusalem according to 
the law of thy god which is in thine hand and to carry the 
silver and gold which the king and his counsellors have freely 
offered unto the god of israel whose habitation is in jerusalem 
and all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province 
of babylon with the freewill offering of the people and of the 
priests offering willingly for the house of their god which is in 
jerusalem that thou mayest buy speedily with this money 
bullocks rams lambs with their meat offerings and their drink 
offerings and offer them upon the altar of the house of your god 
which is in jerusalem 
and whatsoever shall seem good to thee and to thy brethren to 
do with the rest of the silver and the gold that do after the will of 
your god 
the vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house 
of thy god those deliver thou before the god of jerusalem 
and whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy god 
which thou shalt have occasion to bestow bestow it out of the king s 
treasure house 
and i even i artaxerxes the king do make a decree to all the 
treasurers which are beyond the river that whatsoever ezra the 
priest the scribe of the law of the god of heaven shall require of 
you it be done speedily unto an hundred talents of silver and 
to an hundred measures of wheat and to an hundred baths of wine and 
to an hundred baths of oil and salt without prescribing how much 
whatsoever is commanded by the god of heaven let it be 
diligently done for the house of the god of heaven for why should 
there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons also 
we certify you that touching any of the priests and levites singers 
porters nethinims or ministers of this house of god it shall not be 
lawful to impose toll tribute or custom upon them 
and thou ezra after the wisdom of thy god that is in thine 
hand set magistrates and judges which may judge all the people that 
are beyond the river all such as know the laws of thy god and teach 
ye them that know them not 
and whosoever will not do the law of thy god and the law of the 
king let judgment be executed speedily upon him whether it be unto 
death or to banishment or to confiscation of goods or to 
imprisonment 
blessed be the lord god of our fathers which hath put such a 
thing as this in the king s heart to beautify the house of the lord 
which is in jerusalem and hath extended mercy unto me before the 
king and his counsellors and before all the king s mighty princes 
and i was strengthened as the hand of the lord my god was upon me and 
i gathered together out of israel chief men to go up with me 
these are now the chief of their fathers and this is the 
genealogy of them that went up with me from babylon in the reign of 
artaxerxes the king 
of the sons of phinehas gershom of the sons of ithamar daniel 
of the sons of david hattush 
of the sons of shechaniah of the sons of pharosh zechariah and 
with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an hundred and fifty 
of the sons of pahathmoab elihoenai the son of zerahiah and with 
him two hundred males 
of the sons of shechaniah the son of jahaziel and with him three 
hundred males 
of the sons also of adin ebed the son of jonathan and with him 
fifty males 
and of the sons of elam jeshaiah the son of athaliah and with 
him seventy males 
and of the sons of shephatiah zebadiah the son of michael and 
with him fourscore males 
of the sons of joab obadiah the son of jehiel and with him two 
hundred and eighteen males 
and of the sons of shelomith the son of josiphiah and with him 
an hundred and threescore males 
and of the sons of bebai zechariah the son of bebai and with 
him twenty and eight males 
and of the sons of azgad johanan the son of hakkatan and with 
him an hundred and ten males 
and of the last sons of adonikam whose names are these 
eliphelet jeiel and shemaiah and with them threescore males 
of the sons also of bigvai uthai and zabbud and with them 
seventy males 
and i gathered them together to the river that runneth to ahava 
and there abode we in tents three days and i viewed the people and 
the priests and found there none of the sons of levi 
then sent i for eliezer for ariel for shemaiah and for 
elnathan and for jarib and for elnathan and for nathan and for 
zechariah and for meshullam chief men also for joiarib and for 
elnathan men of understanding 
and i sent them with commandment unto iddo the chief at the place 
casiphia and i told them what they should say unto iddo and to his 
brethren the nethinims at the place casiphia that they should bring 
unto us ministers for the house of our god 
and by the good hand of our god upon us they brought us a man of 
understanding of the sons of mahli the son of levi the son of 
israel and sherebiah with his sons and his brethren eighteen 
and hashabiah and with him jeshaiah of the sons of merari his 
brethren and their sons twenty also of the nethinims whom 
david and the princes had appointed for the service of the levites 
two hundred and twenty nethinims all of them were expressed by name 
then i proclaimed a fast there at the river of ahava that we 
might afflict ourselves before our god to seek of him a right way for 
us and for our little ones and for all our substance 
for i was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and 
horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way because we had 
spoken unto the king saying the hand of our god is upon all them for 
good that seek him but his power and his wrath is against all them 
that forsake him 
so we fasted and besought our god for this and he was intreated 
of us 
then i separated twelve of the chief of the priests sherebiah 
hashabiah and ten of their brethren with them and weighed unto 
them the silver and the gold and the vessels even the offering of 
the house of our god which the king and his counsellors and his 
lords and all israel there present had offered i even weighed 
unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver and silver 
vessels an hundred talents and of gold an hundred talents also 
twenty basons of gold of a thousand drams and two vessels of fine 
copper precious as gold 
and i said unto them ye are holy unto the lord the vessels are 
holy also and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto 
the lord god of your fathers 
watch ye and keep them until ye weigh them before the chief of 
the priests and the levites and chief of the fathers of israel at 
jerusalem in the chambers of the house of the lord 
so took the priests and the levites the weight of the silver and 
the gold and the vessels to bring them to jerusalem unto the house 
of our god 
then we departed from the river of ahava on the twelfth day of 
the first month to go unto jerusalem and the hand of our god was 
upon us and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and of such 
as lay in wait by the way 
and we came to jerusalem and abode there three days 
now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels 
weighed in the house of our god by the hand of meremoth the son of 
uriah the priest and with him was eleazar the son of phinehas and 
with them was jozabad the son of jeshua and noadiah the son of 
binnui levites by number and by weight of every one and all 
the weight was written at that time 
also the children of those that had been carried away which were 
come out of the captivity offered burnt offerings unto the god of 
israel twelve bullocks for all israel ninety and six rams seventy 
and seven lambs twelve he goats for a sin offering all this was a 
burnt offering unto the lord 
and they delivered the king s commissions unto the king s 
lieutenants and to the governors on this side the river and they 
furthered the people and the house of god 
now when these things were done the princes came to me saying 
the people of israel and the priests and the levites have not 
separated themselves from the people of the lands doing according to 
their abominations even of the canaanites the hittites the 
perizzites the jebusites the ammonites the moabites the egyptians 
and the amorites 
for they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for 
their sons so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the 
people of those lands yea the hand of the princes and rulers hath 
been chief in this trespass 
and when i heard this thing i rent my garment and my mantle and 
plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard and sat down 
astonied 
then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words 
of the god of israel because of the transgression of those that had 
been carried away and i sat astonied until the evening sacrifice 
and at the evening sacrifice i arose up from my heaviness and 
having rent my garment and my mantle i fell upon my knees and spread 
out my hands unto the lord my god and said o my god i am 
ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee my god for our 
iniquities are increased over our head and our trespass is grown up 
unto the heavens 
since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass 
unto this day and for our iniquities have we our kings and our 
priests been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands to 
the sword to captivity and to a spoil and to confusion of face as 
it is this day 
and now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the lord 
our god to leave us a remnant to escape and to give us a nail in his 
holy place that our god may lighten our eyes and give us a little 
reviving in our bondage 
for we were bondmen yet our god hath not forsaken us in our 
bondage but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of 
persia to give us a reviving to set up the house of our god and to 
repair the desolations thereof and to give us a wall in judah and in 
jerusalem 
and now o our god what shall we say after this for we have 
forsaken thy commandments which thou hast commanded by thy 
servants the prophets saying the land unto which ye go to possess 
it is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands 
with their abominations which have filled it from one end to another 
with their uncleanness 
now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons neither 
take their daughters unto your sons nor seek their peace or their 
wealth for ever that ye may be strong and eat the good of the land 
and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever 
and after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds and for 
our great trespass seeing that thou our god hast punished us less 
than our iniquities deserve and hast given us such deliverance as 
this should we again break thy commandments and join in 
affinity with the people of these abominations wouldest not thou be 
angry with us till thou hadst consumed us so that there should be no 
remnant nor escaping o lord god of israel thou art righteous 
for we remain yet escaped as it is this day behold we are before 
thee in our trespasses for we cannot stand before thee because of 
this 
now when ezra had prayed and when he had confessed weeping and 
casting himself down before the house of god there assembled unto him 
out of israel a very great congregation of men and women and children 
for the people wept very sore 
and shechaniah the son of jehiel one of the sons of elam 
answered and said unto ezra we have trespassed against our god and 
have taken strange wives of the people of the land yet now there is 
hope in israel concerning this thing 
now therefore let us make a covenant with our god to put away all 
the wives and such as are born of them according to the counsel of 
my lord and of those that tremble at the commandment of our god and 
let it be done according to the law 
arise for this matter belongeth unto thee we also will be with 
thee be of good courage and do it 
then arose ezra and made the chief priests the levites and all 
israel to swear that they should do according to this word and they 
sware 
then ezra rose up from before the house of god and went into the 
chamber of johanan the son of eliashib and when he came thither he 
did eat no bread nor drink water for he mourned because of the 
transgression of them that had been carried away 
and they made proclamation throughout judah and jerusalem unto 
all the children of the captivity that they should gather themselves 
together unto jerusalem and that whosoever would not come within 
three days according to the counsel of the princes and the elders 
all his substance should be forfeited and himself separated from the 
congregation of those that had been carried away 
then all the men of judah and benjamin gathered themselves 
together unto jerusalem within three days it was the ninth month on 
the twentieth day of the month and all the people sat in the street 
of the house of god trembling because of this matter and for the 
great rain 
and ezra the priest stood up and said unto them ye have 
transgressed and have taken strange wives to increase the trespass 
of israel 
now therefore make confession unto the lord god of your fathers 
and do his pleasure and separate yourselves from the people of the 
land and from the strange wives 
then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice 
as thou hast said so must we do 
but the people are many and it is a time of much rain and we 
are not able to stand without neither is this a work of one day or 
two for we are many that have transgressed in this thing 
let now our rulers of all the congregation stand and let all 
them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed 
times and with them the elders of every city and the judges thereof 
until the fierce wrath of our god for this matter be turned from us 
only jonathan the son of asahel and jahaziah the son of tikvah 
were employed about this matter and meshullam and shabbethai the 
levite helped them 
and the children of the captivity did so and ezra the priest 
with certain chief of the fathers after the house of their fathers 
and all of them by their names were separated and sat down in the 
first day of the tenth month to examine the matter 
and they made an end with all the men that had taken strange 
wives by the first day of the first month 
and among the sons of the priests there were found that had 
taken strange wives namely of the sons of jeshua the son of jozadak 
and his brethren maaseiah and eliezer and jarib and gedaliah 
and they gave their hands that they would put away their wives 
and being guilty they offered a ram of the flock for their trespass 
and of the sons of immer hanani and zebadiah 
and of the sons of harim maaseiah and elijah and shemaiah 
and jehiel and uzziah 
and of the sons of pashur elioenai maaseiah ishmael

and joel benaiah 
all these had taken strange wives and some of them had wives by 
whom they had children 
the book of nehemiah 
the words of nehemiah the son of hachaliah and it came to pass 
in the month chisleu in the twentieth year as i was in shushan the 
palace that hanani one of my brethren came he and certain men 
of judah and i asked them concerning the jews that had escaped which 
were left of the captivity and concerning jerusalem 
and they said unto me the remnant that are left of the captivity 
there in the province are in great affliction and reproach the wall 
of jerusalem also is broken down and the gates thereof are burned 
with fire 
and it came to pass when i heard these words that i sat down and 
wept and mourned certain days and fasted and prayed before the god 
of heaven and said i beseech thee o lord god of heaven the 
great and terrible god that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that 
love him and observe his commandments let thine ear now be 
attentive and thine eyes open that thou mayest hear the prayer of 
thy servant which i pray before thee now day and night for the 
children of israel thy servants and confess the sins of the children 
of israel which we have sinned against thee both i and my father s 
house have sinned 
we have dealt very corruptly against thee and have not kept the 
commandments nor the statutes nor the judgments which thou 
commandedst thy servant moses 
remember i beseech thee the word that thou commandedst thy 
servant moses saying if ye transgress i will scatter you abroad 
among the nations but if ye turn unto me and keep my 
commandments and do them though there were of you cast out unto the 
uttermost part of the heaven yet will i gather them from thence and 
will bring them unto the place that i have chosen to set my name 
there 
now these are thy servants and thy people whom thou hast 
redeemed by thy great power and by thy strong hand 
o lord i beseech thee let now thine ear be attentive to the 
prayer of thy servant and to the prayer of thy servants who desire 
to fear thy name and prosper i pray thee thy servant this day and 
grant him mercy in the sight of this man for i was the king s 
cupbearer 
and it came to pass in the month nisan in the twentieth year of 
artaxerxes the king that wine was before him and i took up the wine 
and gave it unto the king now i had not been beforetime sad in his 
presence 
wherefore the king said unto me why is thy countenance sad 
seeing thou art not sick this is nothing else but sorrow of heart 
then i was very sore afraid and said unto the king let the king 
live for ever why should not my countenance be sad when the city 
the place of my fathers sepulchres lieth waste and the gates 
thereof are consumed with fire then the king said unto me for 
what dost thou make request so i prayed to the god of heaven 
and i said unto the king if it please the king and if thy 
servant have found favour in thy sight that thou wouldest send me 
unto judah unto the city of my fathers sepulchres that i may build 
it 
and the king said unto me the queen also sitting by him for 
how long shall thy journey be and when wilt thou return so it 
pleased the king to send me and i set him a time 
moreover i said unto the king if it please the king let letters 
be given me to the governors beyond the river that they may convey me 
over till i come into judah and a letter unto asaph the keeper of 
the king s forest that he may give me timber to make beams for the 
gates of the palace which appertained to the house and for the wall 
of the city and for the house that i shall enter into and the king 
granted me according to the good hand of my god upon me 
then i came to the governors beyond the river and gave them the 
king s letters now the king had sent captains of the army and 
horsemen with me 
when sanballat the horonite and tobiah the servant the 
ammonite heard of it it grieved them exceedingly that there was come 
a man to seek the welfare of the children of israel 
so i came to jerusalem and was there three days 
and i arose in the night i and some few men with me neither 
told i any man what my god had put in my heart to do at jerusalem 
neither was there any beast with me save the beast that i rode upon 
and i went out by night by the gate of the valley even before 
the dragon well and to the dung port and viewed the walls of 
jerusalem which were broken down and the gates thereof were consumed 
with fire 
then i went on to the gate of the fountain and to the king s 
pool but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass 
then went i up in the night by the brook and viewed the wall 
and turned back and entered by the gate of the valley and so 
returned 
and the rulers knew not whither i went or what i did neither 
had i as yet told it to the jews nor to the priests nor to the 
nobles nor to the rulers nor to the rest that did the work 
then said i unto them ye see the distress that we are in how 
jerusalem lieth waste and the gates thereof are burned with fire 
come and let us build up the wall of jerusalem that we be no more a 
reproach 
then i told them of the hand of my god which was good upon me as 
also the king s words that he had spoken unto me and they said let 
us rise up and build so they strengthened their hands for this good 
work 
but when sanballat the horonite and tobiah the servant the 
ammonite and geshem the arabian heard it they laughed us to scorn 
and despised us and said what is this thing that ye do will ye 
rebel against the king then answered i them and said unto 
them the god of heaven he will prosper us therefore we his servants 
will arise and build but ye have no portion nor right nor memorial 
in jerusalem 
then eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the 
priests and they builded the sheep gate they sanctified it and set 
up the doors of it even unto the tower of meah they sanctified it 
unto the tower of hananeel 
and next unto him builded the men of jericho and next to them

and to the going up of the corner 
and between the going up of the corner unto the sheep gate 
repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants 
but it came to pass that when sanballat heard that we builded the 
wall he was wroth and took great indignation and mocked the jews 
and he spake before his brethren and the army of samaria and 
said what do these feeble jews will they fortify themselves will 
they sacrifice will they make an end in a day will they revive the 
stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned now 
tobiah the ammonite was by him and he said even that which they 
build if a fox go up he shall even break down their stone wall 
hear o our god for we are despised and turn their reproach upon 
their own head and give them for a prey in the land of captivity 
and cover not their iniquity and let not their sin be blotted out 
from before thee for they have provoked thee to anger before the 
builders 
so built we the wall and all the wall was joined together unto 
the half thereof for the people had a mind to work 
but it came to pass that when sanballat and tobiah and the 
arabians and the ammonites and the ashdodites heard that the walls 
of jerusalem were made up and that the breaches began to be stopped 
then they were very wroth and conspired all of them together to 
come and to fight against jerusalem and to hinder it 
nevertheless we made our prayer unto our god and set a watch 
against them day and night because of them 
and judah said the strength of the bearers of burdens is 
decayed and there is much rubbish so that we are not able to build 
the wall 
and our adversaries said they shall not know neither see till 
we come in the midst among them and slay them and because the work to 
cease 
and it came to pass that when the jews which dwelt by them came 
they said unto us ten times from all places whence ye shall return 
unto us they will be upon you 
therefore set i in the lower places behind the wall and on the 
higher places i even set the people after their families with their 
swords their spears and their bows 
and i looked and rose up and said unto the nobles and to the 
rulers and to the rest of the people be not ye afraid of them 
remember the lord which is great and terrible and fight for your 
brethren your sons and your daughters your wives and your houses 
and it came to pass when our enemies heard that it was known 
unto us and god had brought their counsel to nought that we returned 
all of us to the wall every one unto his work 
and it came to pass from that time forth that the half of my 
servants wrought in the work and the other half of them held both the 
spears the shields and the bows and the habergeons and the rulers 
were behind all the house of judah 
they which builded on the wall and they that bare burdens with 
those that laded every one with one of his hands wrought in the work 
and with the other hand held a weapon 
for the builders every one had his sword girded by his side and 
so builded and he that sounded the trumpet was by me 
and i said unto the nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of 
the people the work is great and large and we are separated upon the 
wall one far from another 
in what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet resort 
ye thither unto us our god shall fight for us 
so we laboured in the work and half of them held the spears from 
the rising of the morning till the stars appeared 
likewise at the same time said i unto the people let every one 
with his servant lodge within jerusalem that in the night they may be 
a guard to us and labour on the day 
so neither i nor my brethren nor my servants nor the men of 
the guard which followed me none of us put off our clothes saving 
that every one put them off for washing 
and there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against 
their brethren the jews 
for there were that said we our sons and our daughters are 
many therefore we take up corn for them that we may eat and live 
some also there were that said we have mortgaged our lands 
vineyards and houses that we might buy corn because of the dearth 
there were also that said we have borrowed money for the king s 
tribute and that upon our lands and vineyards 
yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren our children as 
their children and lo we bring into bondage our sons and our 
daughters to be servants and some of our daughters are brought unto 
bondage already neither is it in our power to redeem them for other 
men have our lands and vineyards 
and i was very angry when i heard their cry and these words 
then i consulted with myself and i rebuked the nobles and the 
rulers and said unto them ye exact usury every one of his brother 
and i set a great assembly against them 
and i said unto them we after our ability have redeemed our 
brethren the jews which were sold unto the heathen and will ye even 
sell your brethren or shall they be sold unto us then held they 
their peace and found nothing to answer 
also i said it is not good that ye do ought ye not to walk in 
the fear of our god because of the reproach of the heathen our 
enemies i likewise and my brethren and my servants might 
exact of them money and corn i pray you let us leave off this usury 
restore i pray you to them even this day their lands their 
vineyards their oliveyards and their houses also the hundredth part 
of the money and of the corn the wine and the oil that ye exact of 
them 
then said they we will restore them and will require nothing of 
them so will we do as thou sayest then i called the priests and 
took an oath of them that they should do according to this promise 
also i shook my lap and said so god shake out every man from 
his house and from his labour that performeth not this promise even 
thus be he shaken out and emptied and all the congregation said 
amen and praised the lord and the people did according to this 
promise 
moreover from the time that i was appointed to be their governor 
in the land of judah from the twentieth year even unto the two and 
thirtieth year of artaxerxes the king that is twelve years i and my 
brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor 
but the former governors that had been before me were chargeable 
unto the people and had taken of them bread and wine beside forty 
shekels of silver yea even their servants bare rule over the people 
but so did not i because of the fear of god 
yea also i continued in the work of this wall neither bought we 
any land and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work 
moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the jews 
and rulers beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that 
are about us 
now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six 
choice sheep also fowls were prepared for me and once in ten days 
store of all sorts of wine yet for all this required not i the bread 
of the governor because the bondage was heavy upon this people 
think upon me my god for good according to all that i have 
done for this people 
now it came to pass when sanballat and tobiah and geshem the 
arabian and the rest of our enemies heard that i had builded the 
wall and that there was no breach left therein though at that time 
i had not set up the doors upon the gates that sanballat and 
geshem sent unto me saying come let us meet together in some one of 
the villages in the plain of ono but they thought to do me mischief 
and i sent messengers unto them saying i am doing a great work 
so that i cannot come down why should the work cease whilst i leave 
it and come down to you yet they sent unto me four times after 
this sort and i answered them after the same manner 
then sent sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth 
time with an open letter in his hand wherein was written it is 
reported among the heathen and gashmu saith it that thou and the 
jews think to rebel for which because thou buildest the wall that thou 
mayest be their king according to these words 
and thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at 
jerusalem saying there is a king in judah and now shall it be 
reported to the king according to these words come now therefore and 
let us take counsel together 
then i sent unto him saying there are no such things done as 
thou sayest but thou feignest them out of thine own heart 
for they all made us afraid saying their hands shall be weakened 
from the work that it be not done now therefore o god strengthen 
my hands 
afterward i came unto the house of shemaiah the son of delaiah 
the son of mehetabeel who was shut up and he said let us meet 
together in the house of god within the temple and let us shut the 
doors of the temple for they will come to slay thee yea in the 
night will they come to slay thee 
and i said should such a man as i flee and who is there that 
being as i am would go into the temple to save his life i will not 
go in 
and lo i perceived that god had not sent him but that he 
pronounced this prophecy against me for tobiah and sanballat had 
hired him 
therefore was he hired that i should be afraid and do so and 
sin and that they might have matter for an evil report that they 
might reproach me 
my god think thou upon tobiah and sanballat according to these 
their works and on the prophetess noadiah and the rest of the 
prophets that would have put me in fear 
so the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month 
elul in fifty and two days 
and it came to pass that when all our enemies heard thereof and 
all the heathen that were about us saw these things they were much 
cast down in their own eyes for they perceived that this work was 
wrought of our god 
moreover in those days the nobles of judah sent many letters unto 
tobiah and the letters of tobiah came unto them 
for there were many in judah sworn unto him because he was the 
son in law of shechaniah the son of arah and his son johanan had 
taken the daughter of meshullam the son of berechiah 
also they reported his good deeds before me and uttered my words 
to him and tobiah sent letters to put me in fear 
now it came to pass when the wall was built and i had set up the 
doors and the porters and the singers and the levites were appointed 
that i gave my brother hanani and hananiah the ruler of the 
palace charge over jerusalem for he was a faithful man and feared 
god above many 
and i said unto them let not the gates of jerusalem be opened 
until the sun be hot and while they stand by let them shut the 
doors and bar them and appoint watches of the inhabitants of 
jerusalem every one in his watch and every one to be over against 
his house 
now the city was large and great but the people were few therein 
and the houses were not builded 
and my god put into mine heart to gather together the nobles and 
the rulers and the people that they might be reckoned by genealogy 
and i found a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the 
first and found written therein these are the children of the 
province that went up out of the captivity of those that had been 
carried away whom nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon had carried 
away and came again to jerusalem and to judah every one unto his

the children of barzillai which took one of the daughters of 
barzillai the gileadite to wife and was called after their name 
these sought their register among those that were reckoned by 
genealogy but it was not found therefore were they as polluted put 
from the priesthood 
and the tirshatha said unto them that they should not eat of the 
most holy things till there stood up a priest with urim and thummim 
the whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three 
hundred and threescore beside their manservants and their 
maidservants of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty 
and seven and they had two hundred forty and five singing men and 
singing women 
their horses seven hundred thirty and six their mules two 
hundred forty and five their camels four hundred thirty and 
five six thousand seven hundred and twenty asses 
and some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work the 
tirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold fifty basons 
five hundred and thirty priests garments 
and some of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of the 
work twenty thousand drams of gold and two thousand and two hundred 
pound of silver 
and that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand 
drams of gold and two thousand pound of silver and threescore and 
seven priests garments 
so the priests and the levites and the porters and the 
singers and some of the people and the nethinims and all israel 
dwelt in their cities and when the seventh month came the children 
of israel were in their cities 
and all the people gathered themselves together as one man into 
the street that was before the water gate and they spake unto ezra 
the scribe to bring the book of the law of moses which the lord had 
commanded to israel 
and ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both 
of men and women and all that could hear with understanding upon the 
first day of the seventh month 
and he read therein before the street that was before the water 
gate from the morning until midday before the men and the women and 
those that could understand and the ears of all the people were 
attentive unto the book of the law 
and ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood which they had 
made for the purpose and beside him stood mattithiah and shema and 
anaiah and urijah and hilkiah and maaseiah on his right hand and 
on his left hand pedaiah and mishael and malchiah and hashum and 
hashbadana zechariah and meshullam 
and ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people for he 
was above all the people and when he opened it all the people stood 
up and ezra blessed the lord the great god and all the people 
answered amen amen with lifting up their hands and they bowed 
their heads and worshipped the lord with their faces to the ground 
also jeshua and bani and sherebiah jamin akkub shabbethai 
hodijah maaseiah kelita azariah jozabad hanan pelaiah and the 
levites caused the people to understand the law and the people stood 
in their place 
so they read in the book in the law of god distinctly and gave 
the sense and caused them to understand the reading 
and nehemiah which is the tirshatha and ezra the priest the 
scribe and the levites that taught the people said unto all the 
people this day is holy unto the lord your god mourn not nor weep 
for all the people wept when they heard the words of the law 
then he said unto them go your way eat the fat and drink the 
sweet and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared for 
this day is holy unto our lord neither be ye sorry for the joy of 
the lord is your strength 
so the levites stilled all the people saying hold your peace 
for the day is holy neither be ye grieved 
and all the people went their way to eat and to drink and to 
send portions and to make great mirth because they had understood 
the words that were declared unto them 
and on the second day were gathered together the chief of the 
fathers of all the people the priests and the levites unto ezra the 
scribe even to understand the words of the law 
and they found written in the law which the lord had commanded by 
moses that the children of israel should dwell in booths in the feast 
of the seventh month and that they should publish and proclaim 
in all their cities and in jerusalem saying go forth unto the 
mount and fetch olive branches and pine branches and myrtle 
branches and palm branches and branches of thick trees to make 
booths as it is written 
so the people went forth and brought them and made themselves 
booths every one upon the roof of his house and in their courts and 
in the courts of the house of god and in the street of the water 
gate and in the street of the gate of ephraim 
and all the congregation of them that were come again out of the 
captivity made booths and sat under the booths for since the days of 
jeshua the son of nun unto that day had not the children of israel 
done so and there was very great gladness 
also day by day from the first day unto the last day he read in 
the book of the law of god and they kept the feast seven days and on 
the eighth day was a solemn assembly according unto the manner 
now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of 
israel were assembled with fasting and with sackclothes and earth 
upon them 
and the seed of israel separated themselves from all strangers 
and stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their 
fathers 
and they stood up in their place and read in the book of the law 
of the lord their god one fourth part of the day and another fourth 
part they confessed and worshipped the lord their god 
then stood up upon the stairs of the levites jeshua and bani 
kadmiel shebaniah bunni sherebiah bani and chenani and cried 
with a loud voice unto the lord their god 
then the levites jeshua and kadmiel bani hashabniah 
sherebiah hodijah shebaniah and pethahiah said stand up and bless 
the lord your god for ever and ever and blessed be thy glorious name 
which is exalted above all blessing and praise 
thou even thou art lord alone thou hast made heaven the heaven 
of heavens with all their host the earth and all things that are 
therein the seas and all that is therein and thou preservest them 
all and the host of heaven worshippeth thee 
thou art the lord the god who didst choose abram and broughtest 
him forth out of you are of the chaldees and gavest him the name of 
abraham and foundest his heart faithful before thee and madest a 
covenant with him to give the land of the canaanites the hittites 
the amorites and the perizzites and the jebusites and the 
girgashites to give it i say to his seed and hast performed thy 
words for thou art righteous and didst see the affliction of our 
fathers in egypt and heardest their cry by the red sea and 
shewedst signs and wonders upon pharaoh and on all his servants and 
on all the people of his land for thou knewest that they dealt 
proudly against them so didst thou get thee a name as it is this 
day 
and thou didst divide the sea before them so that they went 
through the midst of the sea on the dry land and their persecutors 
thou threwest into the deeps as a stone into the mighty waters 
moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar and in 
the night by a pillar of fire to give them light in the way wherein 
they should go 
thou camest down also upon mount sinai and spakest with them 
from heaven and gavest them right judgments and true laws good 
statutes and commandments and madest known unto them thy holy 
sabbath and commandedst them precepts statutes and laws by the 
hand of moses thy servant and gavest them bread from heaven for 
their hunger and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for 
their thirst and promisedst them that they should go in to possess 
the land which thou hadst sworn to give them 
but they and our fathers dealt proudly and hardened their necks 
and hearkened not to thy commandments and refused to obey 
neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them but 
hardened their necks and in their rebellion appointed a captain to 
return to their bondage but thou art a god ready to pardon gracious 
and merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and forsookest 
them not 
yea when they had made them a molten calf and said this is thy 
god that brought thee up out of egypt and had wrought great 
provocations yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them 
not in the wilderness the pillar of the cloud departed not from them 
by day to lead them in the way neither the pillar of fire by night 
to shew them light and the way wherein they should go 
thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them and 
withheldest not thy manna from their mouth and gavest them water for 
their thirst 
yea forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness so 
that they lacked nothing their clothes waxed not old and their feet 
swelled not 
moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations and didst divide 
them into corners so they possessed the land of sihon and the land 
of the king of heshbon and the land of og king of bashan 
their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven and 
broughtest them into the land concerning which thou hadst promised to 
their fathers that they should go in to possess it 
so the children went in and possessed the land and thou 
subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land the canaanites and 
gavest them into their hands with their kings and the people of the 
land that they might do with them as they would 
and they took strong cities and a fat land and possessed houses 
full of all goods wells digged vineyards and oliveyards and fruit 
trees in abundance so they did eat and were filled and became fat 
and delighted themselves in thy great goodness 
nevertheless they were disobedient and rebelled against thee 
and cast thy law behind their backs and slew thy prophets which 
testified against them to turn them to thee and they wrought great 
provocations 
therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies 
who vexed them and in the time of their trouble when they cried unto 
thee thou heardest them from heaven and according to thy manifold 
mercies thou gavest them saviours who saved them out of the hand of 
their enemies 
but after they had rest they did evil again before thee 
therefore leftest thou them in the land of their enemies so that they 
had the dominion over them yet when they returned and cried unto 
thee thou heardest them from heaven and many times didst thou 
deliver them according to thy mercies and testifiedst against 
them that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law yet they dealt 
proudly and hearkened not unto thy commandments but sinned against 
thy judgments which if a man do he shall live in them and 
withdrew the shoulder and hardened their neck and would not hear 
yet many years didst thou forbear them and testifiedst against 
them by thy spirit in thy prophets yet would they not give ear 
therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands 
nevertheless for thy great mercies sake thou didst not utterly 
consume them nor forsake them for thou art a gracious and merciful 
god 
now therefore our god the great the mighty and the terrible 
god who keepest covenant and mercy let not all the trouble seem 
little before thee that hath come upon us on our kings on our 
princes and on our priests and on our prophets and on our fathers 
and on all thy people since the time of the kings of assyria unto 
this day 
howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us for thou 
hast done right but we have done wickedly neither have our 
kings our princes our priests nor our fathers kept thy law nor 
hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies wherewith thou 
didst testify against them 
for they have not served thee in their kingdom and in thy great 
goodness that thou gavest them and in the large and fat land which 
thou gavest before them neither turned they from their wicked works 
behold we are servants this day and for the land that thou 
gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof 
behold we are servants in it and it yieldeth much increase unto 
the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins also they 
have dominion over our bodies and over our cattle at their pleasure 
and we are in great distress 
and because of all this we make a sure covenant and write it 
and our princes levites and priests seal unto it 
now those that sealed were nehemiah the tirshatha the son of 
hachaliah and zidkijah seraiah azariah jeremiah pashur 
amariah malchijah hattush shebaniah malluch harim 
meremoth obadiah daniel ginnethon baruch meshullam

and the rest of the people the priests the levites the 
porters the singers the nethinims and all they that had separated 
themselves from the people of the lands unto the law of god their 
wives their sons and their daughters every one having knowledge 
and having understanding they clave to their brethren their 
nobles and entered into a curse and into an oath to walk in god s 
law which was given by moses the servant of god and to observe and 
do all the commandments of the lord our lord and his judgments and 
his statutes and that we would not give our daughters unto the 
people of the land not take their daughters for our sons and 
if the people of the land bring ware or any victuals on the sabbath 
day to sell that we would not buy it of them on the sabbath or on 
the holy day and that we would leave the seventh year and the 
exaction of every debt 
also we made ordinances for us to charge ourselves yearly with 
the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our god 
for the shewbread and for the continual meat offering and for 
the continual burnt offering of the sabbaths of the new moons for 
the set feasts and for the holy things and for the sin offerings to 
make an atonement for israel and for all the work of the house of our 
god 
and we cast the lots among the priests the levites and the 
people for the wood offering to bring it into the house of our god 
after the houses of our fathers at times appointed year by year to 
burn upon the altar of the lord our god as it is written in the law 
and to bring the firstfruits of our ground and the firstfruits 
of all fruit of all trees year by year unto the house of the lord 
also the firstborn of our sons and of our cattle as it is 
written in the law and the firstlings of our herds and of our flocks 
to bring to the house of our god unto the priests that minister in 
the house of our god and that we should bring the firstfruits 
of our dough and our offerings and the fruit of all manner of trees 
of wine and of oil unto the priests to the chambers of the house of 
our god and the tithes of our ground unto the levites that the same 
levites might have the tithes in all the cities of our tillage 
and the priest the son of aaron shall be with the levites when 
the levites take tithes and the levites shall bring up the tithe of 
the tithes unto the house of our god to the chambers into the 
treasure house 
for the children of israel and the children of levi shall bring 
the offering of the corn of the new wine and the oil unto the 
chambers where are the vessels of the sanctuary and the priests that 
minister and the porters and the singers and we will not forsake 
the house of our god 
and the rulers of the people dwelt at jerusalem the rest of the 
people also cast lots to bring one of ten to dwell in jerusalem the 
holy city and nine parts to dwell in other cities 
and the people blessed all the men that willingly offered 
themselves to dwell at jerusalem

moreover the levites jeshua binnui kadmiel sherebiah judah

in the watches 
and jeshua begat joiakim joiakim also begat eliashib and 
eliashib begat joiada and joiada begat jonathan and jonathan 
begat jaddua 
and in the days of joiakim were priests the chief of the

jaddua were recorded chief of the fathers also the priests to the 
reign of darius the persian 
the sons of levi the chief of the fathers were written in the 
book of the chronicles even until the days of johanan the son of 
eliashib 
and the chief of the levites hashabiah sherebiah and jeshua 
the son of kadmiel with their brethren over against them to praise 
and to give thanks according to the commandment of david the man of 
god ward over against ward 
mattaniah and bakbukiah obadiah meshullam talmon akkub 
were porters keeping the ward at the thresholds of the gates 
these were in the days of joiakim the son of jeshua the son of 
jozadak and in the days of nehemiah the governor and of ezra the 
priest the scribe 
and at the dedication of the wall of jerusalem they sought the 
levites out of all their places to bring them to jerusalem to keep 
the dedication with gladness both with thanksgivings and with 
singing with cymbals psalteries and with harps 
and the sons of the singers gathered themselves together both 
out of the plain country round about jerusalem and from the villages 
of netophathi also from the house of gilgal and out of the 
fields of geba and azmaveth for the singers had builded them villages 
round about jerusalem 
and the priests and the levites purified themselves and 
purified the people and the gates and the wall 
then i brought up the princes of judah upon the wall and 
appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks whereof one 
went on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate and 
after them went hoshaiah and half of the princes of judah and 
azariah ezra and meshullam judah and benjamin and shemaiah 
and jeremiah and certain of the priests sons with trumpets 
namely zechariah the son of jonathan the son of shemaiah the son of 
mattaniah the son of michaiah the son of zaccur the son of asaph 
and his brethren shemaiah and azarael milalai gilalai maai 
nethaneel and judah hanani with the musical instruments of david 
the man of god and ezra the scribe before them 
and at the fountain gate which was over against them they went 
up by the stairs of the city of david at the going up of the wall 
above the house of david even unto the water gate eastward 
and the other company of them that gave thanks went over against 
them and i after them and the half of the people upon the wall from 
beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wall and 
from above the gate of ephraim and above the old gate and above the 
fish gate and the tower of hananeel and the tower of meah even unto 
the sheep gate and they stood still in the prison gate 
so stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house 
of god and i and the half of the rulers with me and the 
priests eliakim maaseiah miniamin michaiah elioenai zechariah 
and hananiah with trumpets and maaseiah and shemaiah and 
eleazar and uzzi and jehohanan and malchijah and elam and ezer 
and the singers sang loud with jezrahiah their overseer 
also that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced for 
god had made them rejoice with great joy the wives also and the 
children rejoiced so that the joy of jerusalem was heard even afar 
off 
and at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the 
treasures for the offerings for the firstfruits and for the tithes 
to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of 
the law for the priests and levites for judah rejoiced for the 
priests and for the levites that waited 
and both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their god 
and the ward of the purification according to the commandment of 
david and of solomon his son 
for in the days of david and asaph of old there were chief of 
the singers and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto god 
and all israel in the days of zerubbabel and in the days of 
nehemiah gave the portions of the singers and the porters every day 
his portion and they sanctified holy things unto the levites and the 
levites sanctified them unto the children of aaron 
on that day they read in the book of moses in the audience of the 
people and therein was found written that the ammonite and the 
moabite should not come into the congregation of god for ever 
because they met not the children of israel with bread and with water 
but hired balaam against them that he should curse them howbeit our 
god turned the curse into a blessing 
now it came to pass when they had heard the law that they 
separated from israel all the mixed multitude 
and before this eliashib the priest having the oversight of the 
chamber of the house of our god was allied unto tobiah and he 
had prepared for him a great chamber where aforetime they laid the 
meat offerings the frankincense and the vessels and the tithes of 
the corn the new wine and the oil which was commanded to be given 
to the levites and the singers and the porters and the offerings of 
the priests 
but in all this time was not i at jerusalem for in the two and 
thirtieth year of artaxerxes king of babylon came i unto the king and 
after certain days obtained i leave of the king and i came to 
jerusalem and understood of the evil that eliashib did for tobiah in 
preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of god 
and it grieved me sore therefore i cast forth all the household 
stuff to tobiah out of the chamber 
then i commanded and they cleansed the chambers and thither 
brought i again the vessels of the house of god with the meat 
offering and the frankincense 
and i perceived that the portions of the levites had not been 
given them for the levites and the singers that did the work were 
fled every one to his field 
then contended i with the rulers and said why is the house of 
god forsaken and i gathered them together and set them in their 
place 
then brought all judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine 
and the oil unto the treasuries 
and i made treasurers over the treasuries shelemiah the priest 
and zadok the scribe and of the levites pedaiah and next to them 
was hanan the son of zaccur the son of mattaniah for they were 
counted faithful and their office was to distribute unto their 
brethren 
remember me o my god concerning this and wipe not out my good 
deeds that i have done for the house of my god and for the offices 
thereof 
in those days saw i in judah some treading wine presses on the 
sabbath and bringing in sheaves and lading asses as also wine 
grapes and figs and all manner of burdens which they brought into 
jerusalem on the sabbath day and i testified against them in the day 
wherein they sold victuals 
there dwelt men of tyre also therein which brought fish and 
all manner of ware and sold on the sabbath unto the children of 
judah and in jerusalem 
then i contended with the nobles of judah and said unto them 
what evil thing is this that ye do and profane the sabbath day 
did not your fathers thus and did not our god bring all this 
evil upon us and upon this city yet ye bring more wrath upon israel 
by profaning the sabbath 
and it came to pass that when the gates of jerusalem began to 
be dark before the sabbath i commanded that the gates should be shut 
and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath and 
some of my servants set i at the gates that there should no burden be 
brought in on the sabbath day 
so the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without 
jerusalem once or twice 
then i testified against them and said unto them why lodge ye 
about the wall if ye do so again i will lay hands on you from that 
time forth came they no more on the sabbath 
and i commanded the levites that they should cleanse themselves 
and that they should come and keep the gates to sanctify the sabbath 
day 
remember me o my god concerning this also and spare me according to 
the greatness of thy mercy 
in those days also saw i jews that had married wives of ashdod 
of ammon and of moab and their children spake half in the 
speech of ashdod and could not speak in the jews language but 
according to the language of each people 
and i contended with them and cursed them and smote certain of 
them and plucked off their hair and made them swear by god saying 
ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons nor take their 
daughters unto your sons or for yourselves 
did not solomon king of israel sin by these things yet among 
many nations was there no king like him who was beloved of his god 
and god made him king over all israel nevertheless even him did 
outlandish women because to sin 
shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil to 
transgress against our god in marrying strange wives and one 
of the sons of joiada the son of eliashib the high priest was son in 
law to sanballat the horonite therefore i chased him from me 
remember them o my god because they have defiled the 
priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and of the levites 
thus cleansed i them from all strangers and appointed the wards 
of the priests and the levites every one in his business and 
for the wood offering at times appointed and for the firstfruits 
remember me o my god for good 
the book of esther 
now it came to pass in the days of ahasuerus this is ahasuerus 
which reigned from india even unto ethiopia over an hundred and 
seven and twenty provinces that in those days when the king 
ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom which was in shushan the 
palace in the third year of his reign he made a feast unto all 
his princes and his servants the power of persia and media the 
nobles and princes of the provinces being before him when he 
shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his 
excellent majesty many days even an hundred and fourscore days 
and when these days were expired the king made a feast unto all 
the people that were present in shushan the palace both unto great 
and small seven days in the court of the garden of the king s 
palace where were white green and blue hangings fastened with 
cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble 
the beds were of gold and silver upon a pavement of red and blue 
and white and black marble 
and they gave them drink in vessels of gold the vessels being 
diverse one from another and royal wine in abundance according to 
the state of the king 
and the drinking was according to the law none did compel for so 
the king had appointed to all the officers of his house that they 
should do according to every man s pleasure 
also vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal 
house which belonged to king ahasuerus 
on the seventh day when the heart of the king was merry with 
wine he commanded mehuman biztha harbona bigtha and abagtha 
zethar and carcas the seven chamberlains that served in the presence 
of ahasuerus the king to bring vashti the queen before the king 
with the crown royal to shew the people and the princes her beauty 
for she was fair to look on 
but the queen vashti refused to come at the king s commandment by 
his chamberlains therefore was the king very wroth and his anger 
burned in him 
then the king said to the wise men which knew the times for so 
was the king s manner toward all that knew law and judgment and 
the next unto him was carshena shethar admatha tarshish meres 
marsena and memucan the seven princes of persia and media which saw 
the king s face and which sat the first in the kingdom what 
shall we do unto the queen vashti according to law because she hath 
not performed the commandment of the king ahasuerus by the 
chamberlains and memucan answered before the king and the 
princes vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only but 
also to all the princes and to all the people that are in all the 
provinces of the king ahasuerus 
for this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women so 
that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes when it shall be 
reported the king ahasuerus commanded vashti the queen to be brought 
in before him but she came not 
likewise shall the ladies of persia and media say this day unto 
all the king s princes which have heard of the deed of the queen 
thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath 
if it please the king let there go a royal commandment from him 
and let it be written among the laws of the persians and the medes 
that it be not altered that vashti come no more before king 
ahasuerus and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is 
better than she 
and when the king s decree which he shall make shall be published 
throughout all his empire for it is great all the wives shall give 
to their husbands honour both to great and small 
and the saying pleased the king and the princes and the king did 
according to the word of memucan for he sent letters into all 
the king s provinces into every province according to the writing 
thereof and to every people after their language that every man 
should bear rule in his own house and that it should be published 
according to the language of every people 
after these things when the wrath of king ahasuerus was appeased 
he remembered vashti and what she had done and what was decreed 
against her 
then said the king s servants that ministered unto him let there 
be fair young virgins sought for the king and let the king 
appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom that they may 
gather together all the fair young virgins unto shushan the palace to 
the house of the women unto the custody of hege the king s 
chamberlain keeper of the women and let their things for 
purification be given them and let the maiden which pleaseth the 
king be queen instead of vashti 
and the thing pleased the king and he did so 
now in shushan the palace there was a certain jew whose name was 
mordecai the son of jair the son of shimei the son of kish a 
benjamite who had been carried away from jerusalem with the 
captivity which had been carried away with jeconiah king of judah 
whom nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon had carried away 
and he brought up hadassah that is esther his uncle s daughter 
for she had neither father nor mother and the maid was fair and 
beautiful whom mordecai when her father and mother were dead took 
for his own daughter 
so it came to pass when the king s commandment and his decree was 
heard and when many maidens were gathered together unto shushan the 
palace to the custody of hegai that esther was brought also unto the 
king s house to the custody of hegai keeper of the women 
and the maiden pleased him and she obtained kindness of him and 
he speedily gave her her things for purification with such things as 
belonged to her and seven maidens which were meet to be given her 
out of the king s house and he preferred her and her maids unto the 
best place of the house of the women 
esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred for mordecai 
had charged her that she should not shew it 
and mordecai walked every day before the court of the women s 
house to know how esther did and what should become of her 
now when every maid s turn was come to go in to king ahasuerus 
after that she had been twelve months according to the manner of the 
women for so were the days of their purifications accomplished to 
wit six months with oil of myrrh and six months with sweet odours 
and with other things for the purifying of the women then thus 
came every maiden unto the king whatsoever she desired was given her 
to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king s house 
in the evening she went and on the morrow she returned into the 
second house of the women to the custody of shaashgaz the king s 
chamberlain which kept the concubines she came in unto the king no 
more except the king delighted in her and that she were called by 
name 
now when the turn of esther the daughter of abihail the uncle of 
mordecai who had taken her for his daughter was come to go in unto 
the king she required nothing but what hegai the king s chamberlain 
the keeper of the women appointed and esther obtained favour in the 
sight of all them that looked upon her 
so esther was taken unto king ahasuerus into his house royal in 
the tenth month which is the month tebeth in the seventh year of his 
reign 
and the king loved esther above all the women and she obtained 
grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins so that he 
set the royal crown upon her head and made her queen instead of 
vashti 
then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his 
servants even esther s feast and he made a release to the provinces 
and gave gifts according to the state of the king 
and when the virgins were gathered together the second time then 
mordecai sat in the king s gate 
esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people as mordecai 
had charged her for esther did the commandment of mordecai like as 
when she was brought up with him 
in those days while mordecai sat in the king s gate two of the 
king s chamberlains bigthan and teresh of those which kept the door 
were wroth and sought to lay hands on the king ahasuerus 
and the thing was known to mordecai who told it unto esther the 
queen and esther certified the king thereof in mordecai s name 
and when inquisition was made of the matter it was found out 
therefore they were both hanged on a tree and it was written in the 
book of the chronicles before the king 
after these things did king ahasuerus promote haman the son of 
hammedatha the agagite and advanced him and set his seat above all 
the princes that were with him 
and all the king s servants that were in the king s gate bowed 
and reverenced haman for the king had so commanded concerning him 
but mordecai bowed not nor did him reverence 
then the king s servants which were in the king s gate said unto 
mordecai why transgressest thou the king s commandment now it 
came to pass when they spake daily unto him and he hearkened not 
unto them that they told haman to see whether mordecai s matters 
would stand for he had told them that he was a jew 
and when haman saw that mordecai bowed not nor did him reverence 
then was haman full of wrath 
and he thought scorn to lay hands on mordecai alone for they had 
shewed him the people of mordecai wherefore haman sought to destroy 
all the jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of ahasuerus even 
the people of mordecai 
in the first month that is the month nisan in the twelfth year 
of king ahasuerus they cast pur that is the lot before haman from 
day to day and from month to month to the twelfth month that is 
the month adar 
and haman said unto king ahasuerus there is a certain people 
scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces 
of thy kingdom and their laws are diverse from all people neither 
keep they the king s laws therefore it is not for the king s profit 
to suffer them 
if it please the king let it be written that they may be 
destroyed and i will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands 
of those that have the charge of the business to bring it into the 
king s treasuries 
and the king took his ring from his hand and gave it unto haman 
the son of hammedatha the agagite the jews enemy 
and the king said unto haman the silver is given to thee the 
people also to do with them as it seemeth good to thee 
then were the king s scribes called on the thirteenth day of the 
first month and there was written according to all that haman had 
commanded unto the king s lieutenants and to the governors that were 
over every province and to the rulers of every people of every 
province according to the writing thereof and to every people after 
their language in the name of king ahasuerus was it written and 
sealed with the king s ring 
and the letters were sent by posts into all the king s provinces 
to destroy to kill and to cause to perish all jews both young and 
old little children and women in one day even upon the thirteenth 
day of the twelfth month which is the month adar and to take the 
spoil of them for a prey 
the copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every 
province was published unto all people that they should be ready 
against that day 
the posts went out being hastened by the king s commandment and 
the decree was given in shushan the palace and the king and haman sat 
down to drink but the city shushan was perplexed 
when mordecai perceived all that was done mordecai rent his 
clothes and put on sackcloth with ashes and went out into the midst 
of the city and cried with a loud and a bitter cry and came even 
before the king s gate for none might enter into the king s gate 
clothed with sackcloth 
and in every province whithersoever the king s commandment and 
his decree came there was great mourning among the jews and fasting 
and weeping and wailing and many lay in sackcloth and ashes 
so esther s maids and her chamberlains came and told it her then 
was the queen exceedingly grieved and she sent raiment to clothe 
mordecai and to take away his sackcloth from him but he received it 
not 
then called esther for hatach one of the king s chamberlains 
whom he had appointed to attend upon her and gave him a commandment 
to mordecai to know what it was and why it was 
so hatach went forth to mordecai unto the street of the city 
which was before the king s gate 
and mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him and of 
the sum of the money that haman had promised to pay to the king s 
treasuries for the jews to destroy them 
also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was 
given at shushan to destroy them to shew it unto esther and to 
declare it unto her and to charge her that she should go in unto the 
king to make supplication unto him and to make request before him 
for her people 
and hatach came and told esther the words of mordecai 
again esther spake unto hatach and gave him commandment unto 
mordecai all the king s servants and the people of the king s 
provinces do know that whosoever whether man or women shall come 
unto the king into the inner court who is not called there is one 
law of his to put him to death except such to whom the king shall 
hold out the golden sceptre that he may live but i have not been 
called to come in unto the king these thirty days 
and they told to mordecai esther s words 
then mordecai commanded to answer esther think not with thyself 
that thou shalt escape in the king s house more than all the jews 
for if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time then shall 
there enlargement and deliverance arise to the jews from another 
place but thou and thy father s house shall be destroyed and who 
knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this 
then esther bade them return mordecai this answer go 
gather together all the jews that are present in shushan and fast ye 
for me and neither eat nor drink three days night or day i also and 
my maidens will fast likewise and so will i go in unto the king 
which is not according to the law and if i perish i perish 
so mordecai went his way and did according to all that esther 
had commanded him 
now it came to pass on the third day that esther put on her royal 
apparel and stood in the inner court of the king s house over 
against the king s house and the king sat upon his royal throne in 
the royal house over against the gate of the house 
and it was so when the king saw esther the queen standing in the 
court that she obtained favour in his sight and the king held out to 
esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand so esther drew near 
and touched the top of the sceptre 
then said the king unto her what wilt thou queen esther and 
what is thy request it shall be even given thee to the half of the 
kingdom 
and esther answered if it seem good unto the king let the king 
and haman come this day unto the banquet that i have prepared for him 
then the king said because haman to make haste that he may do as 
esther hath said so the king and haman came to the banquet that 
esther had prepared 
and the king said unto esther at the banquet of wine what is thy 
petition and it shall be granted thee and what is thy request even 
to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed 
then answered esther and said my petition and my request is 
if i have found favour in the sight of the king and if it please the 
king to grant my petition and to perform my request let the king and 
haman come to the banquet that i shall prepare for them and i will do 
to morrow as the king hath said 
then went haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart but 
when haman saw mordecai in the king s gate that he stood not up nor 
moved for him he was full of indignation against mordecai 
nevertheless haman refrained himself and when he came home he 
sent and called for his friends and zeresh his wife 
and haman told them of the glory of his riches and the multitude 
of his children and all the things wherein the king had promoted him 
and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the 
king 
haman said moreover yea esther the queen did let no man come in 
with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself and 
to morrow am i invited unto her also with the king 
yet all this availeth me nothing so long as i see mordecai the 
jew sitting at the king s gate 
then said zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him let a 
gallows be made of fifty cubits high and to morrow speak thou unto 
the king that mordecai may be hanged thereon then go thou in merrily 
with the king unto the banquet and the thing pleased haman and he 
caused the gallows to be made 
on that night could not the king sleep and he commanded to bring 
the book of records of the chronicles and they were read before the 
king 
and it was found written that mordecai had told of bigthana and 
teresh two of the king s chamberlains the keepers of the door who 
sought to lay hand on the king ahasuerus 
and the king said what honour and dignity hath been done to 
mordecai for this then said the king s servants that ministered unto 
him there is nothing done for him 
and the king said who is in the court now haman was come into 
the outward court of the king s house to speak unto the king to hang 
mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him 
and the king s servants said unto him behold haman standeth in 
the court and the king said let him come in 
so haman came in and the king said unto him what shall be done 
unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour now haman thought in 
his heart to whom would the king delight to do honour more than to 
myself and haman answered the king for the man whom the king 
delighteth to honour let the royal apparel be brought which the 
king useth to wear and the horse that the king rideth upon and the 
crown royal which is set upon his head and let this apparel and 
horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king s most noble 
princes that they may array the man withal whom the king delighteth 
to honour and bring him on horseback through the street of the city 
and proclaim before him thus shall it be done to the man whom the 
king delighteth to honour 
then the king said to haman make haste and take the apparel and 
the horse as thou hast said and do even so to mordecai the jew that 
sitteth at the king s gate let nothing fail of all that thou hast 
spoken 
then took haman the apparel and the horse and arrayed mordecai 
and brought him on horseback through the street of the city and 
proclaimed before him thus shall it be done unto the man whom the 
king delighteth to honour 
and mordecai came again to the king s gate but haman hasted to 
his house mourning and having his head covered 
and haman told zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing 
that had befallen him then said his wise men and zeresh his wife unto 
him if mordecai be of the seed of the jews before whom thou hast 
begun to fall thou shalt not prevail against him but shalt surely 
fall before him 
and while they were yet talking with him came the king s 
chamberlains and hasted to bring haman unto the banquet that esther 
had prepared 
so the king and haman came to banquet with esther the queen 
and the king said again unto esther on the second day at the 
banquet of wine what is thy petition queen esther and it shall be 
granted thee and what is thy request and it shall be performed even 
to the half of the kingdom 
then esther the queen answered and said if i have found favour in 
thy sight o king and if it please the king let my life be given me 
at my petition and my people at my request for we are sold i 
and my people to be destroyed to be slain and to perish but if we 
had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen i had held my tongue 
although the enemy could not countervail the king s damage 
then the king ahasuerus answered and said unto esther the queen 
who is he and where is he that durst presume in his heart to do so 
and esther said the adversary and enemy is this wicked haman 
then haman was afraid before the king and the queen 
and the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went 
into the palace garden and haman stood up to make request for his 
life to esther the queen for he saw that there was evil determined 
against him by the king 
then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of 
the banquet of wine and haman was fallen upon the bed whereon esther 
was then said the king will he force the queen also before me in the 
house as the word went out of king s mouth they covered haman s 
face 
and harbonah one of the chamberlains said before the king 
behold also the gallows fifty cubits high which haman had made for 
mordecai who spoken good for the king standeth in the house of 
haman then the king said hang him thereon 
so they hanged haman on the gallows that he had prepared for 
mordecai then was the king s wrath pacified 
on that day did the king ahasuerus give the house of haman the 
jews enemy unto esther the queen and mordecai came before the king 
for esther had told what he was unto her 
and the king took off his ring which he had taken from haman and 
gave it unto mordecai and esther set mordecai over the house of 
haman 
and esther spake yet again before the king and fell down at his 
feet and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of haman 
the agagite and his device that he had devised against the jews 
then the king held out the golden sceptre toward esther so esther 
arose and stood before the king and said if it please the king 
and if i have favour in his sight and the thing seem right before the 
king and i be pleasing in his eyes let it be written to reverse the 
letters devised by haman the son of hammedatha the agagite which he 
wrote to destroy the jews which are in all the king s provinces 
for how can i endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people 
or how can i endure to see the destruction of my kindred then 
the king ahasuerus said unto esther the queen and to mordecai the jew 
behold i have given esther the house of haman and him they have 
hanged upon the gallows because he laid his hand upon the jews 
write ye also for the jews as it liketh you in the king s name 
and seal it with the king s ring for the writing which is written in 
the king s name and sealed with the king s ring may no man reverse 
then were the king s scribes called at that time in the third 
month that is the month sivan on the three and twentieth day 
thereof and it was written according to all that mordecai commanded 
unto the jews and to the lieutenants and the deputies and rulers of 
the provinces which are from india unto ethiopia an hundred twenty 
and seven provinces unto every province according to the writing 
thereof and unto every people after their language and to the jews 
according to their writing and according to their language 
and he wrote in the king ahasuerus name and sealed it with the 
king s ring and sent letters by posts on horseback and riders on 
mules camels and young dromedaries wherein the king granted 
the jews which were in every city to gather themselves together and 
to stand for their life to destroy to slay and to cause to perish 
all the power of the people and province that would assault them both 
little ones and women and to take the spoil of them for a prey 
upon one day in all the provinces of king ahasuerus namely upon the 
thirteenth day of the twelfth month which is the month adar 
the copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every 
province was published unto all people and that the jews should be 
ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies 
so the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out being 
hastened and pressed on by the king s commandment and the decree was 
given at shushan the palace 
and mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal 
apparel of blue and white and with a great crown of gold and with a 
garment of fine linen and purple and the city of shushan rejoiced and 
was glad 
the jews had light and gladness and joy and honour 
and in every province and in every city whithersoever the 
king s commandment and his decree came the jews had joy and gladness 
a feast and a good day and many of the people of the land became 
jews for the fear of the jews fell upon them 
now in the twelfth month that is the month adar on the 
thirteenth day of the same when the king s commandment and his decree 
drew near to be put in execution in the day that the enemies of the 
jews hoped to have power over them though it was turned to the 
contrary that the jews had rule over them that hated them the 
jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the 
provinces of the king ahasuerus to lay hand on such as sought their 
hurt and no man could withstand them for the fear of them fell upon 
all people 
and all the rulers of the provinces and the lieutenants and the 
deputies and officers of the king helped the jews because the fear 
of mordecai fell upon them 
for mordecai was great in the king s house and his fame went out 
throughout all the provinces for this man mordecai waxed greater and 
greater 
thus the jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the 
sword and slaughter and destruction and did what they would unto 
those that hated them 
and in shushan the palace the jews slew and destroyed five hundred 
men 
and parshandatha and dalphon and aspatha and poratha and 
adalia and aridatha and parmashta and arisai and aridai and 
vajezatha the ten sons of haman the son of hammedatha the enemy 
of the jews slew they but on the spoil laid they not their hand 
on that day the number of those that were slain in shushan the 
palace was brought before the king 
and the king said unto esther the queen the jews have slain and 
destroyed five hundred men in shushan the palace and the ten sons of 
haman what have they done in the rest of the king s provinces now 
what is thy petition and it shall be granted thee or what is thy 
request further and it shall be done 
then said esther if it please the king let it be granted to the 
jews which are in shushan to do to morrow also according unto this 
day s decree and let haman s ten sons be hanged upon the gallows 
and the king commanded it so to be done and the decree was given 
at shushan and they hanged haman s ten sons 
for the jews that were in shushan gathered themselves together on 
the fourteenth day also of the month adar and slew three hundred men 
at shushan but on the prey they laid not their hand 
but the other jews that were in the king s provinces gathered 
themselves together and stood for their lives and had rest from 
their enemies and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand but 
they laid not their hands on the prey on the thirteenth day of 
the month adar and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they and 
made it a day of feasting and gladness 
but the jews that were at shushan assembled together on the 
thirteenth day thereof and on the fourteenth thereof and on the 
fifteenth day of the same they rested and made it a day of feasting 
and gladness 
therefore the jews of the villages that dwelt in the unwalled 
towns made the fourteenth day of the month adar a day of gladness and 
feasting and a good day and of sending portions one to another 
and mordecai wrote these things and sent letters unto all the 
jews that were in all the provinces of the king ahasuerus both nigh 
and far to stablish this among them that they should keep the 
fourteenth day of the month adar and the fifteenth day of the same 
yearly as the days wherein the jews rested from their enemies 
and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy and from 
mourning into a good day that they should make them days of feasting 
and joy and of sending portions one to another and gifts to the 
poor 
and the jews undertook to do as they had begun and as mordecai 
had written unto them because haman the son of hammedatha the 
agagite the enemy of all the jews had devised against the jews to 
destroy them and had cast pur that is the lot to consume them and 
to destroy them but when esther came before the king he 
commanded by letters that his wicked device which he devised against 
the jews should return upon his own head and that he and his sons 
should be hanged on the gallows 
wherefore they called these days purim after the name of pur 
therefore for all the words of this letter and of that which they had 
seen concerning this matter and which had come unto them the 
jews ordained and took upon them and upon their seed and upon all 
such as joined themselves unto them so as it should not fail that 
they would keep these two days according to their writing and 
according to their appointed time every year and that these days 
should be remembered and kept throughout every generation every 
family every province and every city and that these days of purim 
should not fail from among the jews nor the memorial of them perish 
from their seed 
then esther the queen the daughter of abihail and mordecai the 
jew wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of purim 
and he sent the letters unto all the jews to the hundred twenty 
and seven provinces of the kingdom of ahasuerus with words of peace 
and truth to confirm these days of purim in their times 
appointed according as mordecai the jew and esther the queen had 
enjoined them and as they had decreed for themselves and for their 
seed the matters of the fastings and their cry 
and the decree of esther confirmed these matters of purim and it 
was written in the book 
and the king ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land and upon the 
isles of the sea 
and all the acts of his power and of his might and the 
declaration of the greatness of mordecai whereunto the king advanced 
him are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings 
of media and persia for mordecai the jew was next unto king 
ahasuerus and great among the jews and accepted of the multitude of 
his brethren seeking the wealth of his people and speaking peace to 
all his seed 
the book of job 
there was a man in the land of uz whose name was job and that 
man was perfect and upright and one that feared god and eschewed evil 
and there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters 
his substance also was seven thousand sheep and three thousand 
camels and five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred she asses and 
a very great household so that this man was the greatest of all the 
men of the east 
and his sons went and feasted in their houses every one his day 
and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with 
them 
and it was so when the days of their feasting were gone about 
that job sent and sanctified them and rose up early in the morning 
and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all for 
job said it may be that my sons have sinned and cursed god in their 
hearts thus did job continually 
now there was a day when the sons of god came to present 
themselves before the lord and satan came also among them 
and the lord said unto satan whence comest thou then satan 
answered the lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and 
from walking up and down in it 
and the lord said unto satan hast thou considered my servant job 
that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright 
man one that feareth god and escheweth evil then satan 
answered the lord and said doth job fear god for nought hast 
not thou made an hedge about him and about his house and about all 
that he hath on every side thou hast blessed the work of his hands 
and his substance is increased in the land 
but put forth thine hand now and touch all that he hath and he 
will curse thee to thy face 
and the lord said unto satan behold all that he hath is in thy 
power only upon himself put not forth thine hand so satan went forth 
from the presence of the lord 
and there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating 
and drinking wine in their eldest brother s house and there came 
a messenger unto job and said the oxen were plowing and the asses 
feeding beside them and the sabeans fell upon them and took 
them away yea they have slain the servants with the edge of the 
sword and i only am escaped alone to tell thee 
while he was yet speaking there came also another and said the 
fire of god is fallen from heaven and hath burned up the sheep and 
the servants and consumed them and i only am escaped alone to tell 
thee 
while he was yet speaking there came also another and said the 
chaldeans made out three bands and fell upon the camels and have 
carried them away yea and slain the servants with the edge of the 
sword and i only am escaped alone to tell thee 
while he was yet speaking there came also another and said thy 
sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest 
brother s house and behold there came a great wind from the 
wilderness and smote the four corners of the house and it fell upon 
the young men and they are dead and i only am escaped alone to tell 
thee 
then job arose and rent his mantle and shaved his head and 
fell down upon the ground and worshipped and said naked came i 
out of my mother s womb and naked shall i return thither the lord 
gave and the lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the lord 
in all this job sinned not nor charged god foolishly 
again there was a day when the sons of god came to present 
themselves before the lord and satan came also among them to present 
himself before the lord 
and the lord said unto satan from whence comest thou and satan 
answered the lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and 
from walking up and down in it 
and the lord said unto satan hast thou considered my servant job 
that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright 
man one that feareth god and escheweth evil and still he holdeth 
fast his integrity although thou movedst me against him to destroy 
him without because 
and satan answered the lord and said skin for skin yea all 
that a man hath will he give for his life 
but put forth thine hand now and touch his bone and his flesh 
and he will curse thee to thy face 
and the lord said unto satan behold he is in thine hand but 
save his life 
so went satan forth from the presence of the lord and smote job 
with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown 
and he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal and he sat 
down among the ashes 
then said his wife unto him dost thou still retain thine 
integrity curse god and die 
but he said unto her thou speakest as one of the foolish women 
speaketh what shall we receive good at the hand of god and shall we 
not receive evil in all this did not job sin with his lips 
now when job s three friends heard of all this evil that was come 
upon him they came every one from his own place eliphaz the 
temanite and bildad the shuhite and zophar the naamathite for they 
had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to 
comfort him 
and when they lifted up their eyes afar off and knew him not 
they lifted up their voice and wept and they rent every one his 
mantle and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven 
so they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven 
nights and none spake a word unto him for they saw that his grief 
was very great 
after this opened job his mouth and cursed his day 
and job spake and said let the day perish wherein i was 
born and the night in which it was said there is a man child 
conceived 
let that day be darkness let not god regard it from above 
neither let the light shine upon it 
let darkness and the shadow of death stain it let a cloud dwell 
upon it let the blackness of the day terrify it 
as for that night let darkness seize upon it let it not be 
joined unto the days of the year let it not come into the number of 
the months 
lo let that night be solitary let no joyful voice come therein 
let them curse it that curse the day who are ready to raise up 
their mourning 
let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark let it look for 
light but have none neither let it see the dawning of the day 
because it shut not up the doors of my mother s womb nor hid sorrow 
from mine eyes 
why died i not from the womb why did i not give up the ghost 
when i came out of the belly why did the knees prevent me or 
why the breasts that i should suck for now should i have lain 
still and been quiet i should have slept then had i been at rest 
with kings and counsellors of the earth which build desolate 
places for themselves or with princes that had gold who filled 
their houses with silver or as an hidden untimely birth i had 
not been as infants which never saw light 
there the wicked cease from troubling and there the weary be at 
rest 
there the prisoners rest together they hear not the voice of the 
oppressor 
the small and great are there and the servant is free from his 
master 
wherefore is light given to him that is in misery and life unto 
the bitter in soul which long for death but it cometh not and 
dig for it more than for hid treasures which rejoice 
exceedingly and are glad when they can find the grave why is 
light given to a man whose way is hid and whom god hath hedged in 
for my sighing cometh before i eat and my roarings are poured 
out like the waters 
for the thing which i greatly feared is come upon me and that 
which i was afraid of is come unto me 
i was not in safety neither had i rest neither was i quiet yet 
trouble came 
then eliphaz the temanite answered and said if we assay to 
commune with thee wilt thou be grieved but who can withhold himself 
from speaking behold thou hast instructed many and thou hast 
strengthened the weak hands 
thy words have upholden him that was falling and thou hast 
strengthened the feeble knees 
but now it is come upon thee and thou faintest it toucheth thee 
and thou art troubled 
is not this thy fear thy confidence thy hope and the 
uprightness of thy ways remember i pray thee who ever 
perished being innocent or where were the righteous cut off 
even as i have seen they that plow iniquity and sow wickedness reap 
the same 
by the blast of god they perish and by the breath of his nostrils 
are they consumed 
the roaring of the lion and the voice of the fierce lion and 
the teeth of the young lions are broken 
the old lion perisheth for lack of prey and the stout lion s 
whelps are scattered abroad 
now a thing was secretly brought to me and mine ear received a 
little thereof 
in thoughts from the visions of the night when deep sleep 
falleth on men fear came upon me and trembling which made all 
my bones to shake 
then a spirit passed before my face the hair of my flesh stood 
up it stood still but i could not discern the form thereof an 
image was before mine eyes there was silence and i heard a voice 
saying shall mortal man be more just than god shall a man be 
more pure than his maker behold he put no trust in his 
servants and his angels he charged with folly how much less in 
them that dwell in houses of clay whose foundation is in the dust 
which are crushed before the moth they are destroyed from 
morning to evening they perish for ever without any regarding it 
doth not their excellency which is in them go away they die 
even without wisdom 
call now if there be any that will answer thee and to which of 
the saints wilt thou turn for wrath killeth the foolish man and 
envy slayeth the silly one 
i have seen the foolish taking root but suddenly i cursed his 
habitation 
his children are far from safety and they are crushed in the 
gate neither is there any to deliver them 
whose harvest the hungry eateth up and taketh it even out of the 
thorns and the robber swalloweth up their substance 
although affliction cometh not forth of the dust neither doth 
trouble spring out of the ground yet man is born unto trouble as 
the sparks fly upward 
i would seek unto god and unto god would i commit my because 
which doeth great things and unsearchable marvellous things without 
number who giveth rain upon the earth and sendeth waters upon 
the fields to set up on high those that be low that those which 
mourn may be exalted to safety 
he disappointeth the devices of the crafty so that their hands 
cannot perform their enterprise 
he taketh the wise in their own craftiness and the counsel of 
the froward is carried headlong 
they meet with darkness in the day time and grope in the noonday 
as in the night 
but he saveth the poor from the sword from their mouth and from 
the hand of the mighty 
so the poor hath hope and iniquity stoppeth her mouth 
behold happy is the man whom god correcteth therefore despise 
not thou the chastening of the almighty for he maketh sore and 
bindeth up he woundeth and his hands make whole 
he shall deliver thee in six troubles yea in seven there shall 
no evil touch thee 
in famine he shall redeem thee from death and in war from the 
power of the sword 
thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue neither shalt 
thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh 
at destruction and famine thou shalt laugh neither shalt thou be 
afraid of the beasts of the earth 
for thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field and the 
beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee 
and thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace and 
thou shalt visit thy habitation and shalt not sin 
thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great and thine 
offspring as the grass of the earth 
thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age like as a shock of 
corn cometh in in his season 
lo this we have searched it so it is hear it and know thou it 
for thy good 
but job answered and said oh that my grief were throughly 
weighed and my calamity laid in the balances together for now 
it would be heavier than the sand of the sea therefore my words are 
swallowed up 
for the arrows of the almighty are within me the poison whereof 
drinketh up my spirit the terrors of god do set themselves in array 
against me 
doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass or loweth the ox over 
his fodder can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt or 
is there any taste in the white of an egg the things that my 
soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat 
oh that i might have my request and that god would grant me the 
thing that i long for even that it would please god to destroy 
me that he would let loose his hand and cut me off then 
should i yet have comfort yea i would harden myself in sorrow let 
him not spare for i have not concealed the words of the holy one 
what is my strength that i should hope and what is mine end 
that i should prolong my life is my strength the strength of 
stones or is my flesh of brass is not my help in me and is 
wisdom driven quite from me to him that is afflicted pity 
should be shewed from his friend but he forsaketh the fear of the 
almighty 
my brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook and as the stream 
of brooks they pass away which are blackish by reason of the 
ice and wherein the snow is hid what time they wax warm they 
vanish when it is hot they are consumed out of their place 
the paths of their way are turned aside they go to nothing and 
perish 
the troops of tema looked the companies of sheba waited for 
them 
they were confounded because they had hoped they came thither 
and were ashamed 
for now ye are nothing ye see my casting down and are afraid 
did i say bring unto me or give a reward for me of your 
substance or deliver me from the enemy s hand or redeem me 
from the hand of the mighty teach me and i will hold my 
tongue and because me to understand wherein i have erred 
how forcible are right words but what doth your arguing reprove 
do ye imagine to reprove words and the speeches of one that is 
desperate which are as wind yea ye overwhelm the fatherless 
and ye dig a pit for your friend 
now therefore be content look upon me for it is evident unto 
you if i lie 
return i pray you let it not be iniquity yea return again my 
righteousness is in it 
is there iniquity in my tongue cannot my taste discern perverse 
things is there not an appointed time to man upon earth are not 
his days also like the days of an hireling as a servant 
earnestly desireth the shadow and as an hireling looketh for the 
reward of his work so am i made to possess months of vanity and 
wearisome nights are appointed to me 
when i lie down i say when shall i arise and the night be gone 
and i am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day 
my flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust my skin is 
broken and become loathsome 
my days are swifter than a weaver s shuttle and are spent without 
hope 
o remember that my life is wind mine eye shall no more see good 
the eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more thine eyes 
are upon me and i am not 
as the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away so he that goeth down 
to the grave shall come up no more 
he shall return no more to his house neither shall his place 
know him any more 
therefore i will not refrain my mouth i will speak in the 
anguish of my spirit i will complain in the bitterness of my soul 
am i a sea or a whale that thou settest a watch over me 
when i say my bed shall comfort me my couch shall ease my 
complaints then thou scarest me with dreams and terrifiest me 
through visions so that my soul chooseth strangling and death 
rather than my life 
i loathe it i would not live alway let me alone for my days 
are vanity 
what is man that thou shouldest magnify him and that thou 
shouldest set thine heart upon him and that thou shouldest 
visit him every morning and try him every moment how long wilt 
thou not depart from me nor let me alone till i swallow down my 
spittle i have sinned what shall i do unto thee o thou 
preserver of men why hast thou set me as a mark against thee so 
that i am a burden to myself and why dost thou not pardon my 
transgression and take away my iniquity for now shall i sleep in the 
dust and thou shalt seek me in the morning but i shall not be 
then answered bildad the shuhite and said how long wilt thou 
speak these things and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like 
a strong wind doth god pervert judgment or doth the almighty 
pervert justice if thy children have sinned against him and he 
have cast them away for their transgression if thou wouldest seek 
unto god betimes and make thy supplication to the almighty if 
thou wert pure and upright surely now he would awake for thee and 
make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous 
though thy beginning was small yet thy latter end should greatly 
increase 
for enquire i pray thee of the former age and prepare thyself 
to the search of their fathers for we are but of yesterday and 
know nothing because our days upon earth are a shadow shall 
not they teach thee and tell thee and utter words out of their 
heart can the rush grow up without mire can the flag grow 
without water whilst it is yet in his greenness and not cut 
down it withereth before any other herb 
so are the paths of all that forget god and the hypocrite s hope 
shall perish whose hope shall be cut off and whose trust shall 
be a spider s web 
he shall lean upon his house but it shall not stand he shall 
hold it fast but it shall not endure 
he is green before the sun and his branch shooteth forth in his 
garden 
his roots are wrapped about the heap and seeth the place of 
stones 
if he destroy him from his place then it shall deny him saying 
i have not seen thee 
behold this is the joy of his way and out of the earth shall 
others grow 
behold god will not cast away a perfect man neither will he 
help the evil doers till he fill thy mouth with laughing and 
thy lips with rejoicing 
they that hate thee shall be clothed with shame and the dwelling 
place of the wicked shall come to nought 
then job answered and said i know it is so of a truth but 
how should man be just with god if he will contend with him he 
cannot answer him one of a thousand 
he is wise in heart and mighty in strength who hath hardened 
himself against him and hath prospered which removeth the 
mountains and they know not which overturneth them in his anger 
which shaketh the earth out of her place and the pillars thereof 
tremble 
which commandeth the sun and it riseth not and sealeth up the 
stars 
which alone spreadeth out the heavens and treadeth upon the waves 
of the sea 
which maketh arcturus orion and pleiades and the chambers of 
the south 
which doeth great things past finding out yea and wonders 
without number 
lo he goeth by me and i see him not he passeth on also but i 
perceive him not 
behold he taketh away who can hinder him who will say unto 
him what doest thou if god will not withdraw his anger the 
proud helpers do stoop under him 
how much less shall i answer him and choose out my words to 
reason with him whom though i were righteous yet would i not 
answer but i would make supplication to my judge 
if i had called and he had answered me yet would i not believe 
that he had hearkened unto my voice 
for he breaketh me with a tempest and multiplieth my wounds 
without because 
he will not suffer me to take my breath but filleth me with 
bitterness 
if i speak of strength lo he is strong and if of judgment who 
shall set me a time to plead if i justify myself mine own 
mouth shall condemn me if i say i am perfect it shall also prove me 
perverse 
though i were perfect yet would i not know my soul i would 
despise my life 
this is one thing therefore i said it he destroyeth the perfect 
and the wicked 
if the scourge slay suddenly he will laugh at the trial of the 
innocent 
the earth is given into the hand of the wicked he covereth the 
faces of the judges thereof if not where and who is he now 
my days are swifter than a post they flee away they see no good 
they are passed away as the swift ships as the eagle that 
hasteth to the prey 
if i say i will forget my complaint i will leave off my 
heaviness and comfort myself i am afraid of all my sorrows i 
know that thou wilt not hold me innocent 
if i be wicked why then labour i in vain if i wash myself 
with snow water and make my hands never so clean yet shalt thou 
plunge me in the ditch and mine own clothes shall abhor me 
for he is not a man as i am that i should answer him and we 
should come together in judgment 
neither is there any daysman betwixt us that might lay his hand 
upon us both 
let him take his rod away from me and let not his fear terrify 
me then would i speak and not fear him but it is not so with 
me 
my soul is weary of my life i will leave my complaint upon 
myself i will speak in the bitterness of my soul 
i will say unto god do not condemn me shew me wherefore thou 
contendest with me 
is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress that thou 
shouldest despise the work of thine hands and shine upon the counsel 
of the wicked hast thou eyes of flesh or seest thou as man 
seeth are thy days as the days of man are thy years as man s 
days that thou enquirest after mine iniquity and searchest 
after my sin thou knowest that i am not wicked and there is 
none that can deliver out of thine hand 
thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about 
yet thou dost destroy me 
remember i beseech thee that thou hast made me as the clay and 
wilt thou bring me into dust again hast thou not poured me out 
as milk and curdled me like cheese thou hast clothed me with 
skin and flesh and hast fenced me with bones and sinews 
thou hast granted me life and favour and thy visitation hath 
preserved my spirit 
and these things hast thou hid in thine heart i know that this 
is with thee 
if i sin then thou markest me and thou wilt not acquit me from 
mine iniquity 
if i be wicked woe unto me and if i be righteous yet will i 
not lift up my head i am full of confusion therefore see thou mine 
affliction for it increaseth thou huntest me as a fierce lion 
and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me 
thou renewest thy witnesses against me and increasest thine 
indignation upon me changes and war are against me 
wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb oh 
that i had given up the ghost and no eye had seen me i should 
have been as though i had not been i should have been carried from 
the womb to the grave 
are not my days few cease then and let me alone that i may 
take comfort a little before i go whence i shall not return 
even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death a land of 
darkness as darkness itself and of the shadow of death without any 
order and where the light is as darkness 
then answered zophar the naamathite and said should not 
the multitude of words be answered and should a man full of talk be 
justified should thy lies make men hold their peace and when 
thou mockest shall no man make thee ashamed for thou hast 
said my doctrine is pure and i am clean in thine eyes 
but oh that god would speak and open his lips against thee 
and that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom that they are 
double to that which is know therefore that god exacteth of thee less 
than thine iniquity deserveth 
canst thou by searching find out god canst thou find out the 
almighty unto perfection it is as high as heaven what canst 
thou do deeper than hell what canst thou know the measure 
thereof is longer than the earth and broader than the sea 
if he cut off and shut up or gather together then who can 
hinder him for he knoweth vain men he seeth wickedness also 
will he not then consider it for vain men would be wise 
though man be born like a wild ass s colt 
if thou prepare thine heart and stretch out thine hands toward 
him if iniquity be in thine hand put it far away and let not 
wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles 
for then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot yea thou 
shalt be stedfast and shalt not fear because thou shalt forget 
thy misery and remember it as waters that pass away and thine 
age shall be clearer than the noonday thou shalt shine forth thou 
shalt be as the morning 
and thou shalt be secure because there is hope yea thou shalt 
dig about thee and thou shalt take thy rest in safety 
also thou shalt lie down and none shall make thee afraid yea 
many shall make suit unto thee 
but the eyes of the wicked shall fail and they shall not 
escape and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost 
and job answered and said no doubt but ye are the people 
and wisdom shall die with you 
but i have understanding as well as you i am not inferior to 
you yea who knoweth not such things as these i am as one 
mocked of his neighbour who calleth upon god and he answereth him 
the just upright man is laughed to scorn 
he that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in 
the thought of him that is at ease 
the tabernacles of robbers prosper and they that provoke god are 
secure into whose hand god bringeth abundantly 
but ask now the beasts and they shall teach thee and the fowls 
of the air and they shall tell thee or speak to the earth and 
it shall teach thee and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto 
thee 
who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the lord hath 
wrought this in whose hand is the soul of every living thing 
and the breath of all mankind 
doth not the ear try words and the mouth taste his meat 
with the ancient is wisdom and in length of days understanding 
with him is wisdom and strength he hath counsel and 
understanding 
behold he breaketh down and it cannot be built again he 
shutteth up a man and there can be no opening 
behold he withholdeth the waters and they dry up also he 
sendeth them out and they overturn the earth 
with him is strength and wisdom the deceived and the deceiver 
are his 
he leadeth counsellors away spoiled and maketh the judges 
fools 
he looseth the bond of kings and girdeth their loins with a 
girdle 
he leadeth princes away spoiled and overthroweth the mighty 
he removeth away the speech of the trusty and taketh away the 
understanding of the aged 
he poureth contempt upon princes and weakeneth the strength of 
the mighty 
he discovereth deep things out of darkness and bringeth out to 
light the shadow of death 
he increaseth the nations and destroyeth them he enlargeth the 
nations and straiteneth them again 
he taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the 
earth and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no 
way 
they grope in the dark without light and he maketh them to 
stagger like a drunken man 
lo mine eye hath seen all this mine ear hath heard and 
understood it 
what ye know the same do i know also i am not inferior unto 
you 
surely i would speak to the almighty and i desire to reason with 
god 
but ye are forgers of lies ye are all physicians of no value 
o that ye would altogether hold your peace and it should be your 
wisdom 
hear now my reasoning and hearken to the pleadings of my lips 
will ye speak wickedly for god and talk deceitfully for him 
will ye accept his person will ye contend for god is it 
good that he should search you out or as one man mocketh another do 
ye so mock him he will surely reprove you if ye do secretly 
accept persons 
shall not his excellency make you afraid and his dread fall 
upon you your remembrances are like unto ashes your bodies to 
bodies of clay 
hold your peace let me alone that i may speak and let come on 
me what will 
wherefore do i take my flesh in my teeth and put my life in 
mine hand though he slay me yet will i trust in him but i 
will maintain mine own ways before him 
he also shall be my salvation for an hypocrite shall not come 
before him 
hear diligently my speech and my declaration with your ears 
behold now i have ordered my because i know that i shall be 
justified 
who is he that will plead with me for now if i hold my tongue 
i shall give up the ghost 
only do not two things unto me then will i not hide myself from 
thee 
withdraw thine hand far from me and let not thy dread make me 
afraid 
then call thou and i will answer or let me speak and answer 
thou me 
how many are mine iniquities and sins make me to know my 
transgression and my sin 
wherefore hidest thou thy face and holdest me for thine enemy 
wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro and wilt thou pursue 
the dry stubble for thou writest bitter things against me and 
makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth 
thou puttest my feet also in the stocks and lookest narrowly 
unto all my paths thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet 
and he as a rotten thing consumeth as a garment that is moth 
eaten 
man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble 
he cometh forth like a flower and is cut down he fleeth also as 
a shadow and continueth not 
and doth thou open thine eyes upon such an one and bringest me 
into judgment with thee who can bring a clean thing out of an 
unclean not one 
seeing his days are determined the number of his months are with 
thee thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass turn 
from him that he may rest till he shall accomplish as an hireling 
his day 
for there is hope of a tree if it be cut down that it will 
sprout again and that the tender branch thereof will not cease 
though the root thereof wax old in the earth and the stock 
thereof die in the ground yet through the scent of water it will 
bud and bring forth boughs like a plant 
but man dieth and wasteth away yea man giveth up the ghost 
and where is he as the waters fail from the sea and the flood 
decayeth and drieth up so man lieth down and riseth not till 
the heavens be no more they shall not awake nor be raised out of 
their sleep 
o that thou wouldest hide me in the grave that thou wouldest 
keep me secret until thy wrath be past that thou wouldest appoint me 
a set time and remember me if a man die shall he live again 
all the days of my appointed time will i wait till my change come 
thou shalt call and i will answer thee thou wilt have a desire 
to the work of thine hands 
for now thou numberest my steps dost thou not watch over my 
sin my transgression is sealed up in a bag and thou sewest up 
mine iniquity 
and surely the mountains falling cometh to nought and the rock 
is removed out of his place 
the waters wear the stones thou washest away the things which 
grow out of the dust of the earth and thou destroyest the hope of 
man 
thou prevailest for ever against him and he passeth thou 
changest his countenance and sendest him away 
his sons come to honour and he knoweth it not and they are 
brought low but he perceiveth it not of them 
but his flesh upon him shall have pain and his soul within him 
shall mourn 
then answered eliphaz the temanite and said should a wise 
man utter vain knowledge and fill his belly with the east wind 
should he reason with unprofitable talk or with speeches wherewith he 
can do no good yea thou castest off fear and restrainest 
prayer before god 
for thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity and thou choosest the 
tongue of the crafty 
thine own mouth condemneth thee and not i yea thine own lips 
testify against thee 
art thou the first man that was born or wast thou made before 
the hills hast thou heard the secret of god and dost thou 
restrain wisdom to thyself what knowest thou that we know not 
what understandest thou which is not in us with us are both 
the grayheaded and very aged men much elder than thy father 
are the consolations of god small with thee is there any secret 
thing with thee why doth thine heart carry thee away and what 
do thy eyes wink at that thou turnest thy spirit against god 
and lettest such words go out of thy mouth what is man that 
he should be clean and he which is born of a woman that he should be 
righteous behold he putteth no trust in his saints yea the 
heavens are not clean in his sight 
how much more abominable and filthy is man which drinketh 
iniquity like water i will shew thee hear me and that which 
i have seen i will declare which wise men have told from their 
fathers and have not hid it unto whom alone the earth was 
given and no stranger passed among them 
the wicked man travaileth with pain all his days and the number 
of years is hidden to the oppressor 
a dreadful sound is in his ears in prosperity the destroyer 
shall come upon him 
he believeth not that he shall return out of darkness and he is 
waited for of the sword 
he wandereth abroad for bread saying where is it he knoweth 
that the day of darkness is ready at his hand 
trouble and anguish shall make him afraid they shall prevail 
against him as a king ready to the battle 
for he stretcheth out his hand against god and strengtheneth 
himself against the almighty 
he runneth upon him even on his neck upon the thick bosses of 
his bucklers because he covereth his face with his fatness and 
maketh collops of fat on his flanks 
and he dwelleth in desolate cities and in houses which no man 
inhabiteth which are ready to become heaps 
he shall not be rich neither shall his substance continue 
neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth 
he shall not depart out of darkness the flame shall dry up his 
branches and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away 
let not him that is deceived trust in vanity for vanity shall 
be his recompence 
it shall be accomplished before his time and his branch shall 
not be green 
he shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine and shall cast 
off his flower as the olive 
for the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate and fire 
shall consume the tabernacles of bribery 
they conceive mischief and bring forth vanity and their belly 
prepareth deceit 
then job answered and said i have heard many such things 
miserable comforters are ye all 
shall vain words have an end or what emboldeneth thee that thou 
answerest i also could speak as ye do if your soul were in my 
soul s stead i could heap up words against you and shake mine head 
at you 
but i would strengthen you with my mouth and the moving of my 
lips should asswage your grief 
though i speak my grief is not asswaged and though i forbear 
what am i eased but now he hath made me weary thou hast made 
desolate all my company 
and thou hast filled me with wrinkles which is a witness against 
me and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face 
he teareth me in his wrath who hateth me he gnasheth upon me 
with his teeth mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me 
they have gaped upon me with their mouth they have smitten me 
upon the cheek reproachfully they have gathered themselves together 
against me 
god hath delivered me to the ungodly and turned me over into 
the hands of the wicked 
i was at ease but he hath broken me asunder he hath also taken 
me by my neck and shaken me to pieces and set me up for his mark 
his archers compass me round about he cleaveth my reins 
asunder and doth not spare he poureth out my gall upon the ground 
he breaketh me with breach upon breach he runneth upon me like 
a giant 
i have sewed sackcloth upon my skin and defiled my horn in the 
dust 
my face is foul with weeping and on my eyelids is the shadow of 
death not for any injustice in mine hands also my prayer is 
pure 
o earth cover not thou my blood and let my cry have no place 
also now behold my witness is in heaven and my record is on 
high 
my friends scorn me but mine eye poureth out tears unto god 
o that one might plead for a man with god as a man pleadeth for 
his neighbour when a few years are come then i shall go the 
way whence i shall not return 
my breath is corrupt my days are extinct the graves are ready 
for me 
are there not mockers with me and doth not mine eye continue in 
their provocation lay down now put me in a surety with thee 
who is he that will strike hands with me for thou hast hid 
their heart from understanding therefore shalt thou not exalt them 
he that speaketh flattery to his friends even the eyes of his 
children shall fail 
he hath made me also a byword of the people and aforetime i was 
as a tabret 
mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow and all my members are 
as a shadow 
upright men shall be astonied at this and the innocent shall 
stir up himself against the hypocrite 
the righteous also shall hold on his way and he that hath clean 
hands shall be stronger and stronger 
but as for you all do ye return and come now for i cannot 
find one wise man among you 
my days are past my purposes are broken off even the thoughts 
of my heart 
they change the night into day the light is short because of 
darkness 
if i wait the grave is mine house i have made my bed in the 
darkness 
i have said to corruption thou art my father to the worm thou 
art my mother and my sister 
and where is now my hope as for my hope who shall see it 
they shall go down to the bars of the pit when our rest 
together is in the dust 
then answered bildad the shuhite and said how long will it 
be ere ye make an end of words mark and afterwards we will speak 
wherefore are we counted as beasts and reputed vile in your 
sight he teareth himself in his anger shall the earth be 
forsaken for thee and shall the rock be removed out of his place 
yea the light of the wicked shall be put out and the spark of 
his fire shall not shine 
the light shall be dark in his tabernacle and his candle shall 
be put out with him 
the steps of his strength shall be straitened and his own 
counsel shall cast him down 
for he is cast into a net by his own feet and he walketh upon a 
snare 
the gin shall take him by the heel and the robber shall prevail 
against him 
the snare is laid for him in the ground and a trap for him in 
the way 
terrors shall make him afraid on every side and shall drive him 
to his feet 
his strength shall be hungerbitten and destruction shall be 
ready at his side 
it shall devour the strength of his skin even the firstborn of 
death shall devour his strength 
his confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle and it 
shall bring him to the king of terrors 
it shall dwell in his tabernacle because it is none of his 
brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation 
his roots shall be dried up beneath and above shall his branch 
be cut off 
his remembrance shall perish from the earth and he shall have 
no name in the street 
he shall be driven from light into darkness and chased out of 
the world 
he shall neither have son nor nephew among his people nor any 
remaining in his dwellings 
they that come after him shall be astonied at his day as they 
that went before were affrighted 
surely such are the dwellings of the wicked and this is the 
place of him that knoweth not god 
then job answered and said how long will ye vex my soul 
and break me in pieces with words these ten times have ye 
reproached me ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to 
me 
and be it indeed that i have erred mine error remaineth with 
myself 
if indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me and plead 
against me my reproach know now that god hath overthrown me and 
hath compassed me with his net 
behold i cry out of wrong but i am not heard i cry aloud but 
there is no judgment 
he hath fenced up my way that i cannot pass and he hath set 
darkness in my paths 
he hath stripped me of my glory and taken the crown from my 
head 
he hath destroyed me on every side and i am gone and mine hope 
hath he removed like a tree 
he hath also kindled his wrath against me and he counteth me 
unto him as one of his enemies 
his troops come together and raise up their way against me and 
encamp round about my tabernacle 
he hath put my brethren far from me and mine acquaintance are 
verily estranged from me 
my kinsfolk have failed and my familiar friends have forgotten 
me 
they that dwell in mine house and my maids count me for a 
stranger i am an alien in their sight 
i called my servant and he gave me no answer i intreated him 
with my mouth 
my breath is strange to my wife though i intreated for the 
children s sake of mine own body 
yea young children despised me i arose and they spake against 
me 
all my inward friends abhorred me and they whom i loved are 
turned against me 
my bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh and i am escaped 
with the skin of my teeth 
have pity upon me have pity upon me o ye my friends for the 
hand of god hath touched me 
why do ye persecute me as god and are not satisfied with my 
flesh oh that my words were now written oh that they were 
printed in a book that they were graven with an iron pen and 
lead in the rock for ever for i know that my redeemer liveth 
and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth and 
though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall i 
see god whom i shall see for myself and mine eyes shall 
behold and not another though my reins be consumed within me 
but ye should say why persecute we him seeing the root of the 
matter is found in me be ye afraid of the sword for wrath 
bringeth the punishments of the sword that ye may know there is a 
judgment 
then answered zophar the naamathite and said therefore do 
my thoughts because me to answer and for this i make haste 
i have heard the check of my reproach and the spirit of my 
understanding causeth me to answer 
knowest thou not this of old since man was placed upon earth 
that the triumphing of the wicked is short and the joy of the 
hypocrite but for a moment though his excellency mount up to 
the heavens and his head reach unto the clouds yet he shall 
perish for ever like his own dung they which have seen him shall say 
where is he he shall fly away as a dream and shall not be 
found yea he shall be chased away as a vision of the night 
the eye also which saw him shall see him no more neither shall 
his place any more behold him 
his children shall seek to please the poor and his hands shall 
restore their goods 
his bones are full of the sin of his youth which shall lie down 
with him in the dust 
though wickedness be sweet in his mouth though he hide it under 
his tongue though he spare it and forsake it not but keep it 
still within his mouth yet his meat in his bowels is turned it 
is the gall of asps within him 
he hath swallowed down riches and he shall vomit them up again 
god shall cast them out of his belly 
he shall suck the poison of asps the viper s tongue shall slay 
him 
he shall not see the rivers the floods the brooks of honey and 
butter 
that which he laboured for shall he restore and shall not 
swallow it down according to his substance shall the restitution be 
and he shall not rejoice therein 
because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor because he 
hath violently taken away an house which he builded not surely 
he shall not feel quietness in his belly he shall not save of that 
which he desired 
there shall none of his meat be left therefore shall no man 
look for his goods 
in the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits every 
hand of the wicked shall come upon him 
when he is about to fill his belly god shall cast the fury of 
his wrath upon him and shall rain it upon him while he is eating 
he shall flee from the iron weapon and the bow of steel shall 
strike him through 
it is drawn and cometh out of the body yea the glittering 
sword cometh out of his gall terrors are upon him 
all darkness shall be hid in his secret places a fire not blown 
shall consume him it shall go ill with him that is left in his 
tabernacle 
the heaven shall reveal his iniquity and the earth shall rise 
up against him 
the increase of his house shall depart and his goods shall flow 
away in the day of his wrath 
this is the portion of a wicked man from god and the heritage 
appointed unto him by god 
but job answered and said hear diligently my speech and 
let this be your consolations 
suffer me that i may speak and after that i have spoken mock 
on 
as for me is my complaint to man and if it were so why should 
not my spirit be troubled mark me and be astonished and lay 
your hand upon your mouth 
even when i remember i am afraid and trembling taketh hold on my 
flesh 
wherefore do the wicked live become old yea are mighty in 
power their seed is established in their sight with them and 
their offspring before their eyes 
their houses are safe from fear neither is the rod of god upon 
them 
their bull gendereth and faileth not their cow calveth and 
casteth not her calf 
they send forth their little ones like a flock and their 
children dance 
they take the timbrel and harp and rejoice at the sound of the 
organ 
they spend their days in wealth and in a moment go down to the 
grave 
therefore they say unto god depart from us for we desire not 
the knowledge of thy ways 
what is the almighty that we should serve him and what profit 
should we have if we pray unto him lo their good is not in 
their hand the counsel of the wicked is far from me 
how oft is the candle of the wicked put out and how oft cometh 
their destruction upon them god distributeth sorrows in his anger 
they are as stubble before the wind and as chaff that the storm 
carrieth away 
god layeth up his iniquity for his children he rewardeth him 
and he shall know it 
his eyes shall see his destruction and he shall drink of the 
wrath of the almighty 
for what pleasure hath he in his house after him when the 
number of his months is cut off in the midst shall any teach 
god knowledge seeing he judgeth those that are high 
one dieth in his full strength being wholly at ease and quiet 
his breasts are full of milk and his bones are moistened with 
marrow 
and another dieth in the bitterness of his soul and never 
eateth with pleasure 
they shall lie down alike in the dust and the worms shall cover 
them 
behold i know your thoughts and the devices which ye 
wrongfully imagine against me 
for ye say where is the house of the prince and where are the 
dwelling places of the wicked have ye not asked them that go 
by the way and do ye not know their tokens that the wicked is 
reserved to the day of destruction they shall be brought forth to the 
day of wrath 
who shall declare his way to his face and who shall repay him 
what he hath done yet shall he be brought to the grave and 
shall remain in the tomb 
the clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him and every man 
shall draw after him as there are innumerable before him 
how then comfort ye me in vain seeing in your answers there 
remaineth falsehood then eliphaz the temanite answered and 
said can a man be profitable unto god as he that is wise may be 
profitable unto himself is it any pleasure to the almighty 
that thou art righteous or is it gain to him that thou makest thy 
ways perfect will he reprove thee for fear of thee will he 
enter with thee into judgment is not thy wickedness great and 
thine iniquities infinite for thou hast taken a pledge from thy 
brother for nought and stripped the naked of their clothing 
thou hast not given water to the weary to drink and thou hast 
withholden bread from the hungry 
but as for the mighty man he had the earth and the honourable 
man dwelt in it 
thou hast sent widows away empty and the arms of the fatherless 
have been broken 
therefore snares are round about thee and sudden fear troubleth 
thee or darkness that thou canst not see and abundance of 
waters cover thee 
is not god in the height of heaven and behold the height of the 
stars how high they are and thou sayest how doth god know 
can he judge through the dark cloud thick clouds are a 
covering to him that he seeth not and he walketh in the circuit of 
heaven 
hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden 
which were cut down out of time whose foundation was overflown 
with a flood which said unto god depart from us and what can 
the almighty do for them yet he filled their houses with good 
things but the counsel of the wicked is far from me 
the righteous see it and are glad and the innocent laugh them 
to scorn 
whereas our substance is not cut down but the remnant of them 
the fire consumeth 
acquaint now thyself with him and be at peace thereby good 
shall come unto thee 
receive i pray thee the law from his mouth and lay up his 
words in thine heart 
if thou return to the almighty thou shalt be built up thou 
shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles 
then shalt thou lay up gold as dust and the gold of ophir as 
the stones of the brooks 
yea the almighty shall be thy defence and thou shalt have 
plenty of silver 
for then shalt thou have thy delight in the almighty and shalt 
lift up thy face unto god 
thou shalt make thy prayer unto him and he shall hear thee and 
thou shalt pay thy vows 
thou shalt also decree a thing and it shall be established unto 
thee and the light shall shine upon thy ways 
when men are cast down then thou shalt say there is lifting 
up and he shall save the humble person 
he shall deliver the island of the innocent and it is delivered 
by the pureness of thine hands 
then job answered and said even to day is my complaint 
bitter my stroke is heavier than my groaning 
oh that i knew where i might find him that i might come even to 
his seat i would order my because before him and fill my mouth 
with arguments 
i would know the words which he would answer me and understand 
what he would say unto me 
will he plead against me with his great power no but he would 
put strength in me 
there the righteous might dispute with him so should i be 
delivered for ever from my judge 
behold i go forward but he is not there and backward but i 
cannot perceive him on the left hand where he doth work but i 
cannot behold him he hideth himself on the right hand that i cannot 
see him but he knoweth the way that i take when he hath tried 
me i shall come forth as gold 
my foot hath held his steps his way have i kept and not 
declined 
neither have i gone back from the commandment of his lips i 
have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food 
but he is in one mind and who can turn him and what his soul 
desireth even that he doeth 
for he performeth the thing that is appointed for me and many 
such things are with him 
therefore am i troubled at his presence when i consider i am 
afraid of him 
for god maketh my heart soft and the almighty troubleth me 
because i was not cut off before the darkness neither hath he 
covered the darkness from my face 
why seeing times are not hidden from the almighty do they that 
know him not see his days some remove the landmarks they 
violently take away flocks and feed thereof 
they drive away the ass of the fatherless they take the widow s 
ox for a pledge 
they turn the needy out of the way the poor of the earth hide 
themselves together 
behold as wild asses in the desert go they forth to their work 
rising betimes for a prey the wilderness yieldeth food for them and 
for their children 
they reap every one his corn in the field and they gather the 
vintage of the wicked 
they because the naked to lodge without clothing that they have no 
covering in the cold 
they are wet with the showers of the mountains and embrace the 
rock for want of a shelter 
they pluck the fatherless from the breast and take a pledge of 
the poor 
they because him to go naked without clothing and they take away 
the sheaf from the hungry which make oil within their walls 
and tread their winepresses and suffer thirst 
men groan from out of the city and the soul of the wounded 
crieth out yet god layeth not folly to them 
they are of those that rebel against the light they know not 
the ways thereof nor abide in the paths thereof 
the murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy 
and in the night is as a thief 
the eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight saying 
no eye shall see me and disguiseth his face 
in the dark they dig through houses which they had marked for 
themselves in the daytime they know not the light 
for the morning is to them even as the shadow of death if one 
know them they are in the terrors of the shadow of death 
he is swift as the waters their portion is cursed in the earth 
he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards 
drought and heat consume the snow waters so doth the grave 
those which have sinned 
the womb shall forget him the worm shall feed sweetly on him 
he shall be no more remembered and wickedness shall be broken as a 
tree 
he evil entreateth the barren that beareth not and doeth not 
good to the widow 
he draweth also the mighty with his power he riseth up and no 
man is sure of life 
though it be given him to be in safety whereon he resteth yet 
his eyes are upon their ways 
they are exalted for a little while but are gone and brought 
low they are taken out of the way as all other and cut off as the 
tops of the ears of corn 
and if it be not so now who will make me a liar and make my 
speech nothing worth then answered bildad the shuhite and 
said dominion and fear are with him he maketh peace in his high 
places 
is there any number of his armies and upon whom doth not his 
light arise how then can man be justified with god or how can 
he be clean that is born of a woman behold even to the moon 
and it shineth not yea the stars are not pure in his sight 
how much less man that is a worm and the son of man which is a 
worm but job answered and said how hast thou helped him 
that is without power how savest thou the arm that hath no strength 
how hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom and how hast 
thou plentifully declared the thing as it is to whom hast thou 
uttered words and whose spirit came from thee dead things are 
formed from under the waters and the inhabitants thereof 
hell is naked before him and destruction hath no covering 
he stretcheth out the north over the empty place and hangeth the 
earth upon nothing 
he bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds and the cloud is 
not rent under them 
he holdeth back the face of his throne and spreadeth his cloud 
upon it 
he hath compassed the waters with bounds until the day and 
night come to an end 
the pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof 
he divideth the sea with his power and by his understanding he 
smiteth through the proud 
by his spirit he hath garnished the heavens his hand hath 
formed the crooked serpent 
lo these are parts of his ways but how little a portion is 
heard of him but the thunder of his power who can understand 
moreover job continued his parable and said as god liveth who 
hath taken away my judgment and the almighty who hath vexed my soul 
all the while my breath is in me and the spirit of god is in my 
nostrils my lips shall not speak wickedness nor my tongue utter 
deceit 
god forbid that i should justify you till i die i will not 
remove mine integrity from me 
my righteousness i hold fast and will not let it go my heart 
shall not reproach me so long as i live 
let mine enemy be as the wicked and he that riseth up against me 
as the unrighteous 
for what is the hope of the hypocrite though he hath gained 
when god taketh away his soul will god hear his cry when 
trouble cometh upon him will he delight himself in the 
almighty will he always call upon god i will teach you by the 
hand of god that which is with the almighty will i not conceal 
behold all ye yourselves have seen it why then are ye thus 
altogether vain this is the portion of a wicked man with god 
and the heritage of oppressors which they shall receive of the 
almighty 
if his children be multiplied it is for the sword and his 
offspring shall not be satisfied with bread 
those that remain of him shall be buried in death and his 
widows shall not weep 
though he heap up silver as the dust and prepare raiment as the 
clay he may prepare it but the just shall put it on and the 
innocent shall divide the silver 
he buildeth his house as a moth and as a booth that the keeper 
maketh 
the rich man shall lie down but he shall not be gathered he 
openeth his eyes and he is not 
terrors take hold on him as waters a tempest stealeth him away 
in the night 
the east wind carrieth him away and he departeth and as a 
storm hurleth him out of his place 
for god shall cast upon him and not spare he would fain flee 
out of his hand 
men shall clap their hands at him and shall hiss him out of his 
place 
surely there is a vein for the silver and a place for gold where 
they fine it 
iron is taken out of the earth and brass is molten out of the 
stone 
he setteth an end to darkness and searcheth out all perfection 
the stones of darkness and the shadow of death 
the flood breaketh out from the inhabitant even the waters 
forgotten of the foot they are dried up they are gone away from men 
as for the earth out of it cometh bread and under it is turned 
up as it were fire 
the stones of it are the place of sapphires and it hath dust of 
gold 
there is a path which no fowl knoweth and which the vulture s 
eye hath not seen the lion s whelps have not trodden it nor the 
fierce lion passed by it 
he putteth forth his hand upon the rock he overturneth the 
mountains by the roots 
he cutteth out rivers among the rocks and his eye seeth every 
precious thing 
he bindeth the floods from overflowing and the thing that is 
hid bringeth he forth to light 
but where shall wisdom be found and where is the place of 
understanding man knoweth not the price thereof neither is it 
found in the land of the living 
the depth saith it is not in me and the sea saith it is not 
with me 
it cannot be gotten for gold neither shall silver be weighed 
for the price thereof 
it cannot be valued with the gold of ophir with the precious 
onyx or the sapphire 
the gold and the crystal cannot equal it and the exchange of it 
shall not be for jewels of fine gold 
no mention shall be made of coral or of pearls for the price 
of wisdom is above rubies 
the topaz of ethiopia shall not equal it neither shall it be 
valued with pure gold 
whence then cometh wisdom and where is the place of 
understanding seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living 
and kept close from the fowls of the air 
destruction and death say we have heard the fame thereof with 
our ears 
god understandeth the way thereof and he knoweth the place 
thereof 
for he looketh to the ends of the earth and seeth under the 
whole heaven to make the weight for the winds and he weigheth 
the waters by measure 
when he made a decree for the rain and a way for the lightning 
of the thunder then did he see it and declare it he prepared 
it yea and searched it out 
and unto man he said behold the fear of the lord that is 
wisdom and to depart from evil is understanding 
moreover job continued his parable and said oh that i were 
as in months past as in the days when god preserved me when his 
candle shined upon my head and when by his light i walked through 
darkness as i was in the days of my youth when the secret of 
god was upon my tabernacle when the almighty was yet with me 
when my children were about me when i washed my steps with 
butter and the rock poured me out rivers of oil when i went out 
to the gate through the city when i prepared my seat in the street 
the young men saw me and hid themselves and the aged arose and 
stood up 
the princes refrained talking and laid their hand on their 
mouth 
the nobles held their peace and their tongue cleaved to the 
roof of their mouth 
when the ear heard me then it blessed me and when the eye saw 
me it gave witness to me because i delivered the poor that 
cried and the fatherless and him that had none to help him 
the blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me and i 
caused the widow s heart to sing for joy 
i put on righteousness and it clothed me my judgment was as a 
robe and a diadem 
i was eyes to the blind and feet was i to the lame 
i was a father to the poor and the because which i knew not i 
searched out 
and i brake the jaws of the wicked and plucked the spoil out of 
his teeth 
then i said i shall die in my nest and i shall multiply my 
days as the sand 
my root was spread out by the waters and the dew lay all night 
upon my branch 
my glory was fresh in me and my bow was renewed in my hand 
unto me men gave ear and waited and kept silence at my 
counsel 
after my words they spake not again and my speech dropped upon 
them 
and they waited for me as for the rain and they opened their 
mouth wide as for the latter rain 
if i laughed on them they believed it not and the light of my 
countenance they cast not down 
i chose out their way and sat chief and dwelt as a king in the 
army as one that comforteth the mourners 
but now they that are younger than i have me in derision whose 
fathers i would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock 
yea whereto might the strength of their hands profit me in whom 
old age was perished for want and famine they were solitary 
fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste 
who cut up mallows by the bushes and juniper roots for their 
meat 
they were driven forth from among men they cried after them as 
after a thief to dwell in the cliffs of the valleys in caves 
of the earth and in the rocks 
among the bushes they brayed under the nettles they were 
gathered together 
they were children of fools yea children of base men they were 
viler than the earth 
and now am i their song yea i am their byword 
they abhor me they flee far from me and spare not to spit in 
my face 
because he hath loosed my cord and afflicted me they have also 
let loose the bridle before me 
upon my right hand rise the youth they push away my feet and 
they raise up against me the ways of their destruction 
they mar my path they set forward my calamity they have no 
helper 
they came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters in the 
desolation they rolled themselves upon me 
terrors are turned upon me they pursue my soul as the wind and 
my welfare passeth away as a cloud 
and now my soul is poured out upon me the days of affliction 
have taken hold upon me 
my bones are pierced in me in the night season and my sinews 
take no rest 
by the great force of my disease is my garment changed it 
bindeth me about as the collar of my coat 
he hath cast me into the mire and i am become like dust and 
ashes 
i cry unto thee and thou dost not hear me i stand up and thou 
regardest me not 
thou art become cruel to me with thy strong hand thou opposest 
thyself against me 
thou liftest me up to the wind thou causest me to ride upon it 
and dissolvest my substance 
for i know that thou wilt bring me to death and to the house 
appointed for all living 
howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave though 
they cry in his destruction 
did not i weep for him that was in trouble was not my soul 
grieved for the poor when i looked for good then evil came 
unto me and when i waited for light there came darkness 
my bowels boiled and rested not the days of affliction 
prevented me 
i went mourning without the sun i stood up and i cried in the 
congregation 
i am a brother to dragons and a companion to owls 
my skin is black upon me and my bones are burned with heat 
my harp also is turned to mourning and my organ into the voice 
of them that weep 
i made a covenant with mine eyes why then should i think upon a 
maid for what portion of god is there from above and what 
inheritance of the almighty from on high is not destruction to 
the wicked and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity 
doth not he see my ways and count all my steps if i have 
walked with vanity or if my foot hath hasted to deceit let me 
be weighed in an even balance that god may know mine integrity 
if my step hath turned out of the way and mine heart walked 
after mine eyes and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands then 
let me sow and let another eat yea let my offspring be rooted out 
if mine heart have been deceived by a woman or if i have laid 
wait at my neighbour s door then let my wife grind unto 
another and let others bow down upon her 
for this is an heinous crime yea it is an iniquity to be 
punished by the judges 
for it is a fire that consumeth to destruction and would root 
out all mine increase 
if i did despise the because of my manservant or of my 
maidservant when they contended with me what then shall i do 
when god riseth up and when he visiteth what shall i answer him 
did not he that made me in the womb make him and did not one 
fashion us in the womb if i have withheld the poor from their 
desire or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail or have 
eaten my morsel myself alone and the fatherless hath not eaten 
thereof for from my youth he was brought up with me as with a 
father and i have guided her from my mother s womb if i have 
seen any perish for want of clothing or any poor without covering 
if his loins have not blessed me and if he were not warmed with 
the fleece of my sheep if i have lifted up my hand against the 
fatherless when i saw my help in the gate then let mine arm 
fall from my shoulder blade and mine arm be broken from the bone 
for destruction from god was a terror to me and by reason of 
his highness i could not endure 
if i have made gold my hope or have said to the fine gold thou 
art my confidence if i rejoice because my wealth was great and 
because mine hand had gotten much if i beheld the sun when it 
shined or the moon walking in brightness and my heart hath 
been secretly enticed or my mouth hath kissed my hand this 
also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge for i should have 
denied the god that is above 
if i rejoice at the destruction of him that hated me or lifted 
up myself when evil found him neither have i suffered my mouth 
to sin by wishing a curse to his soul 
if the men of my tabernacle said not oh that we had of his 
flesh we cannot be satisfied 
the stranger did not lodge in the street but i opened my doors 
to the traveller 
if i covered my transgressions as adam by hiding mine iniquity 
in my bosom did i fear a great multitude or did the contempt 
of families terrify me that i kept silence and went not out of the 
door oh that one would hear me behold my desire is that the 
almighty would answer me and that mine adversary had written a book 
surely i would take it upon my shoulder and bind it as a crown 
to me 
i would declare unto him the number of my steps as a prince 
would i go near unto him 
if my land cry against me or that the furrows likewise thereof 
complain if i have eaten the fruits thereof without money or 
have caused the owners thereof to lose their life let thistles 
grow instead of wheat and cockle instead of barley 
the words of job are ended 
so these three men ceased to answer job because he was righteous 
in his own eyes 
then was kindled the wrath of elihu the son of barachel the 
buzite of the kindred of ram against job was his wrath kindled 
because he justified himself rather than god 
also against his three friends was his wrath kindled because 
they had found no answer and yet had condemned job 
now elihu had waited till job had spoken because they were elder 
than he 
when elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these 
three men then his wrath was kindled 
and elihu the son of barachel the buzite answered and said i am 
young and ye are very old wherefore i was afraid and durst not shew 
you mine opinion 
i said days should speak and multitude of years should teach 
wisdom 
but there is a spirit in man and the inspiration of the almighty 
giveth them understanding 
great men are not always wise neither do the aged understand 
judgment 
therefore i said hearken to me i also will shew mine opinion 
behold i waited for your words i gave ear to your reasons 
whilst ye searched out what to say 
yea i attended unto you and behold there was none of you 
that convinced job or that answered his words lest ye should 
say we have found out wisdom god thrusteth him down not man 
now he hath not directed his words against me neither will i 
answer him with your speeches 
they were amazed they answered no more they left off speaking 
when i had waited for they spake not but stood still and 
answered no more i said i will answer also my part i also 
will shew mine opinion 
for i am full of matter the spirit within me constraineth me 
behold my belly is as wine which hath no vent it is ready to 
burst like new bottles 
i will speak that i may be refreshed i will open my lips and 
answer 
let me not i pray you accept any man s person neither let me 
give flattering titles unto man 
for i know not to give flattering titles in so doing my maker 
would soon take me away 
wherefore job i pray thee hear my speeches and hearken to all 
my words 
behold now i have opened my mouth my tongue hath spoken in my 
mouth 
my words shall be of the uprightness of my heart and my lips 
shall utter knowledge clearly 
the spirit of god hath made me and the breath of the almighty 
hath given me life 
if thou canst answer me set thy words in order before me stand 
up 
behold i am according to thy wish in god s stead i also am 
formed out of the clay 
behold my terror shall not make thee afraid neither shall my 
hand be heavy upon thee 
surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing and i have heard the 
voice of thy words saying i am clean without transgression i 
am innocent neither is there iniquity in me 
behold he findeth occasions against me he counteth me for his 
enemy he putteth my feet in the stocks he marketh all my 
paths 
behold in this thou art not just i will answer thee that god 
is greater than man 
why dost thou strive against him for he giveth not account of 
any of his matters 
for god speaketh once yea twice yet man perceiveth it not 
in a dream in a vision of the night when deep sleep falleth 
upon men in slumberings upon the bed then he openeth the ears 
of men and sealeth their instruction that he may withdraw man 
from his purpose and hide pride from man 
he keepeth back his soul from the pit and his life from 
perishing by the sword 
he is chastened also with pain upon his bed and the multitude 
of his bones with strong pain so that his life abhorreth bread 
and his soul dainty meat 
his flesh is consumed away that it cannot be seen and his 
bones that were not seen stick out 
yea his soul draweth near unto the grave and his life to the 
destroyers 
if there be a messenger with him an interpreter one among a 
thousand to shew unto man his uprightness then he is gracious 
unto him and saith deliver him from going down to the pit i have 
found a ransom 
his flesh shall be fresher than a child s he shall return to 
the days of his youth he shall pray unto god and he will be 
favourable unto him and he shall see his face with joy for he will 
render unto man his righteousness 
he looketh upon men and if any say i have sinned and 
perverted that which was right and it profited me not he will 
deliver his soul from going into the pit and his life shall see the 
light 
lo all these things worketh god oftentimes with man to 
bring back his soul from the pit to be enlightened with the light of 
the living 
mark well o job hearken unto me hold thy peace and i will 
speak 
if thou hast anything to say answer me speak for i desire to 
justify thee 
if not hearken unto me hold thy peace and i shall teach thee 
wisdom 
furthermore elihu answered and said hear my words o ye 
wise men and give ear unto me ye that have knowledge 
for the ear trieth words as the mouth tasteth meat 
let us choose to us judgment let us know among ourselves what is 
good 
for job hath said i am righteous and god hath taken away my 
judgment 
should i lie against my right my wound is incurable without 
transgression 
what man is like job who drinketh up scorning like water 
which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity and walketh with 
wicked men 
for he hath said it profiteth a man nothing that he should 
delight himself with god 
therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding far be it 
from god that he should do wickedness and from the almighty that he 
should commit iniquity 
for the work of a man shall he render unto him and because every 
man to find according to his ways 
yea surely god will not do wickedly neither will the almighty 
pervert judgment 
who hath given him a charge over the earth or who hath disposed 
the whole world if he set his heart upon man if he gather 
unto himself his spirit and his breath all flesh shall perish 
together and man shall turn again unto dust 
if now thou hast understanding hear this hearken to the voice 
of my words 
shall even he that hateth right govern and wilt thou condemn 
him that is most just is it fit to say to a king thou art 
wicked and to princes ye are ungodly how much less to him 
that accepteth not the persons of princes nor regardeth the rich more 
than the poor for they all are the work of his hands 
in a moment shall they die and the people shall be troubled at 
midnight and pass away and the mighty shall be taken away without 
hand 
for his eyes are upon the ways of man and he seeth all his 
goings 
there is no darkness nor shadow of death where the workers of 
iniquity may hide themselves 
for he will not lay upon man more than right that he should 
enter into judgment with god 
he shall break in pieces mighty men without number and set 
others in their stead 
therefore he knoweth their works and he overturneth them in the 
night so that they are destroyed 
he striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others 
because they turned back from him and would not consider any of 
his ways so that they because the cry of the poor to come unto 
him and he heareth the cry of the afflicted 
when he giveth quietness who then can make trouble and when he 
hideth his face who then can behold him whether it be done against a 
nation or against a man only that the hypocrite reign not 
lest the people be ensnared 
surely it is meet to be said unto god i have borne 
chastisement i will not offend any more that which i see not 
teach thou me if i have done iniquity i will do no more 
should it be according to thy mind he will recompense it 
whether thou refuse or whether thou choose and not i therefore 
speak what thou knowest 
let men of understanding tell me and let a wise man hearken 
unto me 
job hath spoken without knowledge and his words were without 
wisdom 
my desire is that job may be tried unto the end because of his 
answers for wicked men 
for he addeth rebellion unto his sin he clappeth his hands 
among us and multiplieth his words against god 
elihu spake moreover and said thinkest thou this to be 
right that thou saidst my righteousness is more than god s 
for thou saidst what advantage will it be unto thee and what profit 
shall i have if i be cleansed from my sin i will answer thee 
and thy companions with thee 
look unto the heavens and see and behold the clouds which are 
higher than thou 
if thou sinnest what doest thou against him or if thy 
transgressions be multiplied what doest thou unto him if thou 
be righteous what givest thou him or what receiveth he of thine 
hand thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art and thy 
righteousness may profit the son of man 
by reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed 
to cry they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty 
but none saith where is god my maker who giveth songs in the 
night who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth and 
maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven there they cry but 
none giveth answer because of the pride of evil men 
surely god will not hear vanity neither will the almighty 
regard it 
although thou sayest thou shalt not see him yet judgment is 
before him therefore trust thou in him 
but now because it is not so he hath visited in his anger yet 
he knoweth it not in great extremity therefore doth job open 
his mouth in vain he multiplieth words without knowledge 
elihu also proceeded and said suffer me a little and i 
will shew thee that i have yet to speak on god s behalf 
i will fetch my knowledge from afar and will ascribe 
righteousness to my maker 
for truly my words shall not be false he that is perfect in 
knowledge is with thee 
behold god is mighty and despiseth not any he is mighty in 
strength and wisdom 
he preserveth not the life of the wicked but giveth right to the 
poor 
he withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous but with kings 
are they on the throne yea he doth establish them for ever and they 
are exalted 
and if they be bound in fetters and be holden in cords of 
affliction then he sheweth them their work and their 
transgressions that they have exceeded 
he openeth also their ear to discipline and commandeth that 
they return from iniquity 
if they obey and serve him they shall spend their days in 
prosperity and their years in pleasures 
but if they obey not they shall perish by the sword and they 
shall die without knowledge 
but the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath they cry not when he 
bindeth them 
they die in youth and their life is among the unclean 
he delivereth the poor in his affliction and openeth their ears 
in oppression 
even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a 
broad place where there is no straitness and that which should be 
set on thy table should be full of fatness 
but thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked judgment and 
justice take hold on thee 
because there is wrath beware lest he take thee away with his 
stroke then a great ransom cannot deliver thee 
will he esteem thy riches no not gold nor all the forces of 
strength 
desire not the night when people are cut off in their place 
take heed regard not iniquity for this hast thou chosen rather 
than affliction 
behold god exalteth by his power who teacheth like him 
who hath enjoined him his way or who can say thou hast wrought 
iniquity remember that thou magnify his work which men 
behold 
every man may see it man may behold it afar off 
behold god is great and we know him not neither can the 
number of his years be searched out 
for he maketh small the drops of water they pour down rain 
according to the vapour thereof which the clouds do drop and 
distil upon man abundantly 
also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds or the 
noise of his tabernacle behold he spreadeth his light upon 
it and covereth the bottom of the sea 
for by them judgeth he the people he giveth meat in abundance 
with clouds he covereth the light and commandeth it not to 
shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt 
the noise thereof sheweth concerning it the cattle also 
concerning the vapour 
at this also my heart trembleth and is moved out of his place 
hear attentively the noise of his voice and the sound that goeth 
out of his mouth 
he directeth it under the whole heaven and his lightning unto 
the ends of the earth 
after it a voice roareth he thundereth with the voice of his 
excellency and he will not stay them when his voice is heard 
god thundereth marvellously with his voice great things doeth 
he which we cannot comprehend 
for he saith to the snow be thou on the earth likewise to the 
small rain and to the great rain of his strength 
he sealeth up the hand of every man that all men may know his 
work 
then the beasts go into dens and remain in their places 
out of the south cometh the whirlwind and cold out of the north 
by the breath of god frost is given and the breadth of the 
waters is straitened 
also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud he scattereth his 
bright cloud and it is turned round about by his counsels that 
they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world 
in the earth 
he causeth it to come whether for correction or for his land 
or for mercy 
hearken unto this o job stand still and consider the wondrous 
works of god 
dost thou know when god disposed them and caused the light of 
his cloud to shine dost thou know the balancings of the 
clouds the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge 
how thy garments are warm when he quieteth the earth by the 
south wind hast thou with him spread out the sky which is 
strong and as a molten looking glass teach us what we shall 
say unto him for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness 
shall it be told him that i speak if a man speak surely he 
shall be swallowed up 
and now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds but 
the wind passeth and cleanseth them 
fair weather cometh out of the north with god is terrible 
majesty 
touching the almighty we cannot find him out he is excellent 
in power and in judgment and in plenty of justice he will not 
afflict 
men do therefore fear him he respecteth not any that are wise 
of heart 
then the lord answered job out of the whirlwind and said 
who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge 
gird up now thy loins like a man for i will demand of thee and 
answer thou me 
where wast thou when i laid the foundations of the earth 
declare if thou hast understanding 
who hath laid the measures thereof if thou knowest or who hath 
stretched the line upon it whereupon are the foundations 
thereof fastened or who laid the corner stone thereof when the 
morning stars sang together and all the sons of god shouted for joy 
or who shut up the sea with doors when it brake forth as if it 
had issued out of the womb when i made the cloud the garment 
thereof and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it and brake up 
for it my decreed place and set bars and doors and said 
hitherto shalt thou come but no further and here shall thy proud 
waves be stayed hast thou commanded the morning since thy 
days and caused the dayspring to know his place that it might 
take hold of the ends of the earth that the wicked might be shaken 
out of it it is turned as clay to the seal and they stand as 
a garment 
and from the wicked their light is withholden and the high arm 
shall be broken 
hast thou entered into the springs of the sea or hast thou 
walked in the search of the depth have the gates of death been 
opened unto thee or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death 
hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth declare if thou 
knowest it all 
where is the way where light dwelleth and as for darkness 
where is the place thereof that thou shouldest take it to the 
bound thereof and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house 
thereof knowest thou it because thou wast then born or 
because the number of thy days is great hast thou entered into 
the treasures of the snow or hast thou seen the treasures of the 
hail which i have reserved against the time of trouble against 
the day of battle and war by what way is the light parted 
which scattereth the east wind upon the earth who hath divided 
a watercourse for the overflowing of waters or a way for the 
lightning of thunder to cause it to rain on the earth where no 
man is on the wilderness wherein there is no man to satisfy 
the desolate and waste ground and to cause the bud of the tender herb 
to spring forth hath the rain a father or who hath begotten 
the drops of dew out of whose womb came the ice and the hoary 
frost of heaven who hath gendered it the waters are hid as 
with a stone and the face of the deep is frozen 
canst thou bind the sweet influences of pleiades or loose the 
bands of orion canst thou bring forth mazzaroth in his season 
or canst thou guide arcturus with his sons knowest thou the 
ordinances of heaven canst thou set the dominion thereof in the 
earth canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds that 
abundance of waters may cover thee canst thou send lightnings 
that they may go and say unto thee here we are who hath put 
wisdom in the inward parts or who hath given understanding to the 
heart who can number the clouds in wisdom or who can stay the 
bottles of heaven when the dust groweth into hardness and the 
clods cleave fast together wilt thou hunt the prey for the 
lion or fill the appetite of the young lions when they couch 
in their dens and abide in the covert to lie in wait who 
provideth for the raven his food when his young ones cry unto god 
they wander for lack of meat 
knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring 
forth or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve canst thou 
number the months that they fulfil or knowest thou the time when they 
bring forth they bow themselves they bring forth their young 
ones they cast out their sorrows 
their young ones are in good liking they grow up with corn they 
go forth and return not unto them 
who hath sent out the wild ass free or who hath loosed the bands 
of the wild ass whose house i have made the wilderness and the 
barren land his dwellings 
he scorneth the multitude of the city neither regardeth he the 
crying of the driver 
the range of the mountains is his pasture and he searcheth after 
every green thing 
will the unicorn be willing to serve thee or abide by thy crib 
canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow or will 
he harrow the valleys after thee wilt thou trust him because 
his strength is great or wilt thou leave thy labour to him 
wilt thou believe him that he will bring home thy seed and gather it 
into thy barn gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks 
or wings and feathers unto the ostrich which leaveth her eggs 
in the earth and warmeth them in dust and forgetteth that the 
foot may crush them or that the wild beast may break them 
she is hardened against her young ones as though they were not 
her s her labour is in vain without fear because god hath 
deprived her of wisdom neither hath he imparted to her understanding 
what time she lifteth up herself on high she scorneth the horse 
and his rider 
hast thou given the horse strength hast thou clothed his neck 
with thunder canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper the 
glory of his nostrils is terrible 
he paweth in the valley and rejoiceth in his strength he goeth 
on to meet the armed men 
he mocketh at fear and is not affrighted neither turneth he 
back from the sword 
the quiver rattleth against him the glittering spear and the 
shield 
he swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage neither 
believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet 
he saith among the trumpets ha ha and he smelleth the battle 
afar off the thunder of the captains and the shouting 
doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom and stretch her wings toward 
the south doth the eagle mount up at thy command and make her 
nest on high she dwelleth and abideth on the rock upon the 
crag of the rock and the strong place 
from thence she seeketh the prey and her eyes behold afar off 
her young ones also suck up blood and where the slain are 
there is she 
moreover the lord answered job and said shall he that 
contendeth with the almighty instruct him he that reproveth god let 
him answer it 
then job answered the lord and said behold i am vile 
what shall i answer thee i will lay mine hand upon my mouth 
once have i spoken but i will not answer yea twice but i will 
proceed no further 
then answered the lord unto job out of the whirlwind and said 
gird up thy loins now like a man i will demand of thee and 
declare thou unto me 
wilt thou also disannul my judgment wilt thou condemn me that 
thou mayest be righteous hast thou an arm like god or canst 
thou thunder with a voice like him deck thyself now with 
majesty and excellency and array thyself with glory and beauty 
cast abroad the rage of thy wrath and behold every one that is 
proud and abase him 
look on every one that is proud and bring him low and tread 
down the wicked in their place 
hide them in the dust together and bind their faces in secret 
then will i also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can 
save thee 
behold now behemoth which i made with thee he eateth grass as 
an ox 
lo now his strength is in his loins and his force is in the 
navel of his belly 
he moveth his tail like a cedar the sinews of his stones are 
wrapped together 
his bones are as strong pieces of brass his bones are like bars 
of iron 
he is the chief of the ways of god he that made him can make 
his sword to approach unto him 
surely the mountains bring him forth food where all the beasts 
of the field play 
he lieth under the shady trees in the covert of the reed and 
fens 
the shady trees cover him with their shadow the willows of the 
brook compass him about 
behold he drinketh up a river and hasteth not he trusteth 
that he can draw up jordan into his mouth 
he taketh it with his eyes his nose pierceth through snares 
canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook or his tongue with a 
cord which thou lettest down canst thou put an hook into his 
nose or bore his jaw through with a thorn will he make many 
supplications unto thee will he speak soft words unto thee 
will he make a covenant with thee wilt thou take him for a servant 
for ever wilt thou play with him as with a bird or wilt thou 
bind him for thy maidens shall the companions make a banquet of 
him shall they part him among the merchants canst thou fill 
his skin with barbed irons or his head with fish spears lay 
thine hand upon him remember the battle do no more 
behold the hope of him is in vain shall not one be cast down 
even at the sight of him none is so fierce that dare stir him 
up who then is able to stand before me who hath prevented me 
that i should repay him whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine 
i will not conceal his parts nor his power nor his comely 
proportion 
who can discover the face of his garment or who can come to him 
with his double bridle who can open the doors of his face his 
teeth are terrible round about 
his scales are his pride shut up together as with a close seal 
one is so near to another that no air can come between them 
they are joined one to another they stick together that they 
cannot be sundered 
by his neesings a light doth shine and his eyes are like the 
eyelids of the morning 
out of his mouth go burning lamps and sparks of fire leap out 
out of his nostrils goeth smoke as out of a seething pot or 
caldron 
his breath kindleth coals and a flame goeth out of his mouth 
in his neck remaineth strength and sorrow is turned into joy 
before him 
the flakes of his flesh are joined together they are firm in 
themselves they cannot be moved 
his heart is as firm as a stone yea as hard as a piece of the 
nether millstone 
when he raiseth up himself the mighty are afraid by reason of 
breakings they purify themselves 
the sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold the spear the 
dart nor the habergeon 
he esteemeth iron as straw and brass as rotten wood 
the arrow cannot make him flee slingstones are turned with him 
into stubble 
darts are counted as stubble he laugheth at the shaking of a 
spear 
sharp stones are under him he spreadeth sharp pointed things 
upon the mire 
he maketh the deep to boil like a pot he maketh the sea like a 
pot of ointment 
he maketh a path to shine after him one would think the deep to 
be hoary 
upon earth there is not his like who is made without fear 
he beholdeth all high things he is a king over all the children 
of pride 
then job answered the lord and said i know that thou canst 
do every thing and that no thought can be withholden from thee 
who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge therefore have i 
uttered that i understood not things too wonderful for me which i 
knew not 
hear i beseech thee and i will speak i will demand of thee 
and declare thou unto me 
i have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear but now mine eye 
seeth thee 
wherefore i abhor myself and repent in dust and ashes 
and it was so that after the lord had spoken these words unto 
job the lord said to eliphaz the temanite my wrath is kindled 
against thee and against thy two friends for ye have not spoken of 
me the thing that is right as my servant job hath 
therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams and go 
to my servant job and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering and 
my servant job shall pray for you for him will i accept lest i deal 
with you after your folly in that ye have not spoken of me the thing 
which is right like my servant job 
so eliphaz the temanite and bildad the shuhite and zophar the 
naamathite went and did according as the lord commanded them the 
lord also accepted job 
and the lord turned the captivity of job when he prayed for his 
friends also the lord gave job twice as much as he had before 
then came there unto him all his brethren and all his sisters 
and all they that had been of his acquaintance before and did eat 
bread with him in his house and they bemoaned him and comforted him 
over all the evil that the lord had brought upon him every man also 
gave him a piece of money and every one an earring of gold 
so the lord blessed the latter end of job more than his 
beginning for he had fourteen thousand sheep and six thousand 
camels and a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand she asses 
he had also seven sons and three daughters 
and he called the name of the first jemima and the name of the 
second kezia and the name of the third kerenhappuch 
and in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters 
of job and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren 
after this lived job an hundred and forty years and saw his 
sons and his sons sons even four generations 
so job died being old and full of days 
the book of psalms 
blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly 
nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the 
scornful 
but his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law doth he 
meditate day and night 
and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that 
bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leaf also shall not 
wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper 
the ungodly are not so but are like the chaff which the wind 
driveth away 
therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment nor sinners 
in the congregation of the righteous 
for the lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the 
ungodly shall perish 
why do the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing 
the kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel 
together against the lord and against his anointed saying 
let us break their bands asunder and cast away their cords from 
us 
he that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh the lord shall have 
them in derision 
then shall he speak unto them in his wrath and vex them in his 
sore displeasure 
yet have i set my king upon my holy hill of zion 
i will declare the decree the lord hath said unto me thou art my 
son this day have i begotten thee 
ask of me and i shall give thee the heathen for thine 
inheritance and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession 
thou shalt break them with a rod of iron thou shalt dash them in 
pieces like a potter s vessel 
be wise now therefore o ye kings be instructed ye judges of 
the earth 
serve the lord with fear and rejoice with trembling 
kiss the son lest he be angry and ye perish from the way when 
his wrath is kindled but a little blessed are all they that put their 
trust in him 
lord how are they increased that trouble me many are they that 
rise up against me 
many there be which say of my soul there is no help for him in 
god 
selah 
but thou o lord art a shield for me my glory and the lifter up 
of mine head 
i cried unto the lord with my voice and he heard me out of his 
holy hill selah 
i laid me down and slept i awaked for the lord sustained me 
i will not be afraid of ten thousands of people that have set 
themselves against me round about 
arise o lord save me o my god for thou hast smitten all mine 
enemies upon the cheek bone thou hast broken the teeth of the 
ungodly 
salvation belongeth unto the lord thy blessing is upon thy 
people 
selah 
hear me when i call o god of my righteousness thou hast enlarged 
me when i was in distress have mercy upon me and hear my prayer 
o ye sons of men how long will ye turn my glory into shame how 
long will ye love vanity and seek after leasing selah 
but know that the lord hath set apart him that is godly for 
himself the lord will hear when i call unto him 
stand in awe and sin not commune with your own heart upon your 
bed and be still selah 
offer the sacrifices of righteousness and put your trust in the 
lord 
there be many that say who will shew us any good lord lift thou 
up the light of thy countenance upon us 
thou hast put gladness in my heart more than in the time that 
their corn and their wine increased 
i will both lay me down in peace and sleep for thou lord only 
makest me dwell in safety 
give ear to my words o lord consider my meditation 
hearken unto the voice of my cry my king and my god for unto 
thee will i pray 
my voice shalt thou hear in the morning o lord in the morning 
will i direct my prayer unto thee and will look up 
for thou art not a god that hath pleasure in wickedness neither 
shall evil dwell with thee 
the foolish shall not stand in thy sight thou hatest all workers 
of iniquity 
thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing the lord will abhor 
the bloody and deceitful man 
but as for me i will come into thy house in the multitude of thy 
mercy and in thy fear will i worship toward thy holy temple 
lead me o lord in thy righteousness because of mine enemies 
make thy way straight before my face 
for there is no faithfulness in their mouth their inward part is 
very wickedness their throat is an open sepulchre they flatter with 
their tongue 
destroy thou them o god let them fall by their own counsels 
cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions for they have 
rebelled against thee 
but let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice let them 
ever shout for joy because thou defendest them let them also that 
love thy name be joyful in thee 
for thou lord wilt bless the righteous with favour wilt thou 
compass him as with a shield 
o lord rebuke me not in thine anger neither chasten me in thy 
hot displeasure 
have mercy upon me o lord for i am weak o lord heal me for my 
bones are vexed 
my soul is also sore vexed but thou o lord how long 
return o lord deliver my soul oh save me for thy mercies sake 
for in death there is no remembrance of thee in the grave who 
shall give thee thanks 
i am weary with my groaning all the night make i my bed to swim 
i water my couch with my tears 
mine eye is consumed because of grief it waxeth old because of 
all mine enemies 
depart from me all ye workers of iniquity for the lord hath 
heard the voice of my weeping 
the lord hath heard my supplication the lord will receive my 
prayer 
let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed let them return 
and be ashamed suddenly 
o lord my god in thee do i put my trust save me from all them 
that persecute me and deliver me 
lest he tear my soul like a lion rending it in pieces while 
there is none to deliver 
o lord my god if i have done this if there be iniquity in my 
hands 
if i have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me yea 
i have delivered him that without because is mine enemy 
let the enemy persecute my soul and take it yea let him tread 
down my life upon the earth and lay mine honour in the dust selah 
arise o lord in thine anger lift up thyself because of the rage 
of mine enemies and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast 
commanded 
so shall the congregation of the people compass thee about for 
their sakes therefore return thou on high 
the lord shall judge the people judge me o lord according to my 
righteousness and according to mine integrity that is in me 
oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end but establish 
the just for the righteous god trieth the hearts and reins 
my defence is of god which saveth the upright in heart 
god judgeth the righteous and god is angry with the wicked every 
day 
if he turn not he will whet his sword he hath bent his bow and 
made it ready 
he hath also prepared for him the instruments of death he 
ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors 
behold he travaileth with iniquity and hath conceived mischief 
and brought forth falsehood 
he made a pit and digged it and is fallen into the ditch which 
he made 
his mischief shall return upon his own head and his violent 
dealing shall come down upon his own pate 
i will praise the lord according to his righteousness and will 
sing praise to the name of the lord most high 
o lord our lord how excellent is thy name in all the earth who 
hast set thy glory above the heavens 
out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained 
strength because of thine enemies that thou mightest still the enemy 
and the avenger 
when i consider thy heavens the work of thy fingers the moon and 
the stars which thou hast ordained 
what is man that thou art mindful of him and the son of man 
that thou visitest him 
for thou hast made him a little lower than the angels and hast 
crowned him with glory and honour 
thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands thou 
hast put all things under his feet 
all sheep and oxen yea and the beasts of the field 
the fowl of the air and the fish of the sea and whatsoever 
passeth through the paths of the seas 
o lord our lord how excellent is thy name in all the earth 
i will praise thee o lord with my whole heart i will shew forth 
all thy marvellous works 
i will be glad and rejoice in thee i will sing praise to thy 
name o thou most high 
when mine enemies are turned back they shall fall and perish at 
thy presence 
for thou hast maintained my right and my because thou satest in the 
throne judging right 
thou hast rebuked the heathen thou hast destroyed the wicked 
thou hast put out their name for ever and ever 
o thou enemy destructions are come to a perpetual end and thou 
hast destroyed cities their memorial is perished with them 
but the lord shall endure for ever he hath prepared his throne 
for judgment 
and he shall judge the world in righteousness he shall minister 
judgment to the people in uprightness 
the lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed a refuge in 
times of trouble 
and they that know thy name will put their trust in thee for 
thou lord hast not forsaken them that seek thee 
sing praises to the lord which dwelleth in zion declare among 
the people his doings 
when he maketh inquisition for blood he remembereth them he 
forgetteth not the cry of the humble 
have mercy upon me o lord consider my trouble which i suffer of 
them that hate me thou that liftest me up from the gates of death 
that i may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter 
of zion i will rejoice in thy salvation 
the heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made in the net 
which they hid is their own foot taken 
the lord is known by the judgment which he executeth the wicked 
is snared in the work of his own hands higgaion selah 
the wicked shall be turned into hell and all the nations that 
forget god 
for the needy shall not alway be forgotten the expectation of 
the poor shall not perish for ever 
arise o lord let not man prevail let the heathen be judged in 
thy sight 
put them in fear o lord that the nations may know themselves to 
be but men selah 
why standest thou afar off o lord why hidest thou thyself in 
times of trouble 
the wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor let them be 
taken in the devices that they have imagined 
for the wicked boasteth of his heart s desire and blesseth the 
covetous whom the lord abhorreth 
the wicked through the pride of his countenance will not seek 
after god god is not in all his thoughts 
his ways are always grievous thy judgments are far above out of 
his sight as for all his enemies he puffeth at them 
he hath said in his heart i shall not be moved for i shall 
never be in adversity 
his mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud under his 
tongue is mischief and vanity 
he sitteth in the lurking places of the villages in the secret 
places doth he murder the innocent his eyes are privily set against 
the poor 
he lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den he lieth in wait 
to catch the poor he doth catch the poor when he draweth him into 
his net 
he croucheth and humbleth himself that the poor may fall by 
his strong ones 
he hath said in his heart god hath forgotten he hideth his 
face he will never see it 
arise o lord o god lift up thine hand forget not the humble 
wherefore doth the wicked contemn god he hath said in his 
heart thou wilt not require it 
thou hast seen it for thou beholdest mischief and spite to 
requite it with thy hand the poor committeth himself unto thee thou 
art the helper of the fatherless 
break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man seek out his 
wickedness till thou find none 
the lord is king for ever and ever the heathen are perished out 
of his land 
lord thou hast heard the desire of the humble thou wilt 
prepare their heart thou wilt because thine ear to hear 
to judge the fatherless and the oppressed that the man of the 
earth may no more oppress 
in the lord put i my trust how say ye to my soul flee as a bird 
to your mountain 
for lo the wicked bend their bow they make ready their arrow 
upon the string that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart 
if the foundations be destroyed what can the righteous do 
the lord is in his holy temple the lord s throne is in heaven 
his eyes behold his eyelids try the children of men 
the lord trieth the righteous but the wicked and him that loveth 
violence his soul hateth 
upon the wicked he shall rain snares fire and brimstone and an 
horrible tempest this shall be the portion of their cup 
for the righteous lord loveth righteousness his countenance doth 
behold the upright 
help lord for the godly man ceaseth for the faithful fail from 
among the children of men 
they speak vanity every one with his neighbour with flattering 
lips and with a double heart do they speak 
the lord shall cut off all flattering lips and the tongue that 
speaketh proud things 
who have said with our tongue will we prevail our lips are our 
own who is lord over us 
for the oppression of the poor for the sighing of the needy now 
will i arise saith the lord i will set him in safety from him that 
puffeth at him 
the words of the lord are pure words as silver tried in a 
furnace of earth purified seven times 
thou shalt keep them o lord thou shalt preserve them from this 
generation for ever 
the wicked walk on every side when the vilest men are exalted 
how long wilt thou forget me o lord for ever how long wilt 
thou hide thy face from me 
how long shall i take counsel in my soul having sorrow in my 
heart daily how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me 
consider and hear me o lord my god lighten mine eyes lest i 
sleep the sleep of death 
lest mine enemy say i have prevailed against him and those that 
trouble me rejoice when i am moved 
but i have trusted in thy mercy my heart shall rejoice in thy 
salvation 
i will sing unto the lord because he hath dealt bountifully with 
me 
the fool hath said in his heart there is no god they are 
corrupt they have done abominable works there is none that doeth 
good 
the lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men to see 
if there were any that did understand and seek god 
they are all gone aside they are all together become filthy 
there is none that doeth good no not one 
have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge who eat up my 
people as they eat bread and call not upon the lord 
there were they in great fear for god is in the generation of 
the righteous 
ye have shamed the counsel of the poor because the lord is his 
refuge 
oh that the salvation of israel were come out of zion when the 
lord bringeth back the captivity of his people jacob shall rejoice 
and israel shall be glad 
lord who shall abide in thy tabernacle who shall dwell in thy 
holy hill 
he that walketh uprightly and worketh righteousness and 
speaketh the truth in his heart 
he that backbiteth not with his tongue nor doeth evil to his 
neighbour nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour 
in whose eyes a vile person is contemned but he honoureth them 
that fear the lord he that sweareth to his own hurt and changeth 
not 
he that putteth not out his money to usury nor taketh reward 
against the innocent he that doeth these things shall never be moved 
preserve me o god for in thee do i put my trust 
o my soul thou hast said unto the lord thou art my lord my 
goodness extendeth not to thee 
but to the saints that are in the earth and to the excellent in 
whom is all my delight 
their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god 
their drink offerings of blood will i not offer nor take up their 
names into my lips 
the lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup thou 
maintainest my lot 
the lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places yea i have a 
goodly heritage 
i will bless the lord who hath given me counsel my reins also 
instruct me in the night seasons 
i have set the lord always before me because he is at my right 
hand i shall not be moved 
therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoiceth my flesh also 
shall rest in hope 
for thou wilt not leave my soul in hell neither wilt thou 
suffer thine holy one to see corruption 
thou wilt shew me the path of life in thy presence is fulness 
of joy at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore 
hear the right o lord attend unto my cry give ear unto my 
prayer that goeth not out of feigned lips 
let my sentence come forth from thy presence let thine eyes 
behold the things that are equal 
thou hast proved mine heart thou hast visited me in the night 
thou hast tried me and shalt find nothing i am purposed that my 
mouth shall not transgress 
concerning the works of men by the word of thy lips i have kept 
me from the paths of the destroyer 
hold up my goings in thy paths that my footsteps slip not 
i have called upon thee for thou wilt hear me o god incline 
thine ear unto me and hear my speech 
shew thy marvellous lovingkindness o thou that savest by thy 
right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up 
against them 
keep me as the apple of the eye hide me under the shadow of thy 
wings 
from the wicked that oppress me from my deadly enemies who 
compass me about 
they are inclosed in their own fat with their mouth they speak 
proudly 
they have now compassed us in our steps they have set their 
eyes bowing down to the earth 
like as a lion that is greedy of his prey and as it were a 
young lion lurking in secret places 
arise o lord disappoint him cast him down deliver my soul 
from the wicked which is thy sword 
from men which are thy hand o lord from men of the world 
which have their portion in this life and whose belly thou fillest 
with thy hid treasure they are full of children and leave the rest 
of their substance to their babes 
as for me i will behold thy face in righteousness i shall be 
satisfied when i awake with thy likeness 
i will love thee o lord my strength 
the lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer my god 
my strength in whom i will trust my buckler and the horn of my 
salvation and my high tower 
i will call upon the lord who is worthy to be praised so shall 
i be saved from mine enemies 
the sorrows of death compassed me and the floods of ungodly men 
made me afraid 
the sorrows of hell compassed me about the snares of death 
prevented me 
in my distress i called upon the lord and cried unto my god he 
heard my voice out of his temple and my cry came before him even 
into his ears 
then the earth shook and trembled the foundations also of the 
hills moved and were shaken because he was wroth 
there went up a smoke out of his nostrils and fire out of his 
mouth devoured coals were kindled by it 
he bowed the heavens also and came down and darkness was under 
his feet 
and he rode upon a cherub and did fly yea he did fly upon the 
wings of the wind 
he made darkness his secret place his pavilion round about him 
were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies 
at the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed 
hail stones and coals of fire 
the lord also thundered in the heavens and the highest gave his 
voice hail stones and coals of fire 
yea he sent out his arrows and scattered them and he shot out 
lightnings and discomfited them 
then the channels of waters were seen and the foundations of 
the world were discovered at thy rebuke o lord at the blast of the 
breath of thy nostrils 
he sent from above he took me he drew me out of many waters 
he delivered me from my strong enemy and from them which hated 
me for they were too strong for me 
they prevented me in the day of my calamity but the lord was my 
stay 
he brought me forth also into a large place he delivered me 
because he delighted in me 
the lord rewarded me according to my righteousness according to 
the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me 
for i have kept the ways of the lord and have not wickedly 
departed from my god 
for all his judgments were before me and i did not put away his 
statutes from me 
i was also upright before him and i kept myself from mine 
iniquity 
therefore hath the lord recompensed me according to my 
righteousness according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight 
with the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful with an 
upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright 
with the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure and with the froward 
thou wilt shew thyself froward 
for thou wilt save the afflicted people but wilt bring down 
high looks 
for thou wilt light my candle the lord my god will enlighten my 
darkness 
for by thee i have run through a troop and by my god have i 
leaped over a wall 
as for god his way is perfect the word of the lord is tried 
he is a buckler to all those that trust in him 
for who is god save the lord or who is a rock save our god 
it is god that girdeth me with strength and maketh my way 
perfect 
he maketh my feet like hinds feet and setteth me upon my high 
places 
he teacheth my hands to war so that a bow of steel is broken by 
mine arms 
thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation and thy 
right hand hath holden me up and thy gentleness hath made me great 
thou hast enlarged my steps under me that my feet did not slip 
i have pursued mine enemies and overtaken them neither did i 
turn again till they were consumed 
i have wounded them that they were not able to rise they are 
fallen under my feet 
for thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle thou hast 
subdued under me those that rose up against me 
thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies that i might 
destroy them that hate me 
they cried but there was none to save them even unto the lord 
but he answered them not 
then did i beat them small as the dust before the wind i did 
cast them out as the dirt in the streets 
thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people and 
thou hast made me the head of the heathen a people whom i have not 
known shall serve me 
as soon as they hear of me they shall obey me the strangers 
shall submit themselves unto me 
the strangers shall fade away and be afraid out of their close 
places 
the lord liveth and blessed be my rock and let the god of my 
salvation be exalted 
it is god that avengeth me and subdueth the people under me 
he delivereth me from mine enemies yea thou liftest me up 
above those that rise up against me thou hast delivered me from the 
violent man 
therefore will i give thanks unto thee o lord among the 
heathen and sing praises unto thy name 
great deliverance giveth he to his king and sheweth mercy to 
his anointed to david and to his seed for evermore 
the heavens declare the glory of god and the firmament sheweth 
his handywork 
day unto day uttereth speech and night unto night sheweth 
knowledge 
there is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard 
their line is gone out through all the earth and their words to 
the end of the world in them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun 
which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and rejoiceth 
as a strong man to run a race 
his going forth is from the end of the heaven and his circuit 
unto the ends of it and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof 
the law of the lord is perfect converting the soul the 
testimony of the lord is sure making wise the simple 
the statutes of the lord are right rejoicing the heart the 
commandment of the lord is pure enlightening the eyes 
the fear of the lord is clean enduring for ever the judgments 
of the lord are true and righteous altogether 
more to be desired are they than gold yea than much fine gold 
sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb 
moreover by them is thy servant warned and in keeping of them 
there is great reward 
who can understand his errors cleanse thou me from secret 
faults 
keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins let them not 
have dominion over me then shall i be upright and i shall be 
innocent from the great transgression 
let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be 
acceptable in thy sight o lord my strength and my redeemer 
the lord hear thee in the day of trouble the name of the god of 
jacob defend thee 
send thee help from the sanctuary and strengthen thee out of 
zion 
remember all thy offerings and accept thy burnt sacrifice 
selah 
grant thee according to thine own heart and fulfil all thy 
counsel 
we will rejoice in thy salvation and in the name of our god we 
will set up our banners the lord fulfil all thy petitions 
now know i that the lord saveth his anointed he will hear him 
from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand 
some trust in chariots and some in horses but we will remember 
the name of the lord our god 
they are brought down and fallen but we are risen and stand 
upright 
save lord let the king hear us when we call 
the king shall joy in thy strength o lord and in thy salvation 
how greatly shall he rejoice 
thou hast given him his heart s desire and hast not withholden 
the request of his lips selah 
for thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness thou 
settest a crown of pure gold on his head 
he asked life of thee and thou gavest it him even length of 
days for ever and ever 
his glory is great in thy salvation honour and majesty hast thou 
laid upon him 
for thou hast made him most blessed for ever thou hast made him 
exceeding glad with thy countenance 
for the king trusteth in the lord and through the mercy of the 
most high he shall not be moved 
thine hand shall find out all thine enemies thy right hand shall 
find out those that hate thee 
thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger 
the lord shall swallow them up in his wrath and the fire shall devour 
them 
their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth and their seed 
from among the children of men 
for they intended evil against thee they imagined a mischievous 
device which they are not able to perform 
therefore shalt thou make them turn their back when thou shalt 
make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them 
be thou exalted lord in thine own strength so will we sing 
and praise thy power 
my god my god why hast thou forsaken me why art thou so far 
from helping me and from the words of my roaring 
o my god i cry in the day time but thou hearest not and in the 
night season and am not silent 
but thou art holy o thou that inhabitest the praises of israel 
our fathers trusted in thee they trusted and thou didst deliver 
them 
they cried unto thee and were delivered they trusted in thee 
and were not confounded 
but i am a worm and no man a reproach of men and despised of 
the people 
all they that see me laugh me to scorn they shoot out the lip 
they shake the head saying 
he trusted on the lord that he would deliver him let him deliver 
him seeing he delighted in him 
but thou art he that took me out of the womb thou didst make me 
hope when i was upon my mother s breasts 
i was cast upon thee from the womb thou art my god from my 
mother s belly 
be not far from me for trouble is near for there is none to 
help 
many bulls have compassed me strong bulls of bashan have beset 
me round 
they gaped upon me with their mouths as a ravening and a 
roaring lion 
i am poured out like water and all my bones are out of joint 
my heart is like wax it is melted in the midst of my bowels 
my strength is dried up like a potsherd and my tongue cleaveth 
to my jaws and thou hast brought me into the dust of death 
for dogs have compassed me the assembly of the wicked have 
inclosed me they pierced my hands and my feet 
i may tell all my bones they look and stare upon me 
they part my garments among them and cast lots upon my vesture 
but be not thou far from me o lord o my strength haste thee 
to help me 
deliver my soul from the sword my darling from the power of the 
dog 
save me from the lion s mouth for thou hast heard me from the 
horns of the unicorns 
i will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the 
congregation will i praise thee 
ye that fear the lord praise him all ye the seed of jacob 
glorify him and fear him all ye the seed of israel 
for he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the 
afflicted neither hath he hid his face from him but when he cried 
unto him he heard 
my praise shall be of thee in the great congregation i will pay 
my vows before them that fear him 
the meek shall eat and be satisfied they shall praise the lord 
that seek him your heart shall live for ever 
all the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the lord 
and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee 
for the kingdom is the lord s and he is the governor among the 
nations 
all they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship all they 
that go down to the dust shall bow before him and none can keep alive 
his own soul 
a seed shall serve him it shall be accounted to the lord for a 
generation 
they shall come and shall declare his righteousness unto a 
people that shall be born that he hath done this 
the lord is my shepherd i shall not want 
he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside 
the still waters 
he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness 
for his name s sake 
yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i 
will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they 
comfort me 
thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies 
thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over 
surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my 
life and i will dwell in the house of the lord for ever 
the earth is the lord s and the fulness thereof the world and 
they that dwell therein 
for he hath founded it upon the seas and established it upon the 
floods 
who shall ascend into the hill of the lord or who shall stand in 
his holy place 
he that hath clean hands and a pure heart who hath not lifted 
up his soul unto vanity nor sworn deceitfully 
he shall receive the blessing from the lord and righteousness 
from the god of his salvation 
this is the generation of them that seek him that seek thy face 
o jacob selah 
lift up your heads o ye gates and be ye lift up ye everlasting 
doors and the king of glory shall come in 
who is this king of glory the lord strong and mighty the lord 
mighty in battle 
lift up your heads o ye gates even lift them up ye everlasting 
doors and the king of glory shall come in 
who is this king of glory the lord of hosts he is the king of 
glory selah 
unto thee o lord do i lift up my soul 
o my god i trust in thee let me not be ashamed let not mine 
enemies triumph over me 
yea let none that wait on thee be ashamed let them be ashamed 
which transgress without because 
shew me thy ways o lord teach me thy paths 
lead me in thy truth and teach me for thou art the god of my 
salvation on thee do i wait all the day 
remember o lord thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses 
for they have been ever of old 
remember not the sins of my youth nor my transgressions 
according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness sake o 
lord 
good and upright is the lord therefore will he teach sinners in 
the way 
the meek will he guide in judgment and the meek will he teach 
his way 
all the paths of the lord are mercy and truth unto such as keep 
his covenant and his testimonies 
for thy name s sake o lord pardon mine iniquity for it is 
great 
what man is he that feareth the lord him shall he teach in the 
way that he shall choose 
his soul shall dwell at ease and his seed shall inherit the 
earth 
the secret of the lord is with them that fear him and he will 
shew them his covenant 
mine eyes are ever toward the lord for he shall pluck my feet 
out of the net 
turn thee unto me and have mercy upon me for i am desolate and 
afflicted 
the troubles of my heart are enlarged o bring thou me out of my 
distresses 
look upon mine affliction and my pain and forgive all my sins 
consider mine enemies for they are many and they hate me with 
cruel hatred 
o keep my soul and deliver me let me not be ashamed for i put 
my trust in thee 
let integrity and uprightness preserve me for i wait on thee 
redeem israel o god out of all his troubles 
judge me o lord for i have walked in mine integrity i have 
trusted also in the lord therefore i shall not slide 
examine me o lord and prove me try my reins and my heart 
for thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes and i have walked in 
thy truth 
i have not sat with vain persons neither will i go in with 
dissemblers 
i have hated the congregation of evil doers and will not sit 
with the wicked 
i will wash mine hands in innocency so will i compass thine 
altar o lord 
that i may publish with the voice of thanksgiving and tell of 
all thy wondrous works 
lord i have loved the habitation of thy house and the place 
where thine honour dwelleth 
gather not my soul with sinners nor my life with bloody men 
in whose hands is mischief and their right hand is full of 
bribes 
but as for me i will walk in mine integrity redeem me and be 
merciful unto me 
my foot standeth in an even place in the congregations will i 
bless the lord 
the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the 
lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid 
when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes came upon me to 
eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell 
though an host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear 
though war should rise against me in this will i be confident 
one thing have i desired of the lord that will i seek after 
that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to 
behold the beauty of the lord and to enquire in his temple 
for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in 
the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon 
a rock 
and now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round 
about me therefore will i offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy 
i will sing yea i will sing praises unto the lord 
hear o lord when i cry with my voice have mercy also upon me 
and answer me 
when thou saidst seek ye my face my heart said unto thee thy 
face lord will i seek 
hide not thy face far from me put not thy servant away in anger 
thou hast been my help leave me not neither forsake me o god of my 
salvation 
when my father and my mother forsake me then the lord will take 
me up 
teach me thy way o lord and lead me in a plain path because 
of mine enemies 
deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies for false 
witnesses are risen up against me and such as breathe out cruelty 
i had fainted unless i had believed to see the goodness of the 
lord in the land of the living 
wait on the lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen 
thine heart wait i say on the lord 
unto thee will i cry o lord my rock be not silent to me lest 
if thou be silent to me i become like them that go down into the pit 
hear the voice of my supplications when i cry unto thee when i 
lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle 
draw me not away with the wicked and with the workers of 
iniquity which speak peace to their neighbours but mischief is in 
their hearts 
give them according to their deeds and according to the 
wickedness of their endeavours give them after the work of their 
hands render to them their desert 
because they regard not the works of the lord nor the operation 
of his hands he shall destroy them and not build them up 
blessed be the lord because he hath heard the voice of my 
supplications 
the lord is my strength and my shield my heart trusted in him 
and i am helped therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth and with my 
song will i praise him 
the lord is their strength and he is the saving strength of his 
anointed 
save thy people and bless thine inheritance feed them also and 
lift them up for ever 
give unto the lord o ye mighty give unto the lord glory and 
strength 
give unto the lord the glory due unto his name worship the lord 
in the beauty of holiness 
the voice of the lord is upon the waters the god of glory 
thundereth the lord is upon many waters 
the voice of the lord is powerful the voice of the lord is full 
of majesty 
the voice of the lord breaketh the cedars yea the lord breaketh 
the cedars of lebanon 
he maketh them also to skip like a calf lebanon and sirion like 
a young unicorn 
the voice of the lord divideth the flames of fire 
the voice of the lord shaketh the wilderness the lord shaketh 
the wilderness of kadesh 
the voice of the lord maketh the hinds to calve and discovereth 
the forests and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory 
the lord sitteth upon the flood yea the lord sitteth king for 
ever 
the lord will give strength unto his people the lord will bless 
his people with peace 
i will extol thee o lord for thou hast lifted me up and hast 
not made my foes to rejoice over me 
o lord my god i cried unto thee and thou hast healed me 
o lord thou hast brought up my soul from the grave thou hast 
kept me alive that i should not go down to the pit 
sing unto the lord o ye saints of his and give thanks at the 
remembrance of his holiness 
for his anger endureth but a moment in his favour is life 
weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning 
and in my prosperity i said i shall never be moved 
lord by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong 
thou didst hide thy face and i was troubled 
i cried to thee o lord and unto the lord i made supplication 
what profit is there in my blood when i go down to the pit 
shall the dust praise thee shall it declare thy truth 
hear o lord and have mercy upon me lord be thou my helper 
thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing thou hast put 
off my sackcloth and girded me with gladness 
to the end that my glory may sing praise to thee and not be 
silent 
o lord my god i will give thanks unto thee for ever 
in thee o lord do i put my trust let me never be ashamed 
deliver me in thy righteousness 
bow down thine ear to me deliver me speedily be thou my strong 
rock for an house of defence to save me 
for thou art my rock and my fortress therefore for thy name s 
sake lead me and guide me 
pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me for 
thou art my strength 
into thine hand i commit my spirit thou hast redeemed me o lord 
god of truth 
i have hated them that regard lying vanities but i trust in the 
lord 
i will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy for thou hast considered 
my trouble thou hast known my soul in adversities 
and hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy thou hast set 
my feet in a large room 
have mercy upon me o lord for i am in trouble mine eye is 
consumed with grief yea my soul and my belly 
for my life is spent with grief and my years with sighing my 
strength faileth because of mine iniquity and my bones are consumed 
i was a reproach among all mine enemies but especially among my 
neighbours and a fear to mine acquaintance they that did see me 
without fled from me 
i am forgotten as a dead man out of mind i am like a broken 
vessel 
for i have heard the slander of many fear was on every side 
while they took counsel together against me they devised to take away 
my life 
but i trusted in thee o lord i said thou art my god 
my times are in thy hand deliver me from the hand of mine 
enemies and from them that persecute me 
make thy face to shine upon thy servant save me for thy 
mercies sake 
let me not be ashamed o lord for i have called upon thee let 
the wicked be ashamed and let them be silent in the grave 
let the lying lips be put to silence which speak grievous 
things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous 
oh how great is thy goodness which thou hast laid up for them 
that fear thee which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee 
before the sons of men 
thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the 
pride of man thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the 
strife of tongues 
blessed be the lord for he hath shewed me his marvellous 
kindness in a strong city 
for i said in my haste i am cut off from before thine eyes 
nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when i cried 
unto thee 
o love the lord all ye his saints for the lord preserveth the 
faithful and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer 
be of good courage and he shall strengthen your heart all ye 
that hope in the lord 
blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven whose sin is 
covered 
blessed is the man unto whom the lord imputeth not iniquity and 
in whose spirit there is no guile 
when i kept silence my bones waxed old through my roaring all 
the day long 
for day and night thy hand was heavy upon me my moisture is 
turned into the drought of summer selah 
i acknowledge my sin unto thee and mine iniquity have i not hid 
i said i will confess my transgressions unto the lord and thou 
forgavest the iniquity of my sin selah 
for this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time 
when thou mayest be found surely in the floods of great waters they 
shall not come nigh unto him 
thou art my hiding place thou shalt preserve me from trouble 
thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance selah 
i will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt 
go i will guide thee with mine eye 
be ye not as the horse or as the mule which have no 
understanding whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle lest 
they come near unto thee 
many sorrows shall be to the wicked but he that trusteth in the 
lord mercy shall compass him about 
be glad in the lord and rejoice ye righteous and shout for 
joy all ye that are upright in heart 
rejoice in the lord o ye righteous for praise is comely for the 
upright 
praise the lord with harp sing unto him with the psaltery and an 
instrument of ten strings 
sing unto him a new song play skilfully with a loud noise 
for the word of the lord is right and all his works are done in 
truth 
he loveth righteousness and judgment the earth is full of the 
goodness of the lord 
by the word of the lord were the heavens made and all the host 
of them by the breath of his mouth 
he gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap he layeth 
up the depth in storehouses 
let all the earth fear the lord let all the inhabitants of the 
world stand in awe of him 
for he spake and it was done he commanded and it stood fast 
the lord bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought he 
maketh the devices of the people of none effect 
the counsel of the lord standeth for ever the thoughts of his 
heart to all generations 
blessed is the nation whose god is the lord and the people whom 
he hath chosen for his own inheritance 
the lord looketh from heaven he beholdeth all the sons of men 
from the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the 
inhabitants of the earth 
he fashioneth their hearts alike he considereth all their 
works 
there is no king saved by the multitude of an host a mighty man 
is not delivered by much strength 
an horse is a vain thing for safety neither shall he deliver 
any by his great strength 
behold the eye of the lord is upon them that fear him upon 
them that hope in his mercy 
to deliver their soul from death and to keep them alive in 
famine 
our soul waiteth for the lord he is our help and our shield 
for our heart shall rejoice in him because we have trusted in 
his holy name 
let thy mercy o lord be upon us according as we hope in thee 
i will bless the lord at all times his praise shall continually 
be in my mouth 
my soul shall make her boast in the lord the humble shall hear 
thereof and be glad 
o magnify the lord with me and let us exalt his name together 
i sought the lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my 
fears 
they looked unto him and were lightened and their faces were 
not ashamed 
this poor man cried and the lord heard him and saved him out of 
all his troubles 
the angel of the lord encampeth round about them that fear him 
and delivereth them 
o taste and see that the lord is good blessed is the man that 
trusteth in him 
o fear the lord ye his saints for there is no want to them that 
fear him 
the young lions do lack and suffer hunger but they that seek 
the lord shall not want any good thing 
come ye children hearken unto me i will teach you the fear of 
the lord 
what man is he that desireth life and loveth many days that he 
may see good 
keep thy tongue from evil and thy lips from speaking guile 
depart from evil and do good seek peace and pursue it 
the eyes of the lord are upon the righteous and his ears are 
open unto their cry 
the face of the lord is against them that do evil to cut off 
the remembrance of them from the earth 
the righteous cry and the lord heareth and delivereth them out 
of all their troubles 
the lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart and 
saveth such as be of a contrite spirit 
many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord 
delivereth him out of them all 
he keepeth all his bones not one of them is broken 
evil shall slay the wicked and they that hate the righteous 
shall be desolate 
the lord redeemeth the soul of his servants and none of them 
that trust in him shall be desolate 
plead my because o lord with them that strive with me fight 
against them that fight against me 
take hold of shield and buckler and stand up for mine help 
draw out also the spear and stop the way against them that 
persecute me say unto my soul i am thy salvation 
let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul 
let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt 
let them be as chaff before the wind and let the angel of the 
lord chase them 
let their way be dark and slippery and let the angel of the lord 
persecute them 
for without because have they hid for me their net in a pit which 
without because they have digged for my soul 
let destruction come upon him at unawares and let his net that 
he hath hid catch himself into that very destruction let him fall 
and my soul shall be joyful in the lord it shall rejoice in his 
salvation 
all my bones shall say lord who is like unto thee which 
deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him yea the poor 
and the needy from him that spoileth him 
false witnesses did rise up they laid to my charge things that 
i knew not 
they rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul 
but as for me when they were sick my clothing was sackcloth i 
humbled my soul with fasting and my prayer returned into mine own 
bosom 
i behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother i 
bowed down heavily as one that mourneth for his mother 
but in mine adversity they rejoiced and gathered themselves 
together yea the abjects gathered themselves together against me 
and i knew it not they did tear me and ceased not 
with hypocritical mockers in feasts they gnashed upon me with 
their teeth 
lord how long wilt thou look on rescue my soul from their 
destructions my darling from the lions 
i will give thee thanks in the great congregation i will praise 
thee among much people 
let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me 
neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a because 
for they speak not peace but they devise deceitful matters 
against them that are quiet in the land 
yea they opened their mouth wide against me and said aha 
aha our eye hath seen it 
this thou hast seen o lord keep not silence o lord be not 
far from me 
stir up thyself and awake to my judgment even unto my because 
my god and my lord 
judge me o lord my god according to thy righteousness and let 
them not rejoice over me 
let them not say in their hearts ah so would we have it let 
them not say we have swallowed him up 
let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that 
rejoice at mine hurt let them be clothed with shame and dishonour 
that magnify themselves against me 
let them shout for joy and be glad that favour my righteous 
because yea let them say continually let the lord be magnified which 
hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant 
and my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise 
all the day long 
the transgression of the wicked saith within my heart that there 
is no fear of god before his eyes 
for he flattereth himself in his own eyes until his iniquity be 
found to be hateful 
the words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit he hath left off 
to be wise and to do good 
he deviseth mischief upon his bed he setteth himself in a way 
that is not good he abhorreth not evil 
thy mercy o lord is in the heavens and thy faithfulness 
reacheth unto the clouds 
thy righteousness is like the great mountains thy judgments are 
a great deep o lord thou preservest man and beast 
how excellent is thy lovingkindness o god therefore the 
children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings 
they shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house 
and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures 
for with thee is the fountain of life in thy light shall we see 
light 
o continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee and thy 
righteousness to the upright in heart 
let not the foot of pride come against me and let not the hand 
of the wicked remove me 
there are the workers of iniquity fallen they are cast down 
and shall not be able to rise 
fret not thyself because of evildoers neither be thou envious 
against the workers of iniquity 
for they shall soon be cut down like the grass and wither as the 
green herb 
trust in the lord and do good so shalt thou dwell in the land 
and verily thou shalt be fed 
delight thyself also in the lord and he shall give thee the 
desires of thine heart 
commit thy way unto the lord trust also in him and he shall 
bring it to pass 
and he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light and thy 
judgment as the noonday 
rest in the lord and wait patiently for him fret not thyself 
because of him who prospereth in his way because of the man who 
bringeth wicked devices to pass 
cease from anger and forsake wrath fret not thyself in any wise 
to do evil 
for evildoers shall be cut off but those that wait upon the 
lord they shall inherit the earth 
for yet a little while and the wicked shall not be yea thou 
shalt diligently consider his place and it shall not be 
but the meek shall inherit the earth and shall delight 
themselves in the abundance of peace 
the wicked plotteth against the just and gnasheth upon him with 
his teeth 
the lord shall laugh at him for he seeth that his day is 
coming 
the wicked have drawn out the sword and have bent their bow to 
cast down the poor and needy and to slay such as be of upright 
conversation 
their sword shall enter into their own heart and their bows 
shall be broken 
a little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of 
many wicked 
for the arms of the wicked shall be broken but the lord 
upholdeth the righteous 
the lord knoweth the days of the upright and their inheritance 
shall be for ever 
they shall not be ashamed in the evil time and in the days of 
famine they shall be satisfied 
but the wicked shall perish and the enemies of the lord shall 
be as the fat of lambs they shall consume into smoke shall they 
consume away 
the wicked borroweth and payeth not again but the righteous 
sheweth mercy and giveth 
for such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth and they 
that be cursed of him shall be cut off 
the steps of a good man are ordered by the lord and he 
delighteth in his way 
though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the lord 
upholdeth him with his hand 
i have been young and now am old yet have i not seen the 
righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread 
he is ever merciful and lendeth and his seed is blessed 
depart from evil and do good and dwell for evermore 
for the lord loveth judgment and forsaketh not his saints they 
are preserved for ever but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off 
the righteous shall inherit the land and dwell therein for 
ever 
the mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom and his tongue 
talketh of judgment 
the law of his god is in his heart none of his steps shall 
slide 
the wicked watcheth the righteous and seeketh to slay him 
the lord will not leave him in his hand nor condemn him when he 
is judged 
wait on the lord and keep his way and he shall exalt thee to 
inherit the land when the wicked are cut off thou shalt see it 
i have seen the wicked in great power and spreading himself 
like a green bay tree 
yet he passed away and lo he was not yea i sought him but 
he could not be found 
mark the perfect man and behold the upright for the end of 
that man is peace 
but the transgressors shall be destroyed together the end of 
the wicked shall be cut off 
but the salvation of the righteous is of the lord he is their 
strength in the time of trouble 
and the lord shall help them and deliver them he shall deliver 
them from the wicked and save them because they trust in him 
o lord rebuke me not in thy wrath neither chasten me in thy hot 
displeasure 
for thine arrows stick fast in me and thy hand presseth me sore 
there is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger neither 
is there any rest in my bones because of my sin 
for mine iniquities are gone over mine head as an heavy burden 
they are too heavy for me 
my wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness 
i am troubled i am bowed down greatly i go mourning all the day 
long 
for my loins are filled with a loathsome disease and there is no 
soundness in my flesh 
i am feeble and sore broken i have roared by reason of the 
disquietness of my heart 
lord all my desire is before thee and my groaning is not hid 
from thee 
my heart panteth my strength faileth me as for the light of 
mine eyes it also is gone from me 
my lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore and my 
kinsmen stand afar off 
they also that seek after my life lay snares for me and they 
that seek my hurt speak mischievous things and imagine deceits all 
the day long 
but i as a deaf man heard not and i was as a dumb man that 
openeth not his mouth 
thus i was as a man that heareth not and in whose mouth are no 
reproofs 
for in thee o lord do i hope thou wilt hear o lord my god 
for i said hear me lest otherwise they should rejoice over me 
when my foot slippeth they magnify themselves against me 
for i am ready to halt and my sorrow is continually before me 
for i will declare mine iniquity i will be sorry for my sin 
but mine enemies are lively and they are strong and they that 
hate me wrongfully are multiplied 
they also that render evil for good are mine adversaries 
because i follow the thing that good is 
forsake me not o lord o my god be not far from me 
make haste to help me o lord my salvation 
i said i will take heed to my ways that i sin not with my 
tongue i will keep my mouth with a bridle while the wicked is before 
me 
i was dumb with silence i held my peace even from good and my 
sorrow was stirred 
my heart was hot within me while i was musing the fire burned 
then spake i with my tongue 
lord make me to know mine end and the measure of my days what 
it is that i may know how frail i am 
behold thou hast made my days as an handbreadth and mine age is 
as nothing before thee verily every man at his best state is 
altogether vanity 
selah 
surely every man walketh in a vain shew surely they are 
disquieted in vain he heapeth up riches and knoweth not who shall 
gather them 
and now lord what wait i for my hope is in thee 
deliver me from all my transgressions make me not the reproach 
of the foolish 
i was dumb i opened not my mouth because thou didst it 
remove thy stroke away from me i am consumed by the blow of 
thine hand 
when thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity thou 
makest his beauty to consume away like a moth surely every man is 
vanity selah 
hear my prayer o lord and give ear unto my cry hold not thy 
peace at my tears for i am a stranger with thee and a sojourner as 
all my fathers were 
o spare me that i may recover strength before i go hence and 
be no more 
i waited patiently for the lord and he inclined unto me and 
heard my cry 
he brought me up also out of an horrible pit out of the miry 
clay and set my feet upon a rock and established my goings 
and he hath put a new song in my mouth even praise unto our god 
many shall see it and fear and shall trust in the lord 
blessed is that man that maketh the lord his trust and 
respecteth not the proud nor such as turn aside to lies 
many o lord my god are thy wonderful works which thou hast 
done and thy thoughts which are to us ward they cannot be reckoned 
up in order unto thee if i would declare and speak of them they are 
more than can be numbered 
sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire mine ears hast thou 
opened burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required 
then said i lo i come in the volume of the book it is written 
of me 
i delight to do thy will o my god yea thy law is within my 
heart 
i have preached righteousness in the great congregation lo i 
have not refrained my lips o lord thou knowest 
i have not hid thy righteousness within my heart i have 
declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation i have not concealed thy 
lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation 
withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me o lord let thy 
lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me 
for innumerable evils have compassed me about mine iniquities 
have taken hold upon me so that i am not able to look up they are 
more than the hairs of mine head therefore my heart faileth me 
be pleased o lord to deliver me o lord make haste to help 
me 
let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my 
soul to destroy it let them be driven backward and put to shame that 
wish me evil 
let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto 
me aha aha 
let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee let 
such as love thy salvation say continually the lord be magnified 
but i am poor and needy yet the lord thinketh upon me thou art 
my help and my deliverer make no tarrying o my god 
blessed is he that considereth the poor the lord will deliver 
him in time of trouble 
the lord will preserve him and keep him alive and he shall be 
blessed upon the earth and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of 
his enemies 
the lord will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing thou 
wilt make all his bed in his sickness 
i said lord be merciful unto me heal my soul for i have 
sinned against thee 
mine enemies speak evil of me when shall he die and his name 
perish 
and if he come to see me he speaketh vanity his heart gathereth 
iniquity to itself when he goeth abroad he telleth it 
all that hate me whisper together against me against me do they 
devise my hurt 
an evil disease say they cleaveth fast unto him and now that 
he lieth he shall rise up no more 
yea mine own familiar friend in whom i trusted which did eat 
of my bread hath lifted up his heel against me 
but thou o lord be merciful unto me and raise me up that i 
may requite them 
by this i know that thou favourest me because mine enemy doth 
not triumph over me 
and as for me thou upholdest me in mine integrity and settest 
me before thy face for ever 
blessed be the lord god of israel from everlasting and to 
everlasting amen and amen 
as the hart panteth after the water brooks so panteth my soul 
after thee o god 
my soul thirsteth for god for the living god when shall i come 
and appear before god 
my tears have been my meat day and night while they continually 
say unto me where is thy god 
when i remember these things i pour out my soul in me for i had 
gone with the multitude i went with them to the house of god with 
the voice of joy and praise with a multitude that kept holyday 
why art thou cast down o my soul and why art thou disquieted in 
me hope thou in god for i shall yet praise him for the help of his 
countenance 
o my god my soul is cast down within me therefore will i 
remember thee from the land of jordan and of the hermonites from the 
hill mizar 
deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts all thy 
waves and thy billows are gone over me 
yet the lord will command his lovingkindness in the day time and 
in the night his song shall be with me and my prayer unto the god of 
my life 
i will say unto god my rock why hast thou forgotten me why go i 
mourning because of the oppression of the enemy 
as with a sword in my bones mine enemies reproach me while 
they say daily unto me where is thy god 
why art thou cast down o my soul and why art thou disquieted 
within me hope thou in god for i shall yet praise him who is the 
health of my countenance and my god 
judge me o god and plead my because against an ungodly nation o 
deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man 
for thou art the god of my strength why dost thou cast me off 
why go i mourning because of the oppression of the enemy 
o send out thy light and thy truth let them lead me let them 
bring me unto thy holy hill and to thy tabernacles 
then will i go unto the altar of god unto god my exceeding joy 
yea upon the harp will i praise thee o god my god 
why art thou cast down o my soul and why art thou disquieted 
within me hope in god for i shall yet praise him who is the health 
of my countenance and my god 
we have heard with our ears o god our fathers have told us 
what work thou didst in their days in the times of old 
how thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand and plantedst 
them how thou didst afflict the people and cast them out 
for they got not the land in possession by their own sword 
neither did their own arm save them but thy right hand and thine 
arm and the light of thy countenance because thou hadst a favour 
unto them 
thou art my king o god command deliverances for jacob 
through thee will we push down our enemies through thy name will 
we tread them under that rise up against us 
for i will not trust in my bow neither shall my sword save me 
but thou hast saved us from our enemies and hast put them to 
shame that hated us 
in god we boast all the day long and praise thy name for ever 
selah 
but thou hast cast off and put us to shame and goest not forth 
with our armies 
thou makest us to turn back from the enemy and they which hate 
us spoil for themselves 
thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat and hast 
scattered us among the heathen 
thou sellest thy people for nought and dost not increase thy 
wealth by their price 
thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours a scorn and a 
derision to them that are round about us 
thou makest us a byword among the heathen a shaking of the head 
among the people 
my confusion is continually before me and the shame of my face 
hath covered me 
for the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth by reason 
of the enemy and avenger 
all this is come upon us yet have we not forgotten thee 
neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant 
our heart is not turned back neither have our steps declined 
from thy way 
though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons and 
covered us with the shadow of death 
if we have forgotten the name of our god or stretched out our 
hands to a strange god 
shall not god search this out for he knoweth the secrets of the 
heart 
yea for thy sake are we killed all the day long we are counted 
as sheep for the slaughter 
awake why sleepest thou o lord arise cast us not off for 
ever 
wherefore hidest thou thy face and forgettest our affliction 
and our oppression 
for our soul is bowed down to the dust our belly cleaveth unto 
the earth 
arise for our help and redeem us for thy mercies sake 
my heart is inditing a good matter i speak of the things which i 
have made touching the king my tongue is the pen of a ready writer 
thou art fairer than the children of men grace is poured into 
thy lips therefore god hath blessed thee for ever 
gird thy sword upon thy thigh o most mighty with thy glory and 
thy majesty 
and in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and 
meekness and righteousness and thy right hand shall teach thee 
terrible things 
thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king s enemies 
whereby the people fall under thee 
thy throne o god is for ever and ever the sceptre of thy 
kingdom is a right sceptre 
thou lovest righteousness and hatest wickedness therefore god 
thy god hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy 
fellows 
all thy garments smell of myrrh and aloes and cassia out of 
the ivory palaces whereby they have made thee glad 
kings daughters were among thy honourable women upon thy right 
hand did stand the queen in gold of ophir 
hearken o daughter and consider and incline thine ear forget 
also thine own people and thy father s house 
so shall the king greatly desire thy beauty for he is thy lord 
and worship thou him 
and the daughter of tyre shall be there with a gift even the 
rich among the people shall intreat thy favour 
the king s daughter is all glorious within her clothing is of 
wrought gold 
she shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework the 
virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee 
with gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought they shall 
enter into the king s palace 
instead of thy fathers shall be thy children whom thou mayest 
make princes in all the earth 
i will make thy name to be remembered in all generations 
therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever 
god is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble 
therefore will not we fear though the earth be removed and 
though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea 
though the waters thereof roar and be troubled though the 
mountains shake with the swelling thereof selah 
there is a river the streams whereof shall make glad the city of 
god the holy place of the tabernacles of the most high 
god is in the midst of her she shall not be moved god shall 
help her and that right early 
the heathen raged the kingdoms were moved he uttered his voice 
the earth melted 
the lord of hosts is with us the god of jacob is our refuge 
selah 
come behold the works of the lord what desolations he hath made 
in the earth 
he maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth he breaketh 
the bow and cutteth the spear in sunder he burneth the chariot in 
the fire 
be still and know that i am god i will be exalted among the 
heathen i will be exalted in the earth 
the lord of hosts is with us the god of jacob is our refuge 
selah 
o clap your hands all ye people shout unto god with the voice 
of triumph 
for the lord most high is terrible he is a great king over all 
the earth 
he shall subdue the people under us and the nations under our 
feet 
he shall choose our inheritance for us the excellency of jacob 
whom he loved selah 
god is gone up with a shout the lord with the sound of a 
trumpet 
sing praises to god sing praises sing praises unto our king 
sing praises 
for god is the king of all the earth sing ye praises with 
understanding 
god reigneth over the heathen god sitteth upon the throne of his 
holiness 
the princes of the people are gathered together even the people 
of the god of abraham for the shields of the earth belong unto god 
he is greatly exalted 
great is the lord and greatly to be praised in the city of our 
god in the mountain of his holiness 
beautiful for situation the joy of the whole earth is mount 
zion on the sides of the north the city of the great king 
god is known in her palaces for a refuge 
for lo the kings were assembled they passed by together 
they saw it and so they marvelled they were troubled and 
hasted away 
fear took hold upon them there and pain as of a woman in 
travail 
thou breakest the ships of tarshish with an east wind 
as we have heard so have we seen in the city of the lord of 
hosts in the city of our god god will establish it for ever selah 
we have thought of thy lovingkindness o god in the midst of thy 
temple 
according to thy name o god so is thy praise unto the ends of 
the earth thy right hand is full of righteousness 
let mount zion rejoice let the daughters of judah be glad 
because of thy judgments 
walk about zion and go round about her tell the towers 
thereof 
mark ye well her bulwarks consider her palaces that ye may 
tell it to the generation following 
for this god is our god for ever and ever he will be our guide 
even unto death 
hear this all ye people give ear all ye inhabitants of the 
world 
both low and high rich and poor together 
my mouth shall speak of wisdom and the meditation of my heart 
shall be of understanding 
i will incline mine ear to a parable i will open my dark saying 
upon the harp 
wherefore should i fear in the days of evil when the iniquity of 
my heels shall compass me about 
they that trust in their wealth and boast themselves in the 
multitude of their riches 
none of them can by any means redeem his brother nor give to god 
a ransom for him 
for the redemption of their soul is precious and it ceaseth for 
ever 
that he should still live for ever and not see corruption 
for he seeth that wise men die likewise the fool and the 
brutish person perish and leave their wealth to others 
their inward thought is that their houses shall continue for 
ever and their dwelling places to all generations they call their 
lands after their own names 
nevertheless man being in honour abideth not he is like the 
beasts that perish 
this their way is their folly yet their posterity approve their 
sayings selah 
like sheep they are laid in the grave death shall feed on them 
and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning and 
their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling 
but god will redeem my soul from the power of the grave for he 
shall receive me selah 
be not thou afraid when one is made rich when the glory of his 
house is increased 
for when he dieth he shall carry nothing away his glory shall 
not descend after him 
though while he lived he blessed his soul and men will praise 
thee when thou doest well to thyself 
he shall go to the generation of his fathers they shall never 
see light 
man that is in honour and understandeth not is like the beasts 
that perish 
the mighty god even the lord hath spoken and called the earth 
from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof 
out of zion the perfection of beauty god hath shined 
our god shall come and shall not keep silence a fire shall 
devour before him and it shall be very tempestuous round about him 
he shall call to the heavens from above and to the earth that 
he may judge his people 
gather my saints together unto me those that have made a 
covenant with me by sacrifice 
and the heavens shall declare his righteousness for god is judge 
himself selah 
hear o my people and i will speak o israel and i will testify 
against thee i am god even thy god 
i will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt 
offerings to have been continually before me 
i will take no bullock out of thy house nor he goats out of thy 
folds 
for every beast of the forest is mine and the cattle upon a 
thousand hills 
i know all the fowls of the mountains and the wild beasts of 
the field are mine 
if i were hungry i would not tell thee for the world is mine 
and the fulness thereof 
will i eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats 
offer unto god thanksgiving and pay thy vows unto the most 
high 
and call upon me in the day of trouble i will deliver thee and 
thou shalt glorify me 
but unto the wicked god saith what hast thou to do to declare 
my statutes or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth 
seeing thou hatest instruction and casteth my words behind 
thee 
when thou sawest a thief then thou consentedst with him and 
hast been partaker with adulterers 
thou givest thy mouth to evil and thy tongue frameth deceit 
thou sittest and speakest against thy brother thou slanderest 
thine own mother s son 
these things hast thou done and i kept silence thou thoughtest 
that i was altogether such an one as thyself but i will reprove thee 
and set them in order before thine eyes 
now consider this ye that forget god lest i tear you in 
pieces and there be none to deliver 
whoso offereth praise glorifieth me and to him that ordereth 
his conversation aright will i shew the salvation of god 
have mercy upon me o god according to thy lovingkindness 
according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my 
transgressions 
wash me throughly from mine iniquity and cleanse me from my sin 
for i acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before 
me 
against thee thee only have i sinned and done this evil in thy 
sight that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest and be 
clear when thou judgest 
behold i was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother 
conceive me 
behold thou desirest truth in the inward parts and in the 
hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom 
purge me with hyssop and i shall be clean wash me and i shall 
be whiter than snow 
make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou hast 
broken may rejoice 
hide thy face from my sins and blot out all mine iniquities 
create in me a clean heart o god and renew a right spirit 
within me 
cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy holy spirit 
from me 
restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy 
free spirit 
then will i teach transgressors thy ways and sinners shall be 
converted unto thee 
deliver me from bloodguiltiness o god thou god of my 
salvation and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness 
o lord open thou my lips and my mouth shall shew forth thy 
praise 
for thou desirest not sacrifice else would i give it thou 
delightest not in burnt offering 
the sacrifices of god are a broken spirit a broken and a 
contrite heart o god thou wilt not despise 
do good in thy good pleasure unto zion build thou the walls of 
jerusalem 
then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness 
with burnt offering and whole burnt offering then shall they offer 
bullocks upon thine altar 
why boastest thou thyself in mischief o mighty man the goodness 
of god endureth continually 
the tongue deviseth mischiefs like a sharp razor working 
deceitfully 
thou lovest evil more than good and lying rather than to speak 
righteousness selah 
thou lovest all devouring words o thou deceitful tongue 
god shall likewise destroy thee for ever he shall take thee 
away and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place and root thee out of 
the land of the living selah 
the righteous also shall see and fear and shall laugh at him 
lo this is the man that made not god his strength but trusted 
in the abundance of his riches and strengthened himself in his 
wickedness 
but i am like a green olive tree in the house of god i trust in 
the mercy of god for ever and ever 
i will praise thee for ever because thou hast done it and i 
will wait on thy name for it is good before thy saints 
the fool hath said in his heart there is no god corrupt are 
they and have done abominable iniquity there is none that doeth 
good 
god looked down from heaven upon the children of men to see if 
there were any that did understand that did seek god 
every one of them is gone back they are altogether become 
filthy there is none that doeth good no not one 
have the workers of iniquity no knowledge who eat up my people 
as they eat bread they have not called upon god 
there were they in great fear where no fear was for god hath 
scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee thou hast put 
them to shame because god hath despised them 
oh that the salvation of israel were come out of zion when god 
bringeth back the captivity of his people jacob shall rejoice and 
israel shall be glad 
save me o god by thy name and judge me by thy strength 
hear my prayer o god give ear to the words of my mouth 
for strangers are risen up against me and oppressors seek after 
my soul they have not set god before them selah 
behold god is mine helper the lord is with them that uphold my 
soul 
he shall reward evil unto mine enemies cut them off in thy 
truth 
i will freely sacrifice unto thee i will praise thy name o 
lord for it is good 
for he hath delivered me out of all trouble and mine eye hath 
seen his desire upon mine enemies 
give ear to my prayer o god and hide not thyself from my 
supplication 
attend unto me and hear me i mourn in my complaint and make a 
noise 
because of the voice of the enemy because of the oppression of 
the wicked for they cast iniquity upon me and in wrath they hate me 
my heart is sore pained within me and the terrors of death are 
fallen upon me 
fearfulness and trembling are come upon me and horror hath 
overwhelmed me 
and i said oh that i had wings like a dove for then would i fly 
away and be at rest 
lo then would i wander far off and remain in the wilderness 
selah 
i would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest 
destroy o lord and divide their tongues for i have seen 
violence and strife in the city 
day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof mischief 
also and sorrow are in the midst of it 
wickedness is in the midst thereof deceit and guile depart not 
from her streets 
for it was not an enemy that reproached me then i could have 
borne it neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself 
against me then i would have hid myself from him 
but it was thou a man mine equal my guide and mine 
acquaintance 
we took sweet counsel together and walked unto the house of god 
in company 
let death seize upon them and let them go down quick into hell 
for wickedness is in their dwellings and among them 
as for me i will call upon god and the lord shall save me 
evening and morning and at noon will i pray and cry aloud 
and he shall hear my voice 
he hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was 
against me for there were many with me 
god shall hear and afflict them even he that abideth of old 
selah because they have no changes therefore they fear not god 
he hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with 
him he hath broken his covenant 
the words of his mouth were smoother than butter but war was in 
his heart his words were softer than oil yet were they drawn swords 
cast thy burden upon the lord and he shall sustain thee he 
shall never suffer the righteous to be moved 
but thou o god shalt bring them down into the pit of 
destruction bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their 
days but i will trust in thee 
be merciful unto me o god for man would swallow me up he 
fighting daily oppresseth me 
mine enemies would daily swallow me up for they be many that 
fight against me o thou most high 
what time i am afraid i will trust in thee 
in god i will praise his word in god i have put my trust i will 
not fear what flesh can do unto me 
every day they wrest my words all their thoughts are against me 
for evil 
they gather themselves together they hide themselves they mark 
my steps when they wait for my soul 
shall they escape by iniquity in thine anger cast down the 
people o god 
thou tellest my wanderings put thou my tears into thy bottle 
are they not in thy book 
when i cry unto thee then shall mine enemies turn back this i 
know for god is for me 
in god will i praise his word in the lord will i praise his 
word 
in god have i put my trust i will not be afraid what man can do 
unto me 
thy vows are upon me o god i will render praises unto thee 
for thou hast delivered my soul from death wilt not thou 
deliver my feet from falling that i may walk before god in the light 
of the living 
be merciful unto me o god be merciful unto me for my soul 
trusteth in thee yea in the shadow of thy wings will i make my 
refuge until these calamities be overpast 
i will cry unto god most high unto god that performeth all 
things for me 
he shall send from heaven and save me from the reproach of him 
that would swallow me up selah god shall send forth his mercy and 
his truth 
my soul is among lions and i lie even among them that are set on 
fire even the sons of men whose teeth are spears and arrows and 
their tongue a sharp sword 
be thou exalted o god above the heavens let thy glory be above 
all the earth 
they have prepared a net for my steps my soul is bowed down 
they have digged a pit before me into the midst whereof they are 
fallen themselves selah 
my heart is fixed o god my heart is fixed i will sing and give 
praise 
awake up my glory awake psaltery and harp i myself will awake 
early 
i will praise thee o lord among the people i will sing unto 
thee among the nations 
for thy mercy is great unto the heavens and thy truth unto the 
clouds 
be thou exalted o god above the heavens let thy glory be 
above all the earth 
do ye indeed speak righteousness o congregation do ye judge 
uprightly o ye sons of men 
yea in heart ye work wickedness ye weigh the violence of your 
hands in the earth 
the wicked are estranged from the womb they go astray as soon as 
they be born speaking lies 
their poison is like the poison of a serpent they are like the 
deaf adder that stoppeth her ear 
which will not hearken to the voice of charmers charming never 
so wisely 
break their teeth o god in their mouth break out the great 
teeth of the young lions o lord 
let them melt away as waters which run continually when he 
bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows let them be as cut in pieces 
as a snail which melteth let every one of them pass away like 
the untimely birth of a woman that they may not see the sun 
before your pots can feel the thorns he shall take them away as 
with a whirlwind both living and in his wrath 
the righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance he 
shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked 
so that a man shall say verily there is a reward for the 
righteous verily he is a god that judgeth in the earth 
deliver me from mine enemies o my god defend me from them that 
rise up against me 
deliver me from the workers of iniquity and save me from bloody 
men 
for lo they lie in wait for my soul the mighty are gathered 
against me not for my transgression nor for my sin o lord 
they run and prepare themselves without my fault awake to help 
me and behold 
thou therefore o lord god of hosts the god of israel awake to 
visit all the heathen be not merciful to any wicked transgressors 
selah 
they return at evening they make a noise like a dog and go 
round about the city 
behold they belch out with their mouth swords are in their 
lips for who say they doth hear 
but thou o lord shalt laugh at them thou shalt have all the 
heathen in derision 
because of his strength will i wait upon thee for god is my 
defence 
the god of my mercy shall prevent me god shall let me see my 
desire upon mine enemies 
slay them not lest my people forget scatter them by thy power 
and bring them down o lord our shield 
for the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them 
even be taken in their pride and for cursing and lying which they 
speak 
consume them in wrath consume them that they may not be and 
let them know that god ruleth in jacob unto the ends of the earth 
selah 
and at evening let them return and let them make a noise like a 
dog and go round about the city 
let them wander up and down for meat and grudge if they be not 
satisfied 
but i will sing of thy power yea i will sing aloud of thy 
mercy in the morning for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the 
day of my trouble 
unto thee o my strength will i sing for god is my defence 
and the god of my mercy 
o god thou hast cast us off thou hast scattered us thou hast 
been displeased o turn thyself to us again 
thou hast made the earth to tremble thou hast broken it heal 
the breaches thereof for it shaketh 
thou hast shewed thy people hard things thou hast made us to 
drink the wine of astonishment 
thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee that it may be 
displayed because of the truth selah 
that thy beloved may be delivered save with thy right hand and 
hear me 
god hath spoken in his holiness i will rejoice i will divide 
shechem and mete out the valley of succoth 
gilead is mine and manasseh is mine ephraim also is the 
strength of mine head judah is my lawgiver 
moab is my washpot over edom will i cast out my shoe philistia 
triumph thou because of me 
who will bring me into the strong city who will lead me into 
edom 
wilt not thou o god which hadst cast us off and thou o god 
which didst not go out with our armies 
give us help from trouble for vain is the help of man 
through god we shall do valiantly for he it is that shall tread 
down our enemies 
hear my cry o god attend unto my prayer 
from the end of the earth will i cry unto thee when my heart is 
overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than i 
for thou hast been a shelter for me and a strong tower from the 
enemy 
i will abide in thy tabernacle for ever i will trust in the 
covert of thy wings selah 
for thou o god hast heard my vows thou hast given me the 
heritage of those that fear thy name 
thou wilt prolong the king s life and his years as many 
generations 
he shall abide before god for ever o prepare mercy and truth 
which may preserve him 
so will i sing praise unto thy name for ever that i may daily 
perform my vows 
truly my soul waiteth upon god from him cometh my salvation 
he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defence i shall 
not be greatly moved 
how long will ye imagine mischief against a man ye shall be 
slain all of you as a bowing wall shall ye be and as a tottering 
fence 
they only consult to cast him down from his excellency they 
delight in lies they bless with their mouth but they curse inwardly 
selah 
my soul wait thou only upon god for my expectation is from him 
he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defence i shall 
not be moved 
in god is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and 
my refuge is in god 
trust in him at all times ye people pour out your heart before 
him god is a refuge for us selah 
surely men of low degree are vanity and men of high degree are a 
lie to be laid in the balance they are altogether lighter than 
vanity 
trust not in oppression and become not vain in robbery if 
riches increase set not your heart upon them 
god hath spoken once twice have i heard this that power 
belongeth unto god 
also unto thee o lord belongeth mercy for thou renderest to 
every man according to his work 
o god thou art my god early will i seek thee my soul thirsteth 
for thee my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land where 
no water is 
to see thy power and thy glory so as i have seen thee in the 
sanctuary 
because thy lovingkindness is better than life my lips shall 
praise thee 
thus will i bless thee while i live i will lift up my hands in 
thy name 
my soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness and my 
mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips 
when i remember thee upon my bed and meditate on thee in the 
night watches 
because thou hast been my help therefore in the shadow of thy 
wings will i rejoice 
my soul followeth hard after thee thy right hand upholdeth me 
but those that seek my soul to destroy it shall go into the 
lower parts of the earth 
they shall fall by the sword they shall be a portion for foxes 
but the king shall rejoice in god every one that sweareth by 
him shall glory but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be 
stopped 
hear my voice o god in my prayer preserve my life from fear of 
the enemy 
hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked from the 
insurrection of the workers of iniquity 
who whet their tongue like a sword and bend their bows to shoot 
their arrows even bitter words 
that they may shoot in secret at the perfect suddenly do they 
shoot at him and fear not 
they encourage themselves in an evil matter they commune of 
laying snares privily they say who shall see them 
they search out iniquities they accomplish a diligent search 
both the inward thought of every one of them and the heart is deep 
but god shall shoot at them with an arrow suddenly shall they be 
wounded 
so they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves all 
that see them shall flee away 
and all men shall fear and shall declare the work of god for 
they shall wisely consider of his doing 
the righteous shall be glad in the lord and shall trust in him 
and all the upright in heart shall glory 
praise waiteth for thee o god in sion and unto thee shall the 
vow be performed 
o thou that hearest prayer unto thee shall all flesh come 
iniquities prevail against me as for our transgressions thou 
shalt purge them away 
blessed is the man whom thou choosest and causest to approach 
unto thee that he may dwell in thy courts we shall be satisfied with 
the goodness of thy house even of thy holy temple 
by terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us o god of 
our salvation who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth 
and of them that are afar off upon the sea 
which by his strength setteth fast the mountains being girded 
with power 
which stilleth the noise of the seas the noise of their waves 
and the tumult of the people 
they also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy 
tokens thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to 
rejoice 
thou visitest the earth and waterest it thou greatly enrichest 
it with the river of god which is full of water thou preparest them 
corn when thou hast so provided for it 
thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly thou settlest the 
furrows thereof thou makest it soft with showers thou blessest the 
springing thereof 
thou crownest the year with thy goodness and thy paths drop 
fatness 
they drop upon the pastures of the wilderness and the little 
hills rejoice on every side 
the pastures are clothed with flocks the valleys also are 
covered over with corn they shout for joy they also sing 
make a joyful noise unto god all ye lands 
sing forth the honour of his name make his praise glorious 
say unto god how terrible art thou in thy works through the 
greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto 
thee 
all the earth shall worship thee and shall sing unto thee they 
shall sing to thy name selah 
come and see the works of god he is terrible in his doing toward 
the children of men 
he turned the sea into dry land they went through the flood on 
foot there did we rejoice in him 
he ruleth by his power for ever his eyes behold the nations let 
not the rebellious exalt themselves selah 
o bless our god ye people and make the voice of his praise to 
be heard 
which holdeth our soul in life and suffereth not our feet to be 
moved 
for thou o god hast proved us thou hast tried us as silver 
is tried 
thou broughtest us into the net thou laidst affliction upon our 
loins 
thou hast caused men to ride over our heads we went through 
fire and through water but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy 
place 
i will go into thy house with burnt offerings i will pay thee 
my vows 
which my lips have uttered and my mouth hath spoken when i was 
in trouble 
i will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings with the 
incense of rams i will offer bullocks with goats selah 
come and hear all ye that fear god and i will declare what he 
hath done for my soul 
i cried unto him with my mouth and he was extolled with my 
tongue 
if i regard iniquity in my heart the lord will not hear me 
but verily god hath heard me he hath attended to the voice of 
my prayer 
blessed be god which hath not turned away my prayer nor his 
mercy from me 
god be merciful unto us and bless us and because his face to 
shine upon us selah 
that thy way may be known upon earth thy saving health among all 
nations

thee 
o let the nations be glad and sing for joy for thou shalt judge 
the people righteously and govern the nations upon earth selah 
let the people praise thee o god let all the people praise 
thee 
then shall the earth yield her increase and god even our own 
god shall bless us

hate him flee before him 
as smoke is driven away so drive them away as wax melteth 
before the fire so let the wicked perish at the presence of god

are bound with chains but the rebellious dwell in a dry land 
o god when thou wentest forth before thy people when thou didst 
march through the wilderness selah 
the earth shook the heavens also dropped at the presence of god 
even sinai itself was moved at the presence of god the god of israel 
thou o god didst send a plentiful rain whereby thou didst 
confirm thine inheritance when it was weary 
thy congregation hath dwelt therein thou o god hast prepared 
of thy goodness for the poor 
the lord gave the word great was the company of those that 
published it 
kings of armies did flee apace and she that tarried at home 
divided the spoil 
though ye have lien among the pots yet shall ye be as the wings 
of a dove covered with silver and her feathers with yellow gold 
when the almighty scattered kings in it it was white as snow in 
salmon 
the hill of god is as the hill of bashan an high hill as the 
hill of bashan 
why leap ye ye high hills this is the hill which god desireth 
to dwell in yea the lord will dwell in it for ever

angels the lord is among them as in sinai in the holy place 
thou hast ascended on high thou hast led captivity captive 
thou hast received gifts for men yea for the rebellious also that 
the lord god might dwell among them 
blessed be the lord who daily loadeth us with benefits even 
the god of our salvation selah

lord belong the issues from death 
but god shall wound the head of his enemies and the hairy scalp 
of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses 
the lord said i will bring again from bashan i will bring my 
people again from the depths of the sea 
that thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies and 
the tongue of thy dogs in the same 
they have seen thy goings o god even the goings of my god my 
king in the sanctuary 
the singers went before the players on instruments followed 
after among them were the damsels playing with timbrels 
bless ye god in the congregations even the lord from the 
fountain of israel 
there is little benjamin with their ruler the princes of judah 
and their council the princes of zebulun and the princes of 
naphtali

which thou hast wrought for us 
because of thy temple at jerusalem shall kings bring presents 
unto thee

the calves of the people till every one submit himself with pieces of 
silver scatter thou the people that delight in war 
princes shall come out of egypt ethiopia shall soon stretch out 
her hands unto god

lord selah 
to him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens which were of 
old lo he doth send out his voice and that a mighty voice 
ascribe ye strength unto god his excellency is over israel and 
his strength is in the clouds 
o god thou art terrible out of thy holy places the god of 
israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people blessed 
be god 
save me o god for the waters are come in unto my soul 
i sink in deep mire where there is no standing i am come into 
deep waters where the floods overflow me 
i am weary of my crying my throat is dried mine eyes fail while 
i wait for my god 
they that hate me without a because are more than the hairs of mine 
head they that would destroy me being mine enemies wrongfully are 
mighty then i restored that which i took not away 
o god thou knowest my foolishness and my sins are not hid from 
thee 
let not them that wait on thee o lord god of hosts be ashamed 
for my sake let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake o 
god of israel 
because for thy sake i have borne reproach shame hath covered my 
face 
i am become a stranger unto my brethren and an alien unto my 
mother s children 
for the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up and the reproaches 
of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me 
when i wept and chastened my soul with fasting that was to my 
reproach 
i made sackcloth also my garment and i became a proverb to 
them 
they that sit in the gate speak against me and i was the song 
of the drunkards 
but as for me my prayer is unto thee o lord in an acceptable 
time o god in the multitude of thy mercy hear me in the truth of 
thy salvation 
deliver me out of the mire and let me not sink let me be 
delivered from them that hate me and out of the deep waters 
let not the waterflood overflow me neither let the deep swallow 
me up and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me 
hear me o lord for thy lovingkindness is good turn unto me 
according to the multitude of thy tender mercies 
and hide not thy face from thy servant for i am in trouble 
hear me speedily 
draw nigh unto my soul and redeem it deliver me because of 
mine enemies 
thou hast known my reproach and my shame and my dishonour 
mine adversaries are all before thee 
reproach hath broken my heart and i am full of heaviness and i 
looked for some to take pity but there was none and for comforters 
but i found none 
they gave me also gall for my meat and in my thirst they gave 
me vinegar to drink 
let their table become a snare before them and that which 
should have been for their welfare let it become a trap 
let their eyes be darkened that they see not and make their 
loins continually to shake 
pour out thine indignation upon them and let thy wrathful anger 
take hold of them 
let their habitation be desolate and let none dwell in their 
tents 
for they persecute him whom thou hast smitten and they talk to 
the grief of those whom thou hast wounded 
add iniquity unto their iniquity and let them not come into thy 
righteousness 
let them be blotted out of the book of the living and not be 
written with the righteous 
but i am poor and sorrowful let thy salvation o god set me up 
on high 
i will praise the name of god with a song and will magnify him 
with thanksgiving 
this also shall please the lord better than an ox or bullock 
that hath horns and hoofs 
the humble shall see this and be glad and your heart shall 
live that seek god 
for the lord heareth the poor and despiseth not his prisoners 
let the heaven and earth praise him the seas and every thing 
that moveth therein 
for god will save zion and will build the cities of judah that 
they may dwell there and have it in possession 
the seed also of his servants shall inherit it and they that 
love his name shall dwell therein 
make haste o god to deliver me make haste to help me o lord 
let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul let 
them be turned backward and put to confusion that desire my hurt 
let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say 
aha aha 
let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee and let 
such as love thy salvation say continually let god be magnified 
but i am poor and needy make haste unto me o god thou art my 
help and my deliverer o lord make no tarrying 
in thee o lord do i put my trust let me never be put to 
confusion 
deliver me in thy righteousness and because me to escape incline 
thine ear unto me and save me 
be thou my strong habitation whereunto i may continually resort 
thou hast given commandment to save me for thou art my rock and my 
fortress 
deliver me o my god out of the hand of the wicked out of the 
hand of the unrighteous and cruel man 
for thou art my hope o lord god thou art my trust from my 
youth 
by thee have i been holden up from the womb thou art he that 
took me out of my mother s bowels my praise shall be continually of 
thee 
i am as a wonder unto many but thou art my strong refuge 
let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all 
the day 
cast me not off in the time of old age forsake me not when my 
strength faileth 
for mine enemies speak against me and they that lay wait for my 
soul take counsel together 
saying god hath forsaken him persecute and take him for there 
is none to deliver him 
o god be not far from me o my god make haste for my help 
let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my 
soul let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my 
hurt 
but i will hope continually and will yet praise thee more and 
more 
my mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation 
all the day for i know not the numbers thereof 
i will go in the strength of the lord god i will make mention 
of thy righteousness even of thine only 
o god thou hast taught me from my youth and hitherto have i 
declared thy wondrous works 
now also when i am old and greyheaded o god forsake me not 
until i have shewed thy strength unto this generation and thy power 
to every one that is to come 
thy righteousness also o god is very high who hast done great 
things o god who is like unto thee 
thou which hast shewed me great and sore troubles shalt 
quicken me again and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the 
earth 
thou shalt increase my greatness and comfort me on every side 
i will also praise thee with the psaltery even thy truth o my 
god unto thee will i sing with the harp o thou holy one of israel 
my lips shall greatly rejoice when i sing unto thee and my 
soul which thou hast redeemed 
my tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long 
for they are confounded for they are brought unto shame that seek my 
hurt 
give the king thy judgments o god and thy righteousness unto 
the king s son 
he shall judge thy people with righteousness and thy poor with 
judgment 
the mountains shall bring peace to the people and the little 
hills by righteousness 
he shall judge the poor of the people he shall save the children 
of the needy and shall break in pieces the oppressor 
they shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure 
throughout all generations 
he shall come down like rain upon the mown grass as showers that 
water the earth 
in his days shall the righteous flourish and abundance of peace 
so long as the moon endureth 
he shall have dominion also from sea to sea and from the river 
unto the ends of the earth 
they that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him and his 
enemies shall lick the dust 
the kings of tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents the 
kings of sheba and seba shall offer gifts 
yea all kings shall fall down before him all nations shall 
serve him 
for he shall deliver the needy when he crieth the poor also 
and him that hath no helper 
he shall spare the poor and needy and shall save the souls of 
the needy 
he shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence and 
precious shall their blood be in his sight 
and he shall live and to him shall be given of the gold of 
sheba prayer also shall be made for him continually and daily shall 
he be praised 
there shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of 
the mountains the fruit thereof shall shake like lebanon and they of 
the city shall flourish like grass of the earth 
his name shall endure for ever his name shall be continued as 
long as the sun and men shall be blessed in him all nations shall 
call him blessed 
blessed be the lord god the god of israel who only doeth 
wondrous things 
and blessed be his glorious name for ever and let the whole 
earth be filled with his glory amen and amen 
the prayers of david the son of jesse are ended 
truly god is good to israel even to such as are of a clean 
heart 
but as for me my feet were almost gone my steps had well nigh 
slipped 
for i was envious at the foolish when i saw the prosperity of 
the wicked 
for there are no bands in their death but their strength is 
firm 
they are not in trouble as other men neither are they plagued 
like other men 
therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain violence 
covereth them as a garment 
their eyes stand out with fatness they have more than heart 
could wish 
they are corrupt and speak wickedly concerning oppression they 
speak loftily 
they set their mouth against the heavens and their tongue 
walketh through the earth 
therefore his people return hither and waters of a full cup are 
wrung out to them 
and they say how doth god know and is there knowledge in the 
most high 
behold these are the ungodly who prosper in the world they 
increase in riches 
verily i have cleansed my heart in vain and washed my hands in 
innocency 
for all the day long have i been plagued and chastened every 
morning 
if i say i will speak thus behold i should offend against the 
generation of thy children 
when i thought to know this it was too painful for me 
until i went into the sanctuary of god then understood i their 
end 
surely thou didst set them in slippery places thou castedst 
them down into destruction 
how are they brought into desolation as in a moment they are 
utterly consumed with terrors 
as a dream when one awaketh so o lord when thou awakest thou 
shalt despise their image 
thus my heart was grieved and i was pricked in my reins 
so foolish was i and ignorant i was as a beast before thee 
nevertheless i am continually with thee thou hast holden me by 
my right hand 
thou shalt guide me with thy counsel and afterward receive me 
to glory 
whom have i in heaven but thee and there is none upon earth 
that i desire beside thee 
my flesh and my heart faileth but god is the strength of my 
heart and my portion for ever 
for lo they that are far from thee shall perish thou hast 
destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee 
but it is good for me to draw near to god i have put my trust 
in the lord god that i may declare all thy works 
o god why hast thou cast us off for ever why doth thine anger 
smoke against the sheep of thy pasture 
remember thy congregation which thou hast purchased of old the 
rod of thine inheritance which thou hast redeemed this mount zion 
wherein thou hast dwelt 
lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations even all that 
the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary 
thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations they set up 
their ensigns for signs 
a man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the 
thick trees 
but now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes 
and hammers 
they have cast fire into thy sanctuary they have defiled by 
casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground 
they said in their hearts let us destroy them together they 
have burned up all the synagogues of god in the land 
we see not our signs there is no more any prophet neither is 
there among us any that knoweth how long 
o god how long shall the adversary reproach shall the enemy 
blaspheme thy name for ever 
why withdrawest thou thy hand even thy right hand pluck it out 
of thy bosom 
for god is my king of old working salvation in the midst of the 
earth 
thou didst divide the sea by thy strength thou brakest the 
heads of the dragons in the waters 
thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces and gavest him to 
be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness 
thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood thou driedst up 
mighty rivers 
the day is thine the night also is thine thou hast prepared 
the light and the sun 
thou hast set all the borders of the earth thou hast made 
summer and winter 
remember this that the enemy hath reproached o lord and that 
the foolish people have blasphemed thy name 
o deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of 
the wicked forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever 
have respect unto the covenant for the dark places of the earth 
are full of the habitations of cruelty 
o let not the oppressed return ashamed let the poor and needy 
praise thy name 
arise o god plead thine own because remember how the foolish 
man reproacheth thee daily 
forget not the voice of thine enemies the tumult of those that 
rise up against thee increaseth continually 
unto thee o god do we give thanks unto thee do we give thanks 
for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare 
when i shall receive the congregation i will judge uprightly 
the earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved i bear 
up the pillars of it selah 
i said unto the fools deal not foolishly and to the wicked 
lift not up the horn 
lift not up your horn on high speak not with a stiff neck 
for promotion cometh neither from the east nor from the west 
nor from the south 
but god is the judge he putteth down one and setteth up 
another 
for in the hand of the lord there is a cup and the wine is red 
it is full of mixture and he poureth out of the same but the dregs 
thereof all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out and drink 
them 
but i will declare for ever i will sing praises to the god of 
jacob 
all the horns of the wicked also will i cut off but the horns 
of the righteous shall be exalted 
in judah is god known his name is great in israel 
in salem also is his tabernacle and his dwelling place in zion 
there brake he the arrows of the bow the shield and the sword 
and the battle selah 
thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey 
the stouthearted are spoiled they have slept their sleep and 
none of the men of might have found their hands 
at thy rebuke o god of jacob both the chariot and horse are 
cast into a dead sleep 
thou even thou art to be feared and who may stand in thy sight 
when once thou art angry 
thou didst because judgment to be heard from heaven the earth 
feared and was still 
when god arose to judgment to save all the meek of the earth 
selah 
surely the wrath of man shall praise thee the remainder of 
wrath shalt thou restrain 
vow and pay unto the lord your god let all that be round about 
him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared 
he shall cut off the spirit of princes he is terrible to the 
kings of the earth 
i cried unto god with my voice even unto god with my voice and 
he gave ear unto me 
in the day of my trouble i sought the lord my sore ran in the 
night and ceased not my soul refused to be comforted 
i remembered god and was troubled i complained and my spirit 
was overwhelmed selah 
thou holdest mine eyes waking i am so troubled that i cannot 
speak 
i have considered the days of old the years of ancient times 
i call to remembrance my song in the night i commune with mine 
own heart and my spirit made diligent search 
will the lord cast off for ever and will he be favourable no 
more 
is his mercy clean gone for ever doth his promise fail for 
evermore 
hath god forgotten to be gracious hath he in anger shut up his 
tender mercies selah 
and i said this is my infirmity but i will remember the years 
of the right hand of the most high 
i will remember the works of the lord surely i will remember 
thy wonders of old 
i will meditate also of all thy work and talk of thy doings 
thy way o god is in the sanctuary who is so great a god as 
our god 
thou art the god that doest wonders thou hast declared thy 
strength among the people 
thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people the sons of jacob 
and joseph selah 
the waters saw thee o god the waters saw thee they were 
afraid the depths also were troubled 
the clouds poured out water the skies sent out a sound thine 
arrows also went abroad 
the voice of thy thunder was in the heaven the lightnings 
lightened the world the earth trembled and shook 
thy way is in the sea and thy path in the great waters and thy 
footsteps are not known 
thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of moses and 
aaron 
give ear o my people to my law incline your ears to the words 
of my mouth 
i will open my mouth in a parable i will utter dark sayings of 
old 
which we have heard and known and our fathers have told us 
we will not hide them from their children shewing to the 
generation to come the praises of the lord and his strength and his 
wonderful works that he hath done 
for he established a testimony in jacob and appointed a law in 
israel which he commanded our fathers that they should make them 
known to their children 
that the generation to come might know them even the children 
which should be born who should arise and declare them to their 
children 
that they might set their hope in god and not forget the works 
of god but keep his commandments 
and might not be as their fathers a stubborn and rebellious 
generation a generation that set not their heart aright and whose 
spirit was not stedfast with god 
the children of ephraim being armed and carrying bows turned 
back in the day of battle 
they kept not the covenant of god and refused to walk in his 
law 
and forgat his works and his wonders that he had shewed them 
marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers in the 
land of egypt in the field of zoan 
he divided the sea and caused them to pass through and he made 
the waters to stand as an heap 
in the daytime also he led them with a cloud and all the night 
with a light of fire 
he clave the rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink as out 
of the great depths 
he brought streams also out of the rock and caused waters to 
run down like rivers 
and they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most high 
in the wilderness 
and they tempted god in their heart by asking meat for their 
lust 
yea they spake against god they said can god furnish a table 
in the wilderness 
behold he smote the rock that the waters gushed out and the 
streams overflowed can he give bread also can he provide flesh for 
his people 
therefore the lord heard this and was wroth so a fire was 
kindled against jacob and anger also came up against israel 
because they believed not in god and trusted not in his 
salvation 
though he had commanded the clouds from above and opened the 
doors of heaven 
and had rained down manna upon them to eat and had given them 
of the corn of heaven 
man did eat angels food he sent them meat to the full 
he caused an east wind to blow in the heaven and by his power 
he brought in the south wind 
he rained flesh also upon them as dust and feathered fowls like 
as the sand of the sea 
and he let it fall in the midst of their camp round about their 
habitations 
so they did eat and were well filled for he gave them their 
own desire 
they were not estranged from their lust but while their meat 
was yet in their mouths 
the wrath of god came upon them and slew the fattest of them 
and smote down the chosen men of israel 
for all this they sinned still and believed not for his 
wondrous works 
therefore their days did he consume in vanity and their years 
in trouble 
when he slew them then they sought him and they returned and 
enquired early after god 
and they remembered that god was their rock and the high god 
their redeemer 
nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth and they 
lied unto him with their tongues 
for their heart was not right with him neither were they 
stedfast in his covenant 
but he being full of compassion forgave their iniquity and 
destroyed them not yea many a time turned he his anger away and did 
not stir up all his wrath 
for he remembered that they were but flesh a wind that passeth 
away and cometh not again 
how oft did they provoke him in the wilderness and grieve him 
in the desert 
yea they turned back and tempted god and limited the holy one 
of israel 
they remembered not his hand nor the day when he delivered them 
from the enemy 
how he had wrought his signs in egypt and his wonders in the 
field of zoan 
and had turned their rivers into blood and their floods that 
they could not drink 
he sent divers sorts of flies among them which devoured them 
and frogs which destroyed them 
he gave also their increase unto the caterpiller and their 
labour unto the locust 
he destroyed their vines with hail and their sycomore trees 
with frost 
he gave up their cattle also to the hail and their flocks to 
hot thunderbolts 
he cast upon them the fierceness of his anger wrath and 
indignation and trouble by sending evil angels among them 
he made a way to his anger he spared not their soul from death 
but gave their life over to the pestilence 
and smote all the firstborn in egypt the chief of their 
strength in the tabernacles of ham 
but made his own people to go forth like sheep and guided them 
in the wilderness like a flock 
and he led them on safely so that they feared not but the sea 
overwhelmed their enemies 
and he brought them to the border of his sanctuary even to this 
mountain which his right hand had purchased 
he cast out the heathen also before them and divided them an 
inheritance by line and made the tribes of israel to dwell in their 
tents 
yet they tempted and provoked the most high god and kept not 
his testimonies 
but turned back and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers they 
were turned aside like a deceitful bow 
for they provoked him to anger with their high places and moved 
him to jealousy with their graven images 
when god heard this he was wroth and greatly abhorred israel 
so that he forsook the tabernacle of shiloh the tent which he 
placed among men 
and delivered his strength into captivity and his glory into 
the enemy s hand 
he gave his people over also unto the sword and was wroth with 
his inheritance 
the fire consumed their young men and their maidens were not 
given to marriage 
their priests fell by the sword and their widows made no 
lamentation 
then the lord awaked as one out of sleep and like a mighty man 
that shouteth by reason of wine 
and he smote his enemies in the hinder parts he put them to a 
perpetual reproach 
moreover he refused the tabernacle of joseph and chose not the 
tribe of ephraim 
but chose the tribe of judah the mount zion which he loved 
and he built his sanctuary like high palaces like the earth 
which he hath established for ever 
he chose david also his servant and took him from the 
sheepfolds 
from following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed 
jacob his people and israel his inheritance 
so he fed them according to the integrity of his heart and 
guided them by the skilfulness of his hands 
o god the heathen are come into thine inheritance thy holy 
temple have they defiled they have laid jerusalem on heaps 
the dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto 
the fowls of the heaven the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of 
the earth 
their blood have they she would like water round about jerusalem and 
there was none to bury them 
we are become a reproach to our neighbours a scorn and derision 
to them that are round about us 
how long lord wilt thou be angry for ever shall thy jealousy 
burn like fire 
pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee and 
upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name 
for they have devoured jacob and laid waste his dwelling place 
o remember not against us former iniquities let thy tender 
mercies speedily prevent us for we are brought very low 
help us o god of our salvation for the glory of thy name and 
deliver us and purge away our sins for thy name s sake 
wherefore should the heathen say where is their god let him be 
known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of 
thy servants which is she would 
let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee according to 
the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to 
die 
and render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their 
reproach wherewith they have reproached thee o lord 
so we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks 
for ever we will shew forth thy praise to all generations 
give ear o shepherd of israel thou that leadest joseph like a 
flock thou that dwellest between the cherubims shine forth 
before ephraim and benjamin and manasseh stir up thy strength 
and come and save us 
turn us again o god and because thy face to shine and we shall 
be saved 
o lord god of hosts how long wilt thou be angry against the 
prayer of thy people 
thou feedest them with the bread of tears and givest them tears 
to drink in great measure 
thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours and our enemies 
laugh among themselves 
turn us again o god of hosts and because thy face to shine and 
we shall be saved 
thou hast brought a vine out of egypt thou hast cast out the 
heathen and planted it 
thou preparedst room before it and didst because it to take deep 
root and it filled the land 
the hills were covered with the shadow of it and the boughs 
thereof were like the goodly cedars 
she sent out her boughs unto the sea and her branches unto the 
river 
why hast thou then broken down her hedges so that all they 
which pass by the way do pluck her 
the boar out of the wood doth waste it and the wild beast of 
the field doth devour it 
return we beseech thee o god of hosts look down from heaven 
and behold and visit this vine 
and the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted and the 
branch that thou madest strong for thyself 
it is burned with fire it is cut down they perish at the 
rebuke of thy countenance 
let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand upon the son of 
man whom thou madest strong for thyself 
so will not we go back from thee quicken us and we will call 
upon thy name 
turn us again o lord god of hosts because thy face to shine and 
we shall be saved 
sing aloud unto god our strength make a joyful noise unto the 
god of jacob 
take a psalm and bring hither the timbrel the pleasant harp 
with the psaltery 
blow up the trumpet in the new moon in the time appointed on 
our solemn feast day 
for this was a statute for israel and a law of the god of jacob 
this he ordained in joseph for a testimony when he went out 
through the land of egypt where i heard a language that i understood 
not 
i removed his shoulder from the burden his hands were delivered 
from the pots 
thou calledst in trouble and i delivered thee i answered thee 
in the secret place of thunder i proved thee at the waters of 
meribah 
selah 
hear o my people and i will testify unto thee o israel if 
thou wilt hearken unto me 
there shall no strange god be in thee neither shalt thou worship 
any strange god 
i am the lord thy god which brought thee out of the land of 
egypt open thy mouth wide and i will fill it 
but my people would not hearken to my voice and israel would 
none of me 
so i gave them up unto their own hearts lust and they walked 
in their own counsels 
oh that my people had hearkened unto me and israel had walked 
in my ways 
i should soon have subdued their enemies and turned my hand 
against their adversaries 
the haters of the lord should have submitted themselves unto 
him but their time should have endured for ever 
he should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat and 
with honey out of the rock should i have satisfied thee 
god standeth in the congregation of the mighty he judgeth among 
the gods 
how long will ye judge unjustly and accept the persons of the 
wicked selah 
defend the poor and fatherless do justice to the afflicted and 
needy 
deliver the poor and needy rid them out of the hand of the 
wicked 
they know not neither will they understand they walk on in 
darkness all the foundations of the earth are out of course 
i have said ye are gods and all of you are children of the most 
high 
but ye shall die like men and fall like one of the princes 
arise o god judge the earth for thou shalt inherit all 
nations 
keep not thou silence o god hold not thy peace and be not 
still o god 
for lo thine enemies make a tumult and they that hate thee 
have lifted up the head 
they have taken crafty counsel against thy people and consulted 
against thy hidden ones 
they have said come and let us cut them off from being a 
nation that the name of israel may be no more in remembrance 
for they have consulted together with one consent they are 
confederate against thee 
the tabernacles of edom and the ishmaelites of moab and the 
hagarenes 
gebal and ammon and amalek the philistines with the 
inhabitants of tyre 
assur also is joined with them they have holpen the children of 
lot 
selah 
do unto them as unto the midianites as to sisera as to jabin 
at the brook of kison 
which perished at endor they became as dung for the earth 
make their nobles like oreb and like zeeb yea all their 
princes as zebah and as zalmunna 
who said let us take to ourselves the houses of god in 
possession 
o my god make them like a wheel as the stubble before the 
wind 
as the fire burneth a wood and as the flame setteth the 
mountains on fire 
so persecute them with thy tempest and make them afraid with 
thy storm 
fill their faces with shame that they may seek thy name o 
lord 
let them be confounded and troubled for ever yea let them be 
put to shame and perish 
that men may know that thou whose name alone is jehovah art 
the most high over all the earth 
how amiable are thy tabernacles o lord of hosts 
my soul longeth yea even fainteth for the courts of the lord 
my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living god 
yea the sparrow hath found an house and the swallow a nest for 
herself where she may lay her young even thine altars o lord of 
hosts my king and my god 
blessed are they that dwell in thy house they will be still 
praising thee selah 
blessed is the man whose strength is in thee in whose heart are 
the ways of them 
who passing through the valley of baca make it a well the rain 
also filleth the pools 
they go from strength to strength every one of them in zion 
appeareth before god 
o lord god of hosts hear my prayer give ear o god of jacob 
selah 
behold o god our shield and look upon the face of thine 
anointed 
for a day in thy courts is better than a thousand i had rather 
be a doorkeeper in the house of my god than to dwell in the tents of 
wickedness 
for the lord god is a sun and shield the lord will give grace 
and glory no good thing will he withhold from them that walk 
uprightly 
o lord of hosts blessed is the man that trusteth in thee 
lord thou hast been favourable unto thy land thou hast brought 
back the captivity of jacob 
thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people thou hast covered 
all their sin selah 
thou hast taken away all thy wrath thou hast turned thyself from 
the fierceness of thine anger 
turn us o god of our salvation and because thine anger toward us 
to cease 
wilt thou be angry with us for ever wilt thou draw out thine 
anger to all generations 
wilt thou not revive us again that thy people may rejoice in 
thee 
shew us thy mercy o lord and grant us thy salvation 
i will hear what god the lord will speak for he will speak peace 
unto his people and to his saints but let them not turn again to 
folly 
surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him that glory may 
dwell in our land 
mercy and truth are met together righteousness and peace have 
kissed each other 
truth shall spring out of the earth and righteousness shall 
look down from heaven 
yea the lord shall give that which is good and our land shall 
yield her increase 
righteousness shall go before him and shall set us in the way 
of his steps 
bow down thine ear o lord hear me for i am poor and needy 
preserve my soul for i am holy o thou my god save thy servant 
that trusteth in thee 
be merciful unto me o lord for i cry unto thee daily 
rejoice the soul of thy servant for unto thee o lord do i lift 
up my soul 
for thou lord art good and ready to forgive and plenteous in 
mercy unto all them that call upon thee 
give ear o lord unto my prayer and attend to the voice of my 
supplications 
in the day of my trouble i will call upon thee for thou wilt 
answer me 
among the gods there is none like unto thee o lord neither are 
there any works like unto thy works 
all nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before 
thee o lord and shall glorify thy name 
for thou art great and doest wondrous things thou art god 
alone 
teach me thy way o lord i will walk in thy truth unite my 
heart to fear thy name 
i will praise thee o lord my god with all my heart and i will 
glorify thy name for evermore 
for great is thy mercy toward me and thou hast delivered my 
soul from the lowest hell 
o god the proud are risen against me and the assemblies of 
violent men have sought after my soul and have not set thee before 
them 
but thou o lord art a god full of compassion and gracious 
long suffering and plenteous in mercy and truth 
o turn unto me and have mercy upon me give thy strength unto 
thy servant and save the son of thine handmaid 
shew me a token for good that they which hate me may see it 
and be ashamed because thou lord hast holpen me and comforted me 
his foundation is in the holy mountains 
the lord loveth the gates of zion more than all the dwellings of 
jacob 
glorious things are spoken of thee o city of god selah 
i will make mention of rahab and babylon to them that know me 
behold philistia and tyre with ethiopia this man was born there 
and of zion it shall be said this and that man was born in her 
and the highest himself shall establish her 
the lord shall count when he writeth up the people that this 
man was born there selah 
as well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there 
all my springs are in thee 
o lord god of my salvation i have cried day and night before 
thee 
let my prayer come before thee incline thine ear unto my cry 
for my soul is full of troubles and my life draweth nigh unto 
the grave 
i am counted with them that go down into the pit i am as a man 
that hath no strength 
free among the dead like the slain that lie in the grave whom 
thou rememberest no more and they are cut off from thy hand 
thou hast laid me in the lowest pit in darkness in the deeps 
thy wrath lieth hard upon me and thou hast afflicted me with all 
thy waves selah 
thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me thou hast made 
me an abomination unto them i am shut up and i cannot come forth 
mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction lord i have called 
daily upon thee i have stretched out my hands unto thee 
wilt thou shew wonders to the dead shall the dead arise and 
praise thee selah 
shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave or thy 
faithfulness in destruction 
shall thy wonders be known in the dark and thy righteousness in 
the land of forgetfulness 
but unto thee have i cried o lord and in the morning shall my 
prayer prevent thee 
lord why castest thou off my soul why hidest thou thy face 
from me 
i am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up while i suffer 
thy terrors i am distracted 
thy fierce wrath goeth over me thy terrors have cut me off 
they came round about me daily like water they compassed me 
about together 
lover and friend hast thou put far from me and mine 
acquaintance into darkness 
i will sing of the mercies of the lord for ever with my mouth 
will i make known thy faithfulness to all generations 
for i have said mercy shall be built up for ever thy 
faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens 
i have made a covenant with my chosen i have sworn unto david my 
servant 
thy seed will i establish for ever and build up thy throne to 
all generations selah 
and the heavens shall praise thy wonders o lord thy 
faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints 
for who in the heaven can be compared unto the lord who among 
the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the lord 
god is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints and to 
be had in reverence of all them that are about him 
o lord god of hosts who is a strong lord like unto thee or to 
thy faithfulness round about thee 
thou rulest the raging of the sea when the waves thereof arise 
thou stillest them 
thou hast broken rahab in pieces as one that is slain thou 
hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm 
the heavens are thine the earth also is thine as for the world 
and the fulness thereof thou hast founded them 
the north and the south thou hast created them tabor and hermon 
shall rejoice in thy name 
thou hast a mighty arm strong is thy hand and high is thy 
right hand 
justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne mercy and 
truth shall go before thy face 
blessed is the people that know the joyful sound they shall 
walk o lord in the light of thy countenance 
in thy name shall they rejoice all the day and in thy 
righteousness shall they be exalted 
for thou art the glory of their strength and in thy favour our 
horn shall be exalted 
for the lord is our defence and the holy one of israel is our 
king 
then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one and saidst i have 
laid help upon one that is mighty i have exalted one chosen out of 
the people 
i have found david my servant with my holy oil have i anointed 
him 
with whom my hand shall be established mine arm also shall 
strengthen him 
the enemy shall not exact upon him nor the son of wickedness 
afflict him 
and i will beat down his foes before his face and plague them 
that hate him 
but my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him and in my 
name shall his horn be exalted 
i will set his hand also in the sea and his right hand in the 
rivers 
he shall cry unto me thou art my father my god and the rock 
of my salvation 
also i will make him my firstborn higher than the kings of the 
earth 
my mercy will i keep for him for evermore and my covenant shall 
stand fast with him 
his seed also will i make to endure for ever and his throne as 
the days of heaven 
if his children forsake my law and walk not in my judgments 
if they break my statutes and keep not my commandments 
then will i visit their transgression with the rod and their 
iniquity with stripes 
nevertheless my lovingkindness will i not utterly take from him 
nor suffer my faithfulness to fail 
my covenant will i not break nor alter the thing that is gone 
out of my lips 
once have i sworn by my holiness that i will not lie unto david 
his seed shall endure for ever and his throne as the sun before 
me 
it shall be established for ever as the moon and as a faithful 
witness in heaven selah 
but thou hast cast off and abhorred thou hast been wroth with 
thine anointed 
thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant thou hast 
profaned his crown by casting it to the ground 
thou hast broken down all his hedges thou hast brought his 
strong holds to ruin 
all that pass by the way spoil him he is a reproach to his 
neighbours 
thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries thou hast 
made all his enemies to rejoice 
thou hast also turned the edge of his sword and hast not made 
him to stand in the battle 
thou hast made his glory to cease and cast his throne down to 
the ground 
the days of his youth hast thou shortened thou hast covered him 
with shame selah 
how long lord wilt thou hide thyself for ever shall thy wrath 
burn like fire 
remember how short my time is wherefore hast thou made all men 
in vain 
what man is he that liveth and shall not see death shall he 
deliver his soul from the hand of the grave selah 
lord where are thy former lovingkindnesses which thou swarest 
unto david in thy truth 
remember lord the reproach of thy servants how i do bear in 
my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people 
wherewith thine enemies have reproached o lord wherewith they 
have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed 
blessed be the lord for evermore amen and amen 
lord thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations 
before the mountains were brought forth or ever thou hadst 
formed the earth and the world even from everlasting to everlasting 
thou art god 
thou turnest man to destruction and sayest return ye children 
of men 
for a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is 
past and as a watch in the night 
thou carriest them away as with a flood they are as a sleep in 
the morning they are like grass which groweth up 
in the morning it flourisheth and groweth up in the evening it 
is cut down and withereth 
for we are consumed by thine anger and by thy wrath are we 
troubled 
thou hast set our iniquities before thee our secret sins in the 
light of thy countenance 
for all our days are passed away in thy wrath we spend our years 
as a tale that is told 
the days of our years are threescore years and ten and if by 
reason of strength they be fourscore years yet is their strength 
labour and sorrow for it is soon cut off and we fly away 
who knoweth the power of thine anger even according to thy 
fear so is thy wrath 
so teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts 
unto wisdom 
return o lord how long and let it repent thee concerning thy 
servants 
o satisfy us early with thy mercy that we may rejoice and be 
glad all our days 
make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted 
us and the years wherein we have seen evil 
let thy work appear unto thy servants and thy glory unto their 
children 
and let the beauty of the lord our god be upon us and establish 
thou the work of our hands upon us yea the work of our hands 
establish thou it 
he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide 
under the shadow of the almighty 
i will say of the lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god 
in him will i trust 
surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and 
from the noisome pestilence 
he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt 
thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler 
thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the 
arrow that flieth by day 
nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the 
destruction that wasteth at noonday 
a thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right 
hand but it shall not come nigh thee 
only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the 
wicked 
because thou hast made the lord which is my refuge even the 
most high thy habitation 
there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come 
nigh thy dwelling 
for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in 
all thy ways 
they shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou dash thy foot 
against a stone 
thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder the young lion and the 
dragon shalt thou trample under feet 
because he hath set his love upon me therefore will i deliver 
him i will set him on high because he hath known my name 
he shall call upon me and i will answer him i will be with him 
in trouble i will deliver him and honour him 
with long life will i satisfy him and shew him my salvation 
it is a good thing to give thanks unto the lord and to sing 
praises unto thy name o most high 
to shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning and thy 
faithfulness every night 
upon an instrument of ten strings and upon the psaltery upon 
the harp with a solemn sound 
for thou lord hast made me glad through thy work i will 
triumph in the works of thy hands 
o lord how great are thy works and thy thoughts are very deep 
a brutish man knoweth not neither doth a fool understand this 
when the wicked spring as the grass and when all the workers of 
iniquity do flourish it is that they shall be destroyed for ever 
but thou lord art most high for evermore 
for lo thine enemies o lord for lo thine enemies shall 
perish all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered 
but my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn i 
shall be anointed with fresh oil 
mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies and mine ears 
shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me 
the righteous shall flourish like the palm tree he shall grow 
like a cedar in lebanon 
those that be planted in the house of the lord shall flourish in 
the courts of our god 
they shall still bring forth fruit in old age they shall be fat 
and flourishing 
to shew that the lord is upright he is my rock and there is no 
unrighteousness in him 
the lord reigneth he is clothed with majesty the lord is 
clothed with strength wherewith he hath girded himself the world 
also is stablished that it cannot be moved 
thy throne is established of old thou art from everlasting 
the floods have lifted up o lord the floods have lifted up 
their voice the floods lift up their waves 
the lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters yea 
than the mighty waves of the sea 
thy testimonies are very sure holiness becometh thine house o 
lord for ever 
o lord god to whom vengeance belongeth o god to whom vengeance 
belongeth shew thyself 
lift up thyself thou judge of the earth render a reward to the 
proud 
lord how long shall the wicked how long shall the wicked 
triumph 
how long shall they utter and speak hard things and all the 
workers of iniquity boast themselves 
they break in pieces thy people o lord and afflict thine 
heritage 
they slay the widow and the stranger and murder the fatherless 
yet they say the lord shall not see neither shall the god of 
jacob regard it 
understand ye brutish among the people and ye fools when will 
ye be wise 
he that planted the ear shall he not hear he that formed the 
eye shall he not see 
he that chastiseth the heathen shall not he correct he that 
teacheth man knowledge shall not he know 
the lord knoweth the thoughts of man that they are vanity 
blessed is the man whom thou chastenest o lord and teachest 
him out of thy law 
that thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity until 
the pit be digged for the wicked 
for the lord will not cast off his people neither will he 
forsake his inheritance 
but judgment shall return unto righteousness and all the 
upright in heart shall follow it 
who will rise up for me against the evildoers or who will stand 
up for me against the workers of iniquity 
unless the lord had been my help my soul had almost dwelt in 
silence 
when i said my foot slippeth thy mercy o lord held me up 
in the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight 
my soul 
shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee which 
frameth mischief by a law 
they gather themselves together against the soul of the 
righteous and condemn the innocent blood 
but the lord is my defence and my god is the rock of my refuge 
and he shall bring upon them their own iniquity and shall cut 
them off in their own wickedness yea the lord our god shall cut them 
off 
o come let us sing unto the lord let us make a joyful noise to 
the rock of our salvation 
let us come before his presence with thanksgiving and make a 
joyful noise unto him with psalms 
for the lord is a great god and a great king above all gods 
in his hand are the deep places of the earth the strength of the 
hills is his also 
the sea is his and he made it and his hands formed the dry 
land 
o come let us worship and bow down let us kneel before the lord 
our maker 
for he is our god and we are the people of his pasture and the 
sheep of his hand to day if ye will hear his voice 
harden not your heart as in the provocation and as in the day 
of temptation in the wilderness 
when your fathers tempted me proved me and saw my work 
forty years long was i grieved with this generation and said 
it is a people that do err in their heart and they have not known my 
ways 
unto whom i sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my 
rest 
o sing unto the lord a new song sing unto the lord all the 
earth

day to day

people

heavens

sanctuary

lord glory and strength

people righteously

roar and the fulness thereof 
let the field be joyful and all that is therein then shall all 
the trees of the wood rejoice 
before the lord for he cometh for he cometh to judge the 
earth he shall judge the world with righteousness and the people 
with his truth 
the lord reigneth let the earth rejoice let the multitude of 
isles be glad thereof 
clouds and darkness are round about him righteousness and 
judgment are the habitation of his throne

his lightnings enlightened the world the earth saw and 
trembled

presence of the lord of the whole earth

glory

themselves of idols worship him all ye gods

because of thy judgments o lord 
for thou lord art high above all the earth thou art exalted

saints he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked

things his right hand and his holy arm hath gotten him the victory

equity thou executest judgment and righteousness in jacob 
exalt ye the lord our god and worship at his footstool for he 
is holy 
moses and aaron among his priests and samuel among them that 
call upon his name they called upon the lord and he answered them 
he spake unto them in the cloudy pillar they kept his 
testimonies and the ordinance that he gave them 
thou answeredst them o lord our god thou wast a god that 
forgavest them though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions 
exalt the lord our god and worship at his holy hill for the 
lord our god is holy

praise be thankful unto him and bless his name 
for the lord is good his mercy is everlasting and his truth 
endureth to all generations 
i will sing of mercy and judgment unto thee o lord will i 
sing 
i will behave myself wisely in a perfect way o when wilt thou 
come unto me i will walk within my house with a perfect heart 
i will set no wicked thing before mine eyes i hate the work of 
them that turn aside it shall not cleave to me 
a froward heart shall depart from me i will not know a wicked 
person 
whoso privily slandereth his neighbour him will i cut off him 
that hath an high look and a proud heart will not i suffer 
mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land that they may 
dwell with me he that walketh in a perfect way he shall serve me 
he that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house he that 
telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight 
i will early destroy all the wicked of the land that i may cut 
off all wicked doers from the city of the lord 
hear my prayer o lord and let my cry come unto thee 
hide not thy face from me in the day when i am in trouble 
incline thine ear unto me in the day when i call answer me speedily 
for my days are consumed like smoke and my bones are burned as 
an hearth 
my heart is smitten and withered like grass so that i forget 
to eat my bread 
by reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my 
skin 
i am like a pelican of the wilderness i am like an owl of the 
desert 
i watch and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top 
mine enemies reproach me all the day and they that are mad 
against me are sworn against me 
for i have eaten ashes like bread and mingled my drink with 
weeping 
because of thine indignation and thy wrath for thou hast 
lifted me up and cast me down 
my days are like a shadow that declineth and i am withered 
like grass 
but thou o lord shall endure for ever and thy remembrance 
unto all generations 
thou shalt arise and have mercy upon zion for the time to 
favour her yea the set time is come 
for thy servants take pleasure in her stones and favour the 
dust thereof 
so the heathen shall fear the name of the lord and all the 
kings of the earth thy glory 
when the lord shall build up zion he shall appear in his 
glory 
he will regard the prayer of the destitute and not despise 
their prayer 
this shall be written for the generation to come and the 
people which shall be created shall praise the lord 
for he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary from 
heaven did the lord behold the earth 
to hear the groaning of the prisoner to loose those that are 
appointed to death 
to declare the name of the lord in zion and his praise in 
jerusalem 
when the people are gathered together and the kingdoms to 
serve the lord 
he weakened my strength in the way he shortened my days 
i said o my god take me not away in the midst of my days thy 
years are throughout all generations 
of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth and the 
heavens are the work of thy hands 
they shall perish but thou shalt endure yea all of them 
shall wax old like a garment as a vesture shalt thou change them and 
they shall be changed 
but thou art the same and thy years shall have no end 
the children of thy servants shall continue and their seed 
shall be established before thee 
bless the lord o my soul and all that is within me bless his 
holy name 
bless the lord o my soul and forget not all his benefits 
who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy 
diseases 
who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowneth thee with 
lovingkindness and tender mercies 
who satisfieth thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is 
renewed like the eagle s 
the lord executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are 
oppressed 
he made known his ways unto moses his acts unto the children of 
israel 
the lord is merciful and gracious slow to anger and plenteous 
in mercy 
he will not always chide neither will he keep his anger for 
ever 
he hath not dealt with us after our sins nor rewarded us 
according to our iniquities 
for as the heaven is high above the earth so great is his 
mercy toward them that fear him 
as far as the east is from the west so far hath he removed our 
transgressions from us 
like as a father pitieth his children so the lord pitieth them 
that fear him 
for he knoweth our frame he remembereth that we are dust 
as for man his days are as grass as a flower of the field so 
he flourisheth 
for the wind passeth over it and it is gone and the place 
thereof shall know it no more 
but the mercy of the lord is from everlasting to everlasting 
upon them that fear him and his righteousness unto children s 
children 
to such as keep his covenant and to those that remember his 
commandments to do them 
the lord hath prepared his throne in the heavens and his 
kingdom ruleth over all 
bless the lord ye his angels that excel in strength that do 
his commandments hearkening unto the voice of his word 
bless ye the lord all ye his hosts ye ministers of his that 
do his pleasure 
bless the lord all his works in all places of his dominion 
bless the lord o my soul 
bless the lord o my soul o lord my god thou art very great 
thou art clothed with honour and majesty 
who coverest thyself with light as with a garment who 
stretchest out the heavens like a curtain 
who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters who maketh 
the clouds his chariot who walketh upon the wings of the wind 
who maketh his angels spirits his ministers a flaming fire 
who laid the foundations of the earth that it should not be 
removed for ever 
thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment the waters 
stood above the mountains 
at thy rebuke they fled at the voice of thy thunder they hasted 
away 
they go up by the mountains they go down by the valleys unto 
the place which thou hast founded for them 
thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over that they 
turn not again to cover the earth 
he sendeth the springs into the valleys which run among the 
hills 
they give drink to every beast of the field the wild asses 
quench their thirst 
by them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation 
which sing among the branches 
he watereth the hills from his chambers the earth is satisfied 
with the fruit of thy works 
he causeth the grass to grow for the cattle and herb for the 
service of man that he may bring forth food out of the earth 
and wine that maketh glad the heart of man and oil to make his 
face to shine and bread which strengtheneth man s heart 
the trees of the lord are full of sap the cedars of lebanon 
which he hath planted 
where the birds make their nests as for the stork the fir 
trees are her house 
the high hills are a refuge for the wild goats and the rocks 
for the conies 
he appointed the moon for seasons the sun knoweth his going 
down 
thou makest darkness and it is night wherein all the beasts 
of the forest do creep forth 
the young lions roar after their prey and seek their meat from 
god 
the sun ariseth they gather themselves together and lay them 
down in their dens 
man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the 
evening 
o lord how manifold are thy works in wisdom hast thou made 
them all the earth is full of thy riches 
so is this great and wide sea wherein are things creeping 
innumerable both small and great beasts 
there go the ships there is that leviathan whom thou hast 
made to play therein 
these wait all upon thee that thou mayest give them their meat 
in due season 
that thou givest them they gather thou openest thine hand 
they are filled with good 
thou hidest thy face they are troubled thou takest away their 
breath they die and return to their dust 
thou sendest forth thy spirit they are created and thou 
renewest the face of the earth 
the glory of the lord shall endure for ever the lord shall 
rejoice in his works 
he looketh on the earth and it trembleth he toucheth the 
hills and they smoke 
i will sing unto the lord as long as i live i will sing praise 
to my god while i have my being 
my meditation of him shall be sweet i will be glad in the 
lord 
let the sinners be consumed out of the earth and let the 
wicked be no more bless thou the lord o my soul praise ye the lord 
o give thanks unto the lord call upon his name make known his 
deeds among the people 
sing unto him sing psalms unto him talk ye of all his wondrous 
works 
glory ye in his holy name let the heart of them rejoice that 
seek the lord 
seek the lord and his strength seek his face evermore 
remember his marvellous works that he hath done his wonders 
and the judgments of his mouth 
o ye seed of abraham his servant ye children of jacob his 
chosen 
he is the lord our god his judgments are in all the earth 
he hath remembered his covenant for ever the word which he 
commanded to a thousand generations 
which covenant he made with abraham and his oath unto isaac 
and confirmed the same unto jacob for a law and to israel for 
an everlasting covenant 
saying unto thee will i give the land of canaan the lot of 
your inheritance 
when they were but a few men in number yea very few and 
strangers in it 
when they went from one nation to another from one kingdom to 
another people 
he suffered no man to do them wrong yea he reproved kings for 
their sakes 
saying touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm 
moreover he called for a famine upon the land he brake the 
whole staff of bread 
he sent a man before them even joseph who was sold for a 
servant 
whose feet they hurt with fetters he was laid in iron 
until the time that his word came the word of the lord tried 
him 
the king sent and loosed him even the ruler of the people and 
let him go free 
he made him lord of his house and ruler of all his substance 
to bind his princes at his pleasure and teach his senators 
wisdom 
israel also came into egypt and jacob sojourned in the land of 
ham 
and he increased his people greatly and made them stronger 
than their enemies 
he turned their heart to hate his people to deal subtilly with 
his servants 
he sent moses his servant and aaron whom he had chosen 
they shewed his signs among them and wonders in the land of 
ham 
he sent darkness and made it dark and they rebelled not 
against his word 
he turned their waters into blood and slew their fish 
their land brought forth frogs in abundance in the chambers of 
their kings 
he spake and there came divers sorts of flies and lice in all 
their coasts 
he gave them hail for rain and flaming fire in their land 
he smote their vines also and their fig trees and brake the 
trees of their coasts 
he spake and the locusts came and caterpillers and that 
without number 
and did eat up all the herbs in their land and devoured the 
fruit of their ground 
he smote also all the firstborn in their land the chief of all 
their strength 
he brought them forth also with silver and gold and there was 
not one feeble person among their tribes 
egypt was glad when they departed for the fear of them fell 
upon them 
he spread a cloud for a covering and fire to give light in the 
night 
the people asked and he brought quails and satisfied them 
with the bread of heaven 
he opened the rock and the waters gushed out they ran in the 
dry places like a river 
for he remembered his holy promise and abraham his servant 
and he brought forth his people with joy and his chosen with 
gladness 
and gave them the lands of the heathen and they inherited the 
labour of the people 
that they might observe his statutes and keep his laws praise 
ye the lord 
praise ye the lord o give thanks unto the lord for he is good 
for his mercy endureth for ever 
who can utter the mighty acts of the lord who can shew forth 
all his praise 
blessed are they that keep judgment and he that doeth 
righteousness at all times 
remember me o lord with the favour that thou bearest unto thy 
people o visit me with thy salvation 
that i may see the good of thy chosen that i may rejoice in the 
gladness of thy nation that i may glory with thine inheritance 
we have sinned with our fathers we have committed iniquity we 
have done wickedly 
our fathers understood not thy wonders in egypt they remembered 
not the multitude of thy mercies but provoked him at the sea even at 
the red sea 
nevertheless he saved them for his name s sake that he might 
make his mighty power to be known 
he rebuked the red sea also and it was dried up so he led them 
through the depths as through the wilderness 
and he saved them from the hand of him that hated them and 
redeemed them from the hand of the enemy 
and the waters covered their enemies there was not one of them 
left 
then believed they his words they sang his praise 
they soon forgat his works they waited not for his counsel 
but lusted exceedingly in the wilderness and tempted god in 
the desert 
and he gave them their request but sent leanness into their 
soul 
they envied moses also in the camp and aaron the saint of the 
lord 
the earth opened and swallowed up dathan and covered the 
company of abiram 
and a fire was kindled in their company the flame burned up 
the wicked 
they made a calf in horeb and worshipped the molten image 
thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that 
eateth grass 
they forgat god their saviour which had done great things in 
egypt 
wondrous works in the land of ham and terrible things by the 
red sea 
therefore he said that he would destroy them had not moses his 
chosen stood before him in the breach to turn away his wrath lest he 
should destroy them 
yea they despised the pleasant land they believed not his 
word 
but murmured in their tents and hearkened not unto the voice 
of the lord 
therefore he lifted up his hand against them to overthrow them 
in the wilderness 
to overthrow their seed also among the nations and to scatter 
them in the lands 
they joined themselves also unto baalpeor and ate the 
sacrifices of the dead 
thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions and the 
plague brake in upon them 
then stood up phinehas and executed judgment and so the 
plague was stayed 
and that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all 
generations for evermore 
they angered him also at the waters of strife so that it went 
ill with moses for their sakes 
because they provoked his spirit so that he spake unadvisedly 
with his lips 
they did not destroy the nations concerning whom the lord 
commanded them 
but were mingled among the heathen and learned their works 
and they served their idols which were a snare unto them 
yea they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto 
devils 
and she would innocent blood even the blood of their sons and of 
their daughters whom they sacrificed unto the idols of canaan and 
the land was polluted with blood 
thus were they defiled with their own works and went a whoring 
with their own inventions 
therefore was the wrath of the lord kindled against his people 
insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance 
and he gave them into the hand of the heathen and they that 
hated them ruled over them 
their enemies also oppressed them and they were brought into 
subjection under their hand 
many times did he deliver them but they provoked him with 
their counsel and were brought low for their iniquity 
nevertheless he regarded their affliction when he heard their 
cry 
and he remembered for them his covenant and repented according 
to the multitude of his mercies 
he made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them 
captives 
save us o lord our god and gather us from among the heathen 
to give thanks unto thy holy name and to triumph in thy praise 
blessed be the lord god of israel from everlasting to 
everlasting and let all the people say amen praise ye the lord 
o give thanks unto the lord for he is good for his mercy 
endureth for ever 
let the redeemed of the lord say so whom he hath redeemed from 
the hand of the enemy 
and gathered them out of the lands from the east and from the 
west from the north and from the south 
they wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way they found no 
city to dwell in 
hungry and thirsty their soul fainted in them 
then they cried unto the lord in their trouble and he delivered 
them out of their distresses 
and he led them forth by the right way that they might go to a 
city of habitation 
oh that men would praise the lord for his goodness and for his 
wonderful works to the children of men 
for he satisfieth the longing soul and filleth the hungry soul 
with goodness 
such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death being bound 
in affliction and iron 
because they rebelled against the words of god and contemned 
the counsel of the most high 
therefore he brought down their heart with labour they fell 
down and there was none to help 
then they cried unto the lord in their trouble and he saved 
them out of their distresses 
he brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death and 
brake their bands in sunder 
oh that men would praise the lord for his goodness and for his 
wonderful works to the children of men 
for he hath broken the gates of brass and cut the bars of iron 
in sunder 
fools because of their transgression and because of their 
iniquities are afflicted 
their soul abhorreth all manner of meat and they draw near 
unto the gates of death 
then they cry unto the lord in their trouble and he saveth 
them out of their distresses 
he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from 
their destructions 
oh that men would praise the lord for his goodness and for his 
wonderful works to the children of men 
and let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving and 
declare his works with rejoicing 
they that go down to the sea in ships that do business in 
great waters 
these see the works of the lord and his wonders in the deep 
for he commandeth and raiseth the stormy wind which lifteth 
up the waves thereof 
they mount up to the heaven they go down again to the depths 
their soul is melted because of trouble 
they reel to and fro and stagger like a drunken man and are 
at their wit s end 
then they cry unto the lord in their trouble and he bringeth 
them out of their distresses 
he maketh the storm a calm so that the waves thereof are 
still 
then are they glad because they be quiet so he bringeth them 
unto their desired haven 
oh that men would praise the lord for his goodness and for his 
wonderful works to the children of men 
let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people and 
praise him in the assembly of the elders 
he turneth rivers into a wilderness and the watersprings into 
dry ground 
a fruitful land into barrenness for the wickedness of them 
that dwell therein 
he turneth the wilderness into a standing water and dry ground 
into watersprings 
and there he maketh the hungry to dwell that they may prepare 
a city for habitation 
and sow the fields and plant vineyards which may yield fruits 
of increase 
he blesseth them also so that they are multiplied greatly and 
suffereth not their cattle to decrease 
again they are minished and brought low through oppression 
affliction and sorrow 
he poureth contempt upon princes and causeth them to wander in 
the wilderness where there is no way 
yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction and maketh him 
families like a flock 
the righteous shall see it and rejoice and all iniquity shall 
stop her mouth 
whoso is wise and will observe these things even they shall 
understand the lovingkindness of the lord 
o god my heart is fixed i will sing and give praise even with 
my glory 
awake psaltery and harp i myself will awake early 
i will praise thee o lord among the people and i will sing 
praises unto thee among the nations 
for thy mercy is great above the heavens and thy truth reacheth 
unto the clouds 
be thou exalted o god above the heavens and thy glory above 
all the earth 
that thy beloved may be delivered save with thy right hand and 
answer me 
god hath spoken in his holiness i will rejoice i will divide 
shechem and mete out the valley of succoth 
gilead is mine manasseh is mine ephraim also is the strength 
of mine head judah is my lawgiver 
moab is my washpot over edom will i cast out my shoe over 
philistia will i triumph 
who will bring me into the strong city who will lead me into 
edom 
wilt not thou o god who hast cast us off and wilt not thou 
o god go forth with our hosts 
give us help from trouble for vain is the help of man 
through god we shall do valiantly for he it is that shall 
tread down our enemies 
hold not thy peace o god of my praise 
for the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are 
opened against me they have spoken against me with a lying tongue 
they compassed me about also with words of hatred and fought 
against me without a because 
for my love they are my adversaries but i give myself unto 
prayer 
and they have rewarded me evil for good and hatred for my love 
set thou a wicked man over him and let satan stand at his right 
hand 
when he shall be judged let him be condemned and let his 
prayer become sin 
let his days be few and let another take his office 
let his children be fatherless and his wife a widow 
let his children be continually vagabonds and beg let them 
seek their bread also out of their desolate places 
let the extortioner catch all that he hath and let the 
strangers spoil his labour 
let there be none to extend mercy unto him neither let there 
be any to favour his fatherless children 
let his posterity be cut off and in the generation following 
let their name be blotted out 
let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the lord 
and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out 
let them be before the lord continually that he may cut off 
the memory of them from the earth 
because that he remembered not to shew mercy but persecuted 
the poor and needy man that he might even slay the broken in heart 
as he loved cursing so let it come unto him as he delighted 
not in blessing so let it be far from him 
as he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment so 
let it come into his bowels like water and like oil into his bones 
let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him and for a 
girdle wherewith he is girded continually 
let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the lord and 
of them that speak evil against my soul 
but do thou for me o god the lord for thy name s sake 
because thy mercy is good deliver thou me 
for i am poor and needy and my heart is wounded within me 
i am gone like the shadow when it declineth i am tossed up and 
down as the locust 
my knees are weak through fasting and my flesh faileth of 
fatness 
i became also a reproach unto them when they looked upon me 
they shaked their heads 
help me o lord my god o save me according to thy mercy 
that they may know that this is thy hand that thou lord hast 
done it 
let them curse but bless thou when they arise let them be 
ashamed but let thy servant rejoice 
let mine adversaries be clothed with shame and let them cover 
themselves with their own confusion as with a mantle 
i will greatly praise the lord with my mouth yea i will 
praise him among the multitude 
for he shall stand at the right hand of the poor to save him 
from those that condemn his soul 
the lord said unto my lord sit thou at my right hand until i 
make thine enemies thy footstool 
the lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of zion rule 
thou in the midst of thine enemies 
thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power in the 
beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning thou hast the dew 
of thy youth 
the lord hath sworn and will not repent thou art a priest for 
ever after the order of melchizedek 
the lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day 
of his wrath 
he shall judge among the heathen he shall fill the places with 
the dead bodies he shall wound the heads over many countries 
he shall drink of the brook in the way therefore shall he lift 
up the head 
praise ye the lord i will praise the lord with my whole heart

heavens 
who is like unto the lord our god who dwelleth on high 
who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven 
and in the earth

out of the dunghill

people

mother of children praise ye the lord 
when israel went out of egypt the house of jacob from a people 
of strange language 
judah was his sanctuary and israel his dominion 
the sea saw it and fled jordan was driven back 
the mountains skipped like rams and the little hills like 
lambs 
what ailed thee o thou sea that thou fleddest thou jordan 
that thou wast driven back 
ye mountains that ye skipped like rams and ye little hills 
like lambs 
tremble thou earth at the presence of the lord at the 
presence of the god of jacob 
which turned the rock into a standing water the flint into a 
fountain of waters 
not unto us o lord not unto us but unto thy name give glory 
for thy mercy and for thy truth s sake 
wherefore should the heathen say where is now their god 
but our god is in the heavens he hath done whatsoever he hath 
pleased 
their idols are silver and gold the work of men s hands 
they have mouths but they speak not eyes have they but they 
see not 
they have ears but they hear not noses have they but they 
smell not 
they have hands but they handle not feet have they but they 
walk not neither speak they through their throat 
they that make them are like unto them so is every one that 
trusteth in them 
o israel trust thou in the lord he is their help and their 
shield 
o house of aaron trust in the lord he is their help and their 
shield

the lord shall increase you more and more you and your 
children 
ye are blessed of the lord which made heaven and earth 
the heaven even the heavens are the lord s but the earth 
hath he given to the children of men 
the dead praise not the lord neither any that go down into 
silence 
but we will bless the lord from this time forth and for 
evermore

set me in a large place 
the lord is on my side i will not fear what can man do unto 
me 
the lord taketh my part with them that help me therefore shall 
i see my desire upon them that hate me 
it is better to trust in the lord than to put confidence in man 
it is better to trust in the lord than to put confidence in 
princes 
all nations compassed me about but in the name of the lord 
will i destroy them 
they compassed me about yea they compassed me about but in 
the name of the lord i will destroy them
